</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3339');"><p>A light snow was falling. Bran could feel the flakes on his face, melting as they touched his skin like the gentlest of rains. He sat straight atop his horse, watching as the iron portcullis was winched upward. Try as he might to keep calm, his heart was fluttering in his chest.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3339" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>天空下着细雪，布兰可以感觉到脸上飘落的雪花，一碰皮肤便即融化，像阵轻柔的雨。他笔直地骑在马上，看着铁闸门被绞盘向上拉起。他虽竭力想保持镇定，心脏却一直在胸口狂跳个不停。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3340');"><p>"Are you ready?" Robb asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3340" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“准备好了吗？”罗柏问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3341');"><p>Bran nodded, trying not to let his fear show. He had not been outside Winterfell since his fall, but he was determined to ride out as proud as any knight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3341" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰点点头，试着不露出害怕的神色。虽然自坠楼以来，他便没有踏出过临冬城一步，但他打定主意要像个骑士一样昂首骑马出去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3342');"><p>"Let’s ride, then." Robb put his heels into his big grey-and-white gelding, and the horse walked under the portcullis.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3342" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那我们走吧。”罗柏一夹马肚，骑着他那匹灰白相间的大公马穿过闸门。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3343');"><p>"Go," Bran whispered to his own horse. He touched her neck lightly, and the small chestnut filly started forward. Bran had named her Dancer. She was two years old, and Joseth said she was smarter than any horse had a right to be. They had trained her special, to respond to rein and voice and touch. Up to now, Bran had only ridden her around the yard. At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her, while Bran sat strapped to her back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for him, but for the past fortnight he had been riding her on his own, trotting her round and round, and growing bolder with every circuit.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3343" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“前进。”布兰向自己的坐骑耳语。他轻触它的脖子，栗子色的小母马便迈步向前。布兰为它取名“小舞”。它今年两岁，乔赛斯说它聪明得不像马。他们已经对它进行过特别训练，让它对缰绳、声音和碰触有反应，但到目前为止，布兰只是骑它绕绕广场。最初乔赛斯或阿多会牵着它，布兰则被绑在它背上那个超大的马鞍上——马鞍是照小恶魔的舔计图打造的。不过这两个星期以来，他已经能独自驾驭，骑着它来回慢跑，每绕一圈，胆子就更大。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3344');"><p>They passed beneath the gatehouse, over the drawbridge, through the outer walls. Summer and Grey Wind came loping beside them, sniffing at the wind. Close behind came Theon Greyjoy, with his longbow and a quiver of broadheads; he had a mind to take a deer, he had told them. He was followed by four guardsmen in mailed shirts and coifs, and Joseth, a stick-thin stableman whom Robb had named master of horse while Hullen was away. Maester Luwin brought up the rear, riding on a donkey. Bran would have liked it better if he and Robb had gone off alone, just the two of them, but Hal Mollen would not hear of it, and Maester Luwin backed him. If Bran fell off his horse or injured himself, the maester was determined to be with him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3344" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们穿过城门楼，越过吊桥，走出外城墙。夏天和灰风跑在他们身畔，嗅着风中的气息。紧跟在后的是带着长弓和羽箭的席恩•葛雷乔伊。出发前他说过，今天定要猎头鹿回去。在他后面的是四个穿着锁子甲，戴着锁甲头套的卫士，以及骨瘦如柴的乔赛斯。胡伦离开之后，罗柏便指派乔赛斯担任新的马房总管。鲁温师傅骑着驴子殿后。布兰本来希望就他和罗柏两个人出去，但哈尔•莫兰不肯答应，鲁温师傅也持相同意见。为防布兰落马或负伤，师傅打定主意随侍在旁。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3345');"><p>Beyond the castle lay the market square, its wooden stalls deserted now. They rode down the muddy streets of the village, past rows of small neat houses of log and undressed stone. Less than one in five were occupied, thin tendrils of woodsmoke curling up from their chimneys. The rest would fill up one by one as it grew colder. When the snow fell and the ice winds howled down out of the north, Old Nan said, farmers left their frozen fields and distant holdfasts, loaded up their wagons, and then the winter town came alive. Bran had never seen it happen, but Maester Luwin said the day was looming closer. The end of the long summer was near at hand. Winter is coming.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3345" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>城堡外便是市集广场，只是如今木头搭建的摊位全部荒废。他们行经镇里的泥泞街道，穿过排列整齐，用木材和粗石建成的小屋。眼下只有不到五分之一的房屋有人迹，几缕细细的柴烟从烟囱升起。随着天气越趋寒冷，其余的空屋也会渐渐住满。老奶妈说，等到降雪时节来临，冰风从北吹来，农民们便会离开他们结冻的田地和遥远的村舍，把行李载上马车运到镇内居住，然后避冬市镇便会热闹起来。布兰从没见过这番景象，但鲁温师傅说那样的日子就快来了。因为长夏已尽，凛冬将至。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3346');"><p>A few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past, and one man dropped the wood he was carrying as he shrank away in fear, but most of the townfolk had grown used to the sight. They bent the knee when they saw the boys, and Robb greeted each of them with a lordly nod.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3346" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们骑马经过时，有几个村民不安地看着冰原狼，还有一个人丢下抱着的木材，害怕得慌忙躲开，不过大多数村民早巳习惯了这种情景。看到两个男孩，他们单膝跪下，而罗柏也颇有领主风范地一一颔首致意。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3347');"><p>With his legs unable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse made Bran feel unsteady at first, but the huge saddle with its thick horn and high back cradled him comfortingly, and the straps around his chest and thighs would not allow him to fall. After a time the rhythm began to feel almost natural. His anxiety faded, and a tremulous smile crept across his face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3347" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>因为双脚无法用力夹紧，骑马时的晃动起初使布兰觉得很不安稳，但大马鞍厚实高耸的靠背，却如摇篮一般舒服地搂着他，而绑住大腿和胸部的皮带也让他不致落马。经过一段时间，他渐渐习惯了摇晃的节奏，焦虑褪去，一抹害怕的微笑爬上了脸庞。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3348');"><p>Two serving wenches stood beneath the sign of the Smoking Log, the local alehouse. When Theon Greyjoy called out to them, the younger girl turned red and covered her face. Theon spurred his mount to move up beside Robb. "Sweet Kyra," he said with a laugh. "She squirms like a weasel in bed, but say a word to her on the street, and she blushes pink as a maid. Did I ever tell you about the night that she and Bessa..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3348" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两个女侍站在烟柴酒馆的招牌下。当席恩•葛雷乔伊向她们打招呼时，比较年轻的那个女孩满面通红，用手遮脸。席恩踢马跑到罗柏旁边。“凯拉真可爱，”他笑道，“在床上她扭得像只黄鼠狼，可在街上跟她一句话还没说完，脸就红了，好像自己还是个黄花闺女似的。我有没有跟你说过那天晚上她和贝莎——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3349');"><p>"Not where my brother can hear, Theon," Robb warned him with a glance at Bran.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3349" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“席恩，不要在我弟弟面前讲这种事。”罗柏告诫他，又瞄了布兰一眼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3350');"><p>Bran looked away and pretended not to have heard, but he could feel Greyjoy’s eyes on him. No doubt he was smiling. He smiled a lot, as if the world were a secret joke that only he was clever enough to understand. Robb seemed to admire Theon and enjoy his company, but Bran had never warmed to his father’s ward.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3350" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰望向别处，假装自己没听到，但他感觉得到葛雷乔伊的视线落在身上。可想而知，此刻的他一定正在微笑。他一天到晚微笑，仿佛整个世界就是个秘密的玩笑，而惟有聪明的他能理解。罗柏似乎对席恩颇为佩服，也很喜欢与他为伴，但布兰始终无法对父亲的养子产生感情。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3351');"><p>Robb rode closer. "You are doing well, Bran."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3351" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏靠过来。“布兰，你骑得很好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3352');"><p>"I want to go faster," Bran replied.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3352" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想再骑快点。”布兰回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3353');"><p>Robb smiled. "As you will." He sent his gelding into a trot. The wolves raced after him. Bran snapped the reins sharply, and Dancer picked up her pace. He heard a shout from Theon Greyjoy, and the hoofbeats of the other horses behind him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3353" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏微笑，“没问题。”说完他策马开跑，狼群跟在他后面冲了出去。布兰用力一扯缰绳，小舞也加快步伐。他听见席恩•葛雷乔伊一声吆喝，以及身后杂沓的马蹄声。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3354');"><p>Bran’s cloak billowed out, rippling in the wind, and the snow seemed to rush at his face. Robb was well ahead, glancing back over his shoulder from time to time to make sure Bran and the others were following. He snapped the reins again. Smooth as silk, Dancer slid into a gallop. The distance closed. By the time he caught Robb on the edge of the wolfswood, two miles beyond the winter town, they had left the others well behind. "I can ride!" Bran shouted, grinning. It felt almost as good as flying.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3354" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰的披风在风中翻腾犹如波浪，落雪迎面扑来。罗柏遥遥领先，不时回头张望，确定布兰和其他人跟上。他再度扯缰，小舞如滑丝般流畅地迈步疾奔。两人的距离逐渐拉近，等他在避冬市镇两里外的狼林边缘追上罗柏时，他们已把其他人远远抛在后方。“我能骑马了！”布兰嘻嘻笑着大叫，这种感觉好像飞。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3355');"><p>"I’d race you, but I fear you’d win." Robb’s tone was light and joking, yet Bran could tell that something was troubling his brother underneath the smile.-----------------
</p></origin><translate id="div_3355" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我很想跟你赛跑，怕只怕赢不了你。”罗柏的口气虽然轻快，带着戏谑的意味，但在哥哥的笑容背后，布兰却看得出他有心事。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3356');"><p>"I don’t want to race." Bran looked around for the direwolves. Both had vanished into the wood. "Did you hear Summer howling last night?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3356" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不想跟你比赛。”布兰四处张望，寻找冰原狼的踪影。但那两只狼早就消失在了森林里。 “昨晚你听见夏天叫了吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3357');"><p>"Grey Wind was restless too," Robb said. His auburn hair had grown shaggy and unkempt, and a reddish stubble covered his jaw, making him look older than his fifteen years. "Sometimes I think they know things?.?.?.?sense things?.?.?.?" Robb sighed. "I never know how much to tell you, Bran. I wish you were older."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3357" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“灰风也是焦躁不安。”罗柏道。他红棕色的头发长长了，未经梳理，有些凌乱，几撮红胡子遮住了下巴，让他看起来比十五岁的实际年龄要成熟。“有时候我觉得他们知道很多事……感应到很多事……”罗柏叹口气，“布兰，我不知该跟你说多少，我真希望你年纪再大一点。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3358');"><p>"I’m eight now!" Bran said. "Eight isn’t so much younger than fifteen, and I’m the heir to Winterfell, after you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3358" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我已经八岁了!”布兰说：“八岁和十五岁没差多少，而且在你之后，我也是临冬城的继承人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3359');"><p>"So you are." Robb sounded sad, and even a little scared. "Bran, I need to tell you something. There was a bird last night. From King’s Landing. Maester Luwin woke me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3359" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是啊，”罗柏语气哀伤，甚至有些害怕。“布兰，有件事我必须跟你讲清楚。昨晚来了只信鸦，从君临来，鲁温师傅半夜把我叫醒。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3360');"><p>Bran felt a sudden dread. Dark wings, dark words, Old Nan always said, and of late the messenger ravens had been proving the truth of the proverb. When Robb wrote to the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, the bird that came back brought word that Uncle Benjen was still missing. Then a message had arrived from the Eyrie, from Mother, but that had not been good news either. She did not say when she meant to return, only that she had taken the Imp as prisoner. Bran had sort of liked the little man, yet the name Lannister sent cold fingers creeping up his spine. There was something about the Lannisters, something he ought to remember, but when he tried to think what, he felt dizzy and his stomach clenched hard as a stone. Robb spent most of that day locked behind closed doors with Maester Luwin, Theon Greyjoy, and Hallis Mollen. Afterward, riders were sent out on fast horses, carrying Robb’s commands throughout the north. Bran heard talk of Moat Cailin, the ancient stronghold the First Men had built at the top of the Neck. No one ever told him what was happening, yet he knew it was not good.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3360" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰突然感到一阵惊恐。黑色的翅膀，黑色的消息，老奶妈总这么说，而近来传递信息的渡鸦一再证明了这句俗谚的正确。罗柏写信给守夜人军团的司令官，鸟儿却带回班扬叔叔依旧下落不明的消息。接着鹰巢城有信传来，是母亲写的，可惜也并非好消息。她没说何时回来，只说小恶魔如今是她的犯人。布兰其实还挺喜欢那矮个子，但“兰尼斯特”这个姓氏却教他背脊发凉。有件和兰尼斯特有关的事，他应该记得，然而每次他试图回忆，便觉头晕目眩，腹痛如绞。那一天，罗柏整日把自己关在房里，和鲁温师傅、席恩•葛雷乔伊，以及哈里斯•莫兰共商对策。之后信使骑着快马，将罗柏的命令传辫北境。布兰依稀听到卡林湾这地名，那是先民在颈泽北端筑起的古老要塞。究竟发生了什么，没人告诉他，但肯定不是什么好事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3361');"><p>And now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. "Was the bird from Mother? Is she coming home?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3361" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这会儿竟又来了一只渡鸦，又带来新的消息。布兰强迫自己满怀希望。“是母亲送来的吗？她是不是要回家了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3362');"><p>"The message was from Alyn in King’s Landing. Jory Cassel is dead. And Wyl and Heward as well. Murdered by the Kingslayer." Robb lifted his face to the snow, and the flakes melted on his cheeks. "May the gods give them rest."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3362" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“信是埃林从君临写来的。乔里•凯索死了，还有韦尔和海华。他们惨死于弑君者之手。”罗柏仰头面对飘雪，雪片融化在他两颊。“愿天上诸神让他们安息。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3363');"><p>Bran did not know what to say. He felt as if he’d been punched. Jory had been captain of the household guard at Winterfell since before Bran was born. "They killed Jory?" He remembered all the times Jory had chased him over the roofs. He could picture him striding across the yard in mail and plate, or sitting at his accustomed place on the bench in the Great Hall, joking as he ate. "Why would anyone kill Jory?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3363" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰不知该说什么才好，只觉自己仿佛被狠揍了一拳。打布兰出生，乔里就是临冬城的侍卫队长。“他们杀了乔里？”他记得每一次乔里追着他在屋顶上奔跑的情景，他可以清楚地拼凑出他全副铠甲，大步走过广场的风光，或是坐在厅堂的老位子上，边吃边谈笑的模样。“为什么会有人要杀乔里？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3364');"><p>Robb shook his head numbly, the pain plain in his eyes. "I don’t know, and?.?.?.?Bran, that’s not the worst of it. Father was caught beneath a falling horse in the fight. Alyn says his leg was shattered, and?.?.?.?Maester Pycelle has given him the milk of the poppy, but they aren’t sure when?.?.?.?when he . . ." The sound of hoofbeats made him glance down the road, to where Theon and the others were coming up. "When he will wake," Robb finished. He laid his hand on the pommel of his sword then, and went on in the solemn voice of Robb the Lord. "Bran, I promise you, whatever might happen, I will not let this be forgotten."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3364" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏木然地摇头，眼里溢满悲痛。“我不知道。还有……布兰，这不是最糟的消息，父亲也在打斗中被摔倒的马压住，埃林说他的腿碎了……派席尔大学士已经给他喝了罂粟花奶，但他们不确定什么时候……什么时候他才……”听见身后的蹄声，他转头朝来路望去，席恩等人已经赶了上来。“他才会醒来。”罗柏把话说完，伸手按住剑柄，恢复了罗柏城主的庄严声调，“布兰，我向你保证，不管发生什么，这个仇我永不会忘。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3365');"><p>Something in his tone made Bran even more fearful. "What will you do?" he asked as Theon Greyjoy reined in beside them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3365" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的语气却更教布兰害怕。“那你打算怎么办？”他问。席恩•葛雷乔伊拉住缰绳，停在他们旁边。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3366');"><p>"Theon thinks I should call the banners," Robb said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3366" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“席恩认为我应该立刻召集封臣。”罗柏说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3367');"><p>"Blood for blood." For once Greyjoy did not smile. His lean, dark face had a hungry look to it, and black hair fell down across his eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3367" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“血债血还。”这次葛雷乔伊没有笑。他那张削瘦而黝黑的脸，有种饥渴的神色黑发垂下，遮住双眼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3368');"><p>"Only the lord can call the banners," Bran said as the snow drifted down around them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3368" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“惟有领主才能召集封臣。”布兰说，雪持续飘落在他们周围。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3369');"><p>"If your father dies," Theon said, "Robb will be Lord of Winterfell."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3369" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果令尊去世，”席恩道，“罗柏就是临冬城公爵。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3370');"><p>"He won’t die!" Bran screamed at him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3370" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他不会死！”布兰朝他尖叫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3371');"><p>Robb took his hand. "He won’t die, not Father," he said calmly. "Still?.?.?.?the honor of the north is in my hands now. When our lord father took his leave of us, he told me to be strong for you and for Rickon. I’m almost a man grown, Bran."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3371" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏握住他的手。“他不会死，父亲大人不会死。”他平静地说。“可是……如今北境的荣誉系于我手。父亲大人临行前曾对我说，为了你和瑞肯，我一定要坚强。布兰，我几乎是成年人了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3372');"><p>Bran shivered. "I wish Mother was back," he said miserably. He looked around for Maester Luwin; his donkey was visible in the far distance, trotting over a rise. "Does Maester Luwin say to call the banners too?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3372" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰颤抖不已。“母亲如果在就好了。”他可怜兮兮地说。他转头寻找鲁温师傅的身影，他的驴子在远处依稀可见，此刻正小跑步爬上缓丘。“鲁温师傅也认为应该征召诸侯吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3373');"><p>"The maester is timid as an old woman," said Theon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3373" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“师傅他和老女人一样，胆小着呢。”席恩道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3374');"><p>"Father always listened to his counsel," Bran reminded his brother. "Mother too."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3374" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“但父亲向来听从他的忠告，”布兰提醒哥哥，“母亲也是。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3375');"><p>"I listen to him," Robb insisted. "I listen to everyone."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3375" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我也听，”罗柏坚持，“每个人的意见我都听。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3376');"><p>The joy Bran had felt at the ride was gone, melted away like the snowflakes on his face. Not so long ago, the thought of Robb calling the banners and riding off to war would have filled him with excitement, but now he felt only dread. "Can we go back now?" he asked. "I’m cold."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3376" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰外出骑马的喜悦，此刻已经消失得无影无踪，像脸上的雪片般融化殆尽。若是从前，听到罗柏要召集封臣，率军出征，他一定会兴奋难耐，然而现在他感到的却只有恐惧。“我们可以回去了吗？”他问，“我觉得好冷。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3377');"><p>Robb glanced around. "We need to find the wolves. Can you stand to go a bit longer?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3377" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏环顾四周。“得先把狼找到。你能再忍耐一会儿吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3378');"><p>"I can go as long as you can." Maester Luwin had warned him to keep the ride short, for fear of saddle sores, but Bran would not admit to weakness in front of his brother. He was sick of the way everyone was always fussing over him and asking how he was.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3378" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你能骑多久，我就能骑多久。”鲁温师傅曾警告他骑马时间不要太长，惟恐他在马鞍上坐久了全身会酸痛，但布兰不愿在哥哥面前自承虚弱。他受够了大家成天大惊小怪，对他的身体问长问短。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3379');"><p>"Let’s hunt down the hunters, then," Robb said. Side by side, they urged their mounts off the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood. Theon dropped back and followed well behind them, talking and joking with the guardsmen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3379" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那我们这就去把小猎人给猎回来吧。”罗柏说。于是他们并肩而行，驱策坐骑离开国王大道，进入狼林。席恩远远落在后面，和其他卫士谈笑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3380');"><p>It was nice under the trees. Bran kept Dancer to a walk, holding the reins lightly and looking all around him as they went. He knew this wood, but he had been so long confined to Winterfell that he felt as though he were seeing it for the first time. The smells filled his nostrils; the sharp fresh tang of pine needles, the earthy odor of wet rotting leaves, the hints of animal musk and distant cooking fires. He caught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered branches of an oak, and paused to study the silvery web of an empress spider.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3380" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>置身林间的感觉真好。布兰轻握马缰，让小舞缓步慢行，一边四处观望。他很熟悉这座森林，然而在长期坐困临冬城后，如今却有初次造访的兴味。树林里的气息充溢他的鼻孔：新鲜松针的明锐香气，湿软腐叶的泥土芬芳，还有模糊的动物麝香，以及远方炊烟的味道。他瞥见一只黑松鼠的身影，在一棵被雪覆盖的橡树枝干间穿梭，接着又驻足欣赏女王蛛所织就的银色蛛网。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3381');"><p>Theon and the others fell farther and farther behind, until Bran could no longer hear their voices. From ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters. It grew louder until they reached the stream. Tears stung his eyes.

The current foamed around rock and root, and Bran could feel the spray on his face as Robb led him over. It made him smile. For a moment he felt strong again, and whole. He looked up at the trees and dreamed of climbing them, right up to the very top, with the whole forest spread out beneath him.

Where it touched the ground it melted, but all about him rock and root and branch wore a thin blanket of white. As he waited, he was conscious of how uncomfortable he felt. He could not feel his legs, hanging useless in the stirrups, but the strap around his chest was tight and chafing, and the melting snow had soaked through his gloves to chill his hands. He wondered what was keeping Theon and Maester Luwin and Joseth and the rest.

His boots and gloves were lined with fur as well.

The man’s clothes were filthy, fallen almost to pieces, patched here with brown and here with blue and there with a dark green, and faded everywhere to grey, but once that cloak might have been black. The grey stubbly man wore black rags too, he saw with a sudden start. Suddenly Bran remembered the oathbreaker his father had beheaded, the day they had found the wolf pups; that man had worn black as well, and Father said he had been a deserter from the Night’s Watch. No man is more dangerous, he remembered Lord Eddard saying. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile or cruel.

Still half-grown, they were as large as any wolf he had ever seen, but the differences were easy to spot, if you knew what to look for. Maester Luwin and Farlen the kennelmaster had taught him. A direwolf had a bigger head and longer legs in proportion to its body, and its snout and jaw were markedly leaner and more pronounced. There was something gaunt and terrible about them as they stood there amid the gently falling snow. Fresh blood spotted Grey Wind’s muzzle.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3434');"><p>For a moment Stiv was at a loss. His hand trembled; Bran felt a trickle of blood where the knife pressed against his neck. The stench of the man filled his nose; he smelled of fear. "You," he called out to Robb. "You have a name?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3434" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>史帝夫似乎突然间没了主意。他的手开始发抖，布兰只觉得刀锋紧贴脖子，血顺着滴下来。男人的臭味充塞他鼻孔，那是一种恐惧的气息。“喂，”他朝罗柏喊，“你叫啥名字？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3435');"><p>"I am Robb Stark, the heir to Winterfell."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3439');"><p>Robb hesitated a moment. Then, slowly and deliberately, he dismounted and stood with his sword in hand.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3440');"><p>"Now kill the wolves."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3443');"><p>"No!" Bran screamed. If Robb did as they asked, Stiv would kill them both anyway, once the direwolves were dead.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3443" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不要!”布兰尖叫。就算罗柏照办，等冰原狼一死，史帝夫也不会放过他们俩。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3444');"><p>The bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly, till Bran sobbed in pain. "You shut your mouth, cripple, you hear me?" He twisted harder. "You hear me?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3444" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>光头用另一只手抓住他的头发，使劲狠狠地一扭，直到布兰痛得失声啜泣。“小废物，你给我闭嘴，听到了没？”他更用力地拧。“你听到了没？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3445');"><p>A low thrum came from the woods behind them. Stiv gave a choked gasp as a half foot of razor-tipped broadhead suddenly exploded out of his chest. The arrow was bright red, as if it had been painted in blood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3445" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>飕的一声，从背后的树林传来。史帝夫声音一紧，喘不过气来。只见一个半尺长，利如剃刀的宽大箭头突然自他胸膛爆出。那枝箭整个成了鲜红，沐浴在血中。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3446');"><p>The dagger fell away from Bran’s throat. The big man swayed and collapsed, facedown in the stream. The arrow broke beneath him. Bran watched his life go swirling off in the water.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3446" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰喉头的匕首松落，大汉晃了晃，面朝下倒在溪里。箭被他压断，布兰看着他的血淌进水中。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3447');"><p>Osha glanced around as Father’s guardsmen appeared from beneath the trees, steel in hand. She threw down her spear. "Mercy, m’lord," she called to Robb.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3447" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>欧莎四处张望；父亲的侍卫从树底下冒出来，手里都握着武器。她连忙抛下长枪。“大人饶命。”她朝罗柏叫道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3448');"><p>The guardsmen had a strange, pale look to their faces as they took in the scene of slaughter. They eyed the wolves uncertainly, and when Summer returned to Hali’s corpse to feed, Joseth dropped his knife and scrambled for the bush, heaving. Even Maester Luwin seemed shocked as he stepped from behind a tree, but only for an instant. Then he shook his head and waded across the stream to Bran’s side. "Are you hurt?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3448" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>见到眼前的屠杀景象，卫士们个个脸色苍白，神情怪异。他们犹豫地看着两只狼，而当夏天回去享用哈莉的尸体时，乔赛斯丢下猎刀，转身返回树丛边呕吐。就连鲁温师傅从林子里出来时，也是一脸惊骇。他随即恢复过来，摇摇头，舒水渡河到布兰身边。“你受伤了吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3449');"><p>"He cut my leg," Bran said, "but I couldn’t feel it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3449" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他砍伤了我的脚，”布兰说：“可我没感觉。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3450');"><p>As the maester knelt to examine the wound, Bran turned his head. Theon Greyjoy stood beside a sentinel tree, his bow in hand. He was smiling. Ever smiling. A half-dozen arrows were thrust into the soft ground at his feet, but it had taken only one. "A dead enemy is a thing of beauty," he announced.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3450" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老师傅弯身检视他的伤口，布兰别过头去，看见席恩•葛雷乔伊站在一棵哨兵树下，手里拿着弓，嘴上挂着笑。这家伙永远都在微笑。他脚边的软泥地上插了五六枝箭，但他只用了一枝。 “最好的敌人就是死掉的敌人。”他得意洋洋地表示。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3451');"><p>"Jon always said you were an ass, Greyjoy," Robb said loudly. "I ought to chain you up in the yard and let Bran take a few practice shots at you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3451" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“葛雷乔伊，琼恩老说你是个浑球。”罗柏朗声道，“我真该用铁链把你绑起来，放在场子里给布兰当箭靶。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3452');"><p>"You should be thanking me for saving your brother’s life."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3452" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你怎么不谢谢我救了你老弟的命？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3453');"><p>"What if you had missed the shot?" Robb said. "What if you’d only wounded him? What if you had made his hand jump, or hit Bran instead? For all you knew, the man might have been wearing a breastplate, all you could see was the back of his cloak. What would have happened to my brother then? Did you ever think of that, Greyjoy?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3453" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要是你没舐中怎么办？”罗柏道，“要是你没舐死他怎么办？要是你那一箭抖了他的手，或是命中布兰怎么办？你从后面只看得到他的斗篷，怎么知道他没穿胸甲？如果他真的穿了，那我弟弟会怎么样？葛雷乔伊，你有没有想过？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3454');"><p>Theon’s smile was gone. He gave a sullen shrug and began to pull his arrows from the ground, one by one.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3454" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>席恩的笑容消失了。他悻悻地耸肩，然后开始把箭一根根从地上拔起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3455');"><p>Robb glared at his guardsmen. "Where were you?" he demanded of them. "I was sure you were close behind us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3455" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏瞪着侍卫们。“你们跑哪儿去了？”他臼问，“我要你们紧跟在后。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3456');"><p>The men traded unhappy glances. "We were following, m’lord," said Quent, the youngest of them, his beard a soft brown fuzz. "Only first we waited for Maester Luwin and his ass, begging your pardons, and then, well, as it were?.?.?.?" He glanced over at Theon and quickly looked away, abashed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3456" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>守卫们交换着闷闷不乐的眼神。“大人，我们是跟在后面。”里面年纪最轻，长了棕色细胡的昆特说，“可我们要等鲁温师傅和他的驴，请大人原谅，然后，这个嘛，就是……”他瞄了席恩一眼，随即尴尬地别开头。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3457');"><p>"I spied a turkey," Theon said, annoyed by the question. "How was I to know that you’d leave the boy alone?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3457" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我在路上看到只火鸡，”席恩气恼地说，“我哪知道你会丢下小鬼不管？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3458');"><p>Robb turned his head to look at Theon once more. Bran had never seen him so angry, yet he said nothing. Finally he knelt beside Maester Luwin. "How badly is my brother wounded?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3458" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏再度转头瞪看席恩。布兰从未见他这么生气过，但他没有多说，只在鲁温师傅身旁蹲下来。“我弟弟的伤势如何？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3459');"><p>"No more than a scratch," the maester said. He wet a cloth in the stream to clean the cut. "Two of them wear the black," he told Robb as he worked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3459" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“破了点皮罢了。”老学士说。他把一块布在溪里浸湿，用来清洗伤口。“有两个人穿着黑衫军的衣服。”他边弄边告诉罗柏。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3460');"><p>Robb glanced over at where Stiv lay sprawled in the stream, his ragged black cloak moving fitfully as the rushing waters tugged at it. "Deserters from the Night’s Watch," he said grimly. "They must have been fools, to come so close to Winterfell."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3460" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏转头望向倒卧溪中的史帝夫，溪流不断拉扯着他破烂的黑斗篷。“守夜人军团的逃兵，”他口气严峻地说，“他们一定是没脑子，才会跑到离临冬城这么近的地方来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3461');"><p>"Folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart," said Maester Luwin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3461" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“由愚蠢或绝望所生的行为，彼此常常难以区分。”鲁温师傅道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3462');"><p>"Shall we bury them, m’lord?" asked Quent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3462" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，我们要埋葬他们吗？”昆特间。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3463');"><p>"They would not have buried us," Robb said. "Hack off their heads, we’ll send them back to the Wall. Leave the rest for the carrion crows."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3463" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们可不打算为我们安葬。”罗柏说，“把头砍下，送到长城。剩下的就留给乌鸦。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3464');"><p>"And this one?" Quent jerked a thumb toward Osha.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3464" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那她呢？”昆特用拇指指了指欧莎。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3465');"><p>Robb walked over to her. She was a head taller than he was, but she dropped to her knees at his approach. "Give me my life, m’lord of Stark, and I am yours."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3465" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏朝她走去。她比罗柏足足高出一头，但见他过来，却连忙跪下。“史塔克大人，求您饶我一命，我的人是您的了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3466');"><p>"Mine? What would I do with an oathbreaker?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3466" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的人？我要个背誓者做什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3467');"><p>"I broke no oaths. Stiv and Wallen flew down off the Wall, not me. The black crows got no place for women."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3467" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我没有背弃誓约。从长城逃出来的是史帝夫和华伦，不是我。那群黑乌鸦不收女人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3468');"><p>Theon Greyjoy sauntered closer. "Give her to the wolves," he urged Robb. The woman’s eyes went to what was left of Hali, and just as quickly away. She shuddered. Even the guardsmen looked queasy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3468" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>席恩•葛雷乔伊慢悠悠地晃过来。“拿她喂狼。”他怂恿罗柏。女人的视线望向哈莉的残骸，赶紧颤抖着转开。那景象连侍卫们看了也直想吐。

</p></origin><translate id="div_3469" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她是个女的。”罗柏说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3470');"><p>"A wildling," Bran told him. "She said they should keep me alive so they could take me to Mance Rayder."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3470" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“也是个野人。”布兰告诉他，“是她叫他们留我活口，好把我交给曼斯•雷德的。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3473');"><p>Maester Luwin stood. "We might do well to question her."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3473" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温师傅站起来。“盘问一番比较稳妥。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3474');"><p>Bran could see the relief on his brother’s face. "As you say, Maester. Wayn, bind her hands. She’ll come back to Winterfell with us?.?.?.?and live or die by the truths she gives us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3474" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰看见哥哥脸上如释重负的表情。“那就这样罢，师傅。韦恩，把她的手捆起来。她跟我们一起回临冬城……是生是死，就得由她的话来决定了。”
