</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_327');"><p>THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_327" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊斯班袅拉号停泊在一段水程以外，因此，我们从许多其他船只船头雕饰的下面过去，或是绕过它们的船尾。她们的缆绳有时在我们的平底船下擦过，有时则在我们的上方摇曳。尽管如此，我们最终还是靠到了大船的旁边。在我们上船之后，我们遇到了大副埃罗先生，并且接受了他的敬礼。他是个棕色皮肤的老水手，耳朵上戴着耳环，一只眼睛斜脱。他和乡绅的交情非常深厚和友好，但是我很快就察觉到，在特里罗尼和船长之间，情况并不是这样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_328');"><p>This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_328" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>后者是个目光锐利的人，似乎与船上的每个人都有气，很快他就向我们说明了原因，因为我们刚刚下到舱内，一个水手便跟进来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_329');"><p>"Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you," said he. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_329" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“阁下，斯莫列特船长要求同您谈话。”他说道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_330');"><p>"I am always at the captain's orders. Show him in," said the squire. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_330" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我随时听从船长的命令。让他进来。”乡绅说道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_331');"><p>The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and shut the door behind him. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_331" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>船长紧随在他的听差的后面，立刻就走进来，把门关在了身后。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_332');"><p>"Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all shipshape and seaworthy?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_332" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好吧，斯莫列特船长，你想说什么？我希望一切顺利，一切准备得井井有条，能经得起风浪。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_333');"><p>`Well, sir,' said the captain, `better speak plain, I believe, even at the risk of offence. I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet.'
</p></origin><translate id="div_333" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，阁下，”船长说道，“我相信开门见山会好一点，即使冒触犯您的危险。我不喜欢这次航行；我不喜欢这些水手；而且我也不喜欢我的同僚。简明扼要，就这些。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_334');"><p>"Perhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?" inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_334" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“也许，先生，你还不喜欢这艘船？”乡绅追问道，就像我看出的那样，勃然大怒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_335');"><p>"I can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried," said the captain. "She seems a clever craft; more I can't say." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_335" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“阁下，我不能那样说，因为她还没有试航，”船长说道。“她看上去是艘灵巧的船；更多的我就不能讲了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_336');"><p>"Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?" says the squire. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_336" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可能，先生，你也不喜欢你的雇主吧？”乡绅说道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_337');"><p>But here Dr. Livesey cut in. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_337" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但是这会儿利弗西医生插了进来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_338');"><p>"Stay a bit," said he, "stay a bit. No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too little, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words. You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_338" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“停一下，”他说，“停一下。这样的问题除了伤害感情外毫无用途。船长是说得太多了，或者他说得还远不够，而我必须要求他解释一下他的话。你说你不喜欢这次航行，那，是为什么呢？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_339');"><p>"I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me," said the captain. "So far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_339" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“先生，我是被我们称为密封的命令任命的，要将这艘船开到这位先生命令我开到的地方，”船长说，“到目前为止，一切顺利。但是现在我发现桅杆前的每个人知道的都比我多。我不能说这是好事，你们认为呢？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_340');"><p>"No," said Dr. Livesey, "I don't." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_340" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是这样，”利弗西医生说，“我也不认为这是好事。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_341');"><p>"Next," said the captain, "I learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_341" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“其次，”船长说道，“我知道我们是要出去寻宝——提醒你们，这是从我的手下人那里听到的。然而，寻宝是项小心翼翼的工作；我决不喜欢寻宝的航行；我不喜欢它们，尤其当它们还是秘密的时候，而（请你原谅，特里罗尼先生）这个秘密却告诉给了鹦鹉。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_342');"><p>"Silver's parrot?" asked the squire. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_342" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“西尔弗的鹦鹉？”乡绅问道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_343');"><p>"It's a way of speaking," said the captain. "Blabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_343" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是个说法，”船长说道，“我指的是泄密。我相信你们这些先生们自己也不知道在干些什么，但我告诉你们，我是怎么看的——不是活着就是送命，生死差之毫厘。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_344');"><p>"That is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough," replied Dr. Livesey. "We take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe us. Next, you say you don't like the crew. Are they not good seamen?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_344" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那是明摆着的，而且我敢说，千真万确，”利弗西医生答道。“我们是要冒这个险，但是我们没像你认为的那么大意。其次，你说你不喜欢这些水手。难道他们不是好水手吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_345');"><p>"I don't like them, sir," returned Captain Smollett. "And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_345" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不喜欢他们，先生，”斯莫列特船长回答道，“既然你提及此事，我认为我本来有权自己挑选手下人的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_346');"><p>"Perhaps you should," replied the doctor. "My friend should, perhaps, have taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was unintentional. And you don't like Mr. Arrow?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_346" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可能如此，”医生答道，“也许我的朋友本应当带上你的，但是，这如果算是个疏忽的话，决不是故意的。你不喜欢埃罗先生吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_347');"><p>"I don't, sir. I believe he's a good seaman, but he's too free with the crew to be a good officer. A mate should keep himself to himself--shouldn't drink with the men before the mast!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_347" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不这样认为，先生。我相信他是个好水手，但是他和船员们太随便了，当不了个好长官。一个大副必须树立大副的形象——不能在桅杆前和手下人一起酗酒！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_348');"><p>"Do you mean he drinks?" cried the squire. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_348" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说他酗酒？”乡绅叫道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_349');"><p>"No, sir," replied the captain, "only that he's too familiar." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_349" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，阁下，”船长答道，“只是他太不拘礼了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_350');"><p>"Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?" asked the doctor. "Tell us what you want." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_350" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好啦，总之就这么回事吧，船长？”医生问道。“告诉我们你想怎样。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_351');"><p>"Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_351" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，先生们，你们决定进行此次航行？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_352');"><p>"Like iron," answered the squire. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_352" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“铁了心了。”乡绅答道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_353');"><p>"Very good," said the captain. "Then, as you've heard me very patiently, saying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more. They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good place under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then, you are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin?--second point." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_353" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“很好，”船长说，“既然你们已经如此耐心地听我说了这么些无法证实的事，那么不妨再听我说几句。他们把火药和武器放到了前舱，而你们在特舱下面有个好地方，为什么不把它们放在那里？——此其一。还有，你们带了四个你们自己的人，而他们告诉我，这四人中有的被安置到了前舱。为什么不把他们的铺位安置到特舱这边来？——此其二。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_354');"><p>"Any more?" asked Mr. Trelawney. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_354" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还有要说的吗？”特里罗尼问道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_355');"><p>"One more," said the captain. "There's been too much blabbing already." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_355" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还有一点，”船长说道，“事情已经泄露得太多了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_356');"><p>"Far too much," agreed the doctor. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_356" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“实在是太多了。”医生附和道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_357');"><p>"I'll tell you what I've heard myself," continued Captain Smollett: "that you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--" And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_357" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我告诉你们我本人都听到了些什么，”斯莫列特船长继续说道，“你们有一张小岛的地图，在地图上有十字记号标明宝藏的位置，而那个小岛位于——”接着，他准确地报出了纬度和经度。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_358');"><p>"I never told that," cried the squire, "to a soul!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_358" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我从未跟人说过那个，”乡绅叫道，“连个鬼也没有！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_359');"><p>"The hands know it, sir," returned the captain. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_359" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“手下人知道那个，阁下。”船长答道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_360');"><p>"Livesey, that must have been you or Hawkins," cried the squire. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_360" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“利弗西，那肯定就是你或是霍金斯的事了。”乡绅叫道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_361');"><p>"It doesn't much matter who it was," replied the doctor. And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_361" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是谁关系不大。”医生答道。我看得出，医生和船长都不大在意特里罗尼先生的抗议，我也如此，的确，他的口风太松了；然而在这种情况下，我相信他说的是实话，没有人讲过那个岛的位置。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_362');"><p>"Well, gentlemen," continued the captain, "I don't know who has this map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_362" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好啦，先生们，”船长继续说道，“我不知道谁有这张地图，但是我指出一点，它对我和埃罗先生来说必须保密。不然的话，我请求你们允许我辞职。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_363');"><p>"I see," said the doctor. "You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other words, you fear a mutiny." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_363" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我明白，”医生说，“你希望我们暗中进行，并且在船的尾部用我朋友自己的人建立一支警备力量，占据船上的武器和火药。换言之，你怕发生一场哗变。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_364');"><p>"Sir," said Captain Smollett, "with no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. As for Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the same; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible for the ship's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her. I see things going, as I think, not quite right. And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth. And that's all." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_364" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“阁下，”斯莫列特船长说道，“我无意冒犯谁，因此拒绝你把这些话安到我身上。阁下，若是有哪个船长在掌握了确凿的证据的情况下，讲了那番话，再去出海，那可太离谱了。至于埃罗先生，我相信他完全是个忠实的人，其他人中的一些也是；也许所有的人都是如此。但是，我要对这艘船的安全和船上每个人的生命负责。我看到事情发展得，在我看来，不很对头。因此，我要求你们采取一定的预防措施，否则准我辞职。就这些。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_365');"><p>"Captain Smollett," began the doctor with a smile, "did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse? You'll excuse me, I dare say, but you remind me of that fable. When you came in here, I'll stake my wig, you meant more than this." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_365" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“斯莫列特船长，”医生开始微笑着说道，“你是否曾经听过大山和小耗子的寓言①？我敢说，你得原谅我，但是你使我想起了那个寓言。当你一走进这里，我敢拿我的假发打赌，你想说的不只这些。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_366');"><p>"Doctor," said the captain, "you are smart. When I came in here I meant to get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_366" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“医生，”船长说，“你很聪明。当我走进来的时候，我是准备被解雇的。我没指望特里罗尼先生会听进一个字。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_367');"><p>"No more I would," cried the squire. "Had Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce. As it is, I have heard you. I will do as you desire, but I think the worse of you." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_367" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“多一个字我也不想听了，”乡绅嚷道。“要不是利弗西医生在这里，我早就让你见鬼去了。既已如此，我就听你的。我会按照你的意思行事，但我并不真的信服你。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_368');"><p>"That's as you please, sir," said the captain. "You'll find I do my duty." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_368" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“悉听尊便，阁下，”船长说道，“你会发现我是尽职尽责的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_369');"><p>And with that he took his leave. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_369" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完他就离去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_370');"><p>"Trelawney," said the doctor, "contrary to all my notions, I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and John Silver." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_370" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“特里罗尼，”医生说道，“与我的估计完全相反，我相信你已设法弄到了两个忠实的人同你一道出海——这个人和约翰西尔弗。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_371');"><p>"Silver, if you like," cried the squire; "but as for that intolerable humbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly, unsailorly, and downright un-English." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_371" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“西尔弗，要是你愿意，”乡绅嚷道，“但是至于那个让人无法忍受的空话家，我敢断言，我认为他的行为是没有大丈夫气概的，没有水手气概的，并且彻头彻尾不像个英国人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_372');"><p>"Well," says the doctor, "we shall see." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_372" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好啦，”医生说，“我们拭目以待。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_373');"><p>When we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_373" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当我们来到甲板上时，人们已经开始往外搬武器和火药了，干活时一边还吆喝着，而船长和埃罗先生则站在一旁指挥。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_374');"><p>The new arrangement was quite to my liking. The whole schooner had been overhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side. It had been originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the doctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths. Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round-house. Very low it was still, of course; but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful as to the crew, but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had not long the benefit of his opinion. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_374" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>新的安排很合我意。整个帆船都翻腾起来，有六个原先在主舱房后部的铺位被移到了船尾；而这套舱房只通过舷窗旁的一条木板做的两道与厨房和前甲板相连。起初安排的是船长、埃罗先生、亨特、乔埃斯、医生和乡绅，占用这六个铺位。现在，我和雷卓斯加了起来，埃罗先生和船长就睡在舱梯旁的甲板上。那块地方已经从两侧加宽了，你几乎可以把它叫做一个后甲板舱。当然它还是很低矮，不过足够挂两个吊床了，看来大副对这种安排也十分的满意。即使是他，可能对船员们也有所怀疑，但这只是一种猜测；因为，就像你将要听到的，不久我们对他的看法便得到了反馈。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_375');"><p>We were all hard at work, changing the powder and the berths, when the last man or two, and Long John along with them, came off in a shore-boat. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_375" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当高个子约翰和最后的一两个人划着岸上的小划子过来时，我们全都在努力地工作着，搬运火药以及挪动铺位。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_376');"><p>The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and as soon as he saw what was doing, "So ho, mates!" says he. "What's this?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_376" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>厨子像猴子般灵巧地越过了船舷，一看到正在进行的工作便开口了，“怎么，伙计们！这是做什么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_377');"><p>"We're a-changing of the powder, Jack," answers one. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_377" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们正在搬运火药，杰克。”一个答道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_378');"><p>"Why, by the powers," cried Long John, "if we do, we'll miss the morning tide!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_378" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“噢，老天，”高个子约翰嚷道，“要是我们这么干下去，会错过早潮的！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_379');"><p>"My orders!" said the captain shortly. "You may go below, my man. Hands will want supper." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_379" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的命令！”船长简短地说道，“你可以到下面去了，船员们要吃晚饭了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_380');"><p>"Aye, aye, sir," answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_380" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“呃，呃，阁下。”厨子应着，摸了摸额发，立刻就消失在厨房那头了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_381');"><p>"That's a good man, captain," said the doctor. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_381" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那是个好人，船长。”医生说道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_382');"><p>"Very likely, sir," replied Captain Smollett. "Easy with that, men--easy," he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships, a long brass nine, "Here you, ship's boy," he cried, "out o' that! Off with you to the cook and get some work." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_382" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“很像是那么回事，先生，”斯莫列特船长答道。“别急，伙计们——慢慢来，”他不住地向正在抬火药的弟兄们说着，接着，他猛然注意到我正在察看我们搬到船中部来的那座旋转炮——一支黄铜的长“雪茄”。“过来，你，侍应生，”他叫道，“离那儿远点！到厨子那里找些活干。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_383');"><p>And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the doctor, "I'll have no favourites on my ship." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_383" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接下来，当我跑开的时候，我听见他很大声地对医生说：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_384');"><p>I assure you I was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the captain deeply. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_384" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的船上不允许有受宠的人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_385');"><p>10

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_387');"><p>ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place, and boatfuls of the squire's friends, Mr. Blandly and the like, coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I might have been twice as weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and interesting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle, the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_387" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那晚，我们通宵奔忙着，将物品装舱归位。同时，乡绅的朋友们，像布兰德利他们，一划子一划子地到大船上来祝他一帆风顺，平安返航。我在“本葆海军上将”旅店一个晚上干的活儿，远不及在这个晚上干的一半多。将近黎明时分，当水手长吹响了他的哨子，全体船员都站在绞盘杠前整齐待命时，我已经疲惫不堪了。我原本是双倍的疲惫了，却还总是舍不得离开甲板；对我来说，简短的命令，尖利的哨声，以及人们在船上桅灯微弱的光下熙熙攘攘地上岗的情景——所有这一切都是那么的新鲜有趣。

</p></origin><translate id="div_388" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂，‘大叉烧’，给我们起个头儿。”一个声音喊道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_389');"><p>"The old one," cried another. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_389" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“来个老调。”另一个喊道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_390');"><p>"Aye, aye, mates," said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch under his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well: 
</p></origin><translate id="div_390" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是，是，伙计们。”高个子约翰应道，他正胳膊底下架着拐，站在一旁。然后他立刻冲天唱出对我来说是那么熟悉的歌来—— 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_391');"><p>"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest--" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_391" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>十五个汉子扒上了死人胸——
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_392');"><p>And then the whole crew bore chorus:-- 
</p></origin><translate id="div_392" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，全体船员跟着合唱起来：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_393');"><p>"Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_393" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哟——嗬——嗬，再来郎姆酒一大瓶！
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_394');"><p>And at the third "Ho!" drove the bars before them with a will. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_394" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在第三声“嗬”出口时，他们一齐推动了面前的绞盘杠。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_395');"><p>Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_395" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>即使在那最激动人心的一刻，我也立刻回想起“本葆海军上将”旅店来；我似乎在那合唱里听到了船长的声音。但很快船就起锚了，挂在船头上滴着水；很快又开始张帆了，接着陆地和船舶从两边掠过；还没等我抓时间舒舒服服地躺下来睡一小时的觉，伊斯班袅拉号已经开始了她驶向宝岛的航程。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_396');"><p>I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened which require to be known. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_396" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我不准备详细叙述这次航行了。那是相当的顺利，船被证明是艘好船，水手都是有能力的水手，而船长则完全精通他的业务。但是在我们到达宝岛之前，发生了两三件事，需要讲清楚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_397');"><p>Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_397" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>首先是埃罗先生，他结果比船长早先担心的还要糟糕。他在人们中间没有威信，人们在他面前随心所欲。但那决不是最坏的；因为出海一两天后，他便开始带着迷糊的眼神、发红的面孔、结巴的舌头，以及其他酗酒的迹象出现在甲板上。一次又一次，他丢人地被喝令回到舱里去。有时他跌倒并划伤了自己，有时他整天躺在后甲板室他小小的铺位上；有时他差不多清醒过来时，也勉勉强强地干一两天。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_398');"><p>In the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink. That was the ship's mystery. Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_398" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>与此同时，我们怎么也搞不懂他从哪儿弄来的酒。那是船上的一个谜。我们尽可能地监视他，还是揭不开这个谜；当我们当面质问他时，要是他喝了酒，就只是笑，要是他还清醒，就否认除了水外还喝过其他任何东西。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_399');"><p>He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark night, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_399" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他不仅是个在船员们中间起不良影响的无用的官长，而且很显然，若按这个情形发展下去，他一定会很快结果掉自己的。因此，在一个漆黑的夜晚，当他一头栽到海里，完全消失、再也不见踪影时，没有人大惊讶或是格外难过。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_400');"><p>"Overboard!" said the captain. "Well, gentlemen, that saves the trouble of putting him in irons." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_400" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“失足落水！”船长说，“好吧，先生们，那省下了给他上镣铐的麻烦。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_401');"><p>But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to advance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_401" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但是这样我们就没有了大副；当然，有必要从下边的人中提拔一个。水手长乔布安德森是船上最有希望的人选，尽管他保持了原有的头衔，他却履行了大副的职责。特里罗尼先生是航过海的，他的知识使他成了个有用的人物，因为在好的天气里，他经常亲自值班。而舵手伊斯莱尔汉兹，是个细心的、足智多谋的、老练的。经验丰富的水手，在紧要时刻，几乎任何事情都可以放心地交给他做。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_402');"><p>He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men called him. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_402" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他是高个子约翰西尔弗的至交，因此一提到他的名字，就让我跟着说到我们船的厨子，“大叉烧”，人们那样称呼他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_403');"><p>Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces--Long John's earrings, they were called; and he would hand himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_403" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在船上，他用一根短索将他的拐杖和脖子套到一起，以使双手尽可能地自由。这是很可一看的：他把拐杖的脚嵌人到舱壁的缝中，抵靠着它，以适应船的每一次颠簸，像人在岸上一样稳当地干着他的烹饪工作。更令人称奇的是看他在最恶劣的天气跨过甲板。他装配了一两根绳索来帮助他跨过那最宽的地方——它们被称作“高个子约翰的耳环”；他使自己从一个地方转到另一个地方，一会儿使用那根拐杖，一会儿拉着短索就到了舷侧，就像能行走的人一样迅速。然而，以前和他一起航行过的人看到他这个样子都表露出惋惜之情。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_404');"><p>"He's no common man, Barbecue," said the coxswain to me. "He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded; and brave--a lion's nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together--him unarmed." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_404" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“‘大叉烧’，他是个不同寻常的人，”舵手对我说。“他在年轻的时候受过很好的教育，经心的时候能讲书上的字眼；而且他勇敢——一头狮子在高个子约翰身旁算不得什么！我看到他跟四个人格斗，把他们的头撞到一块儿——他赤手空拳。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_405');"><p>All the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service. To me he was unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_405" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>所有的船员都尊敬他，甚至服从他。他有办法和每个人都谈得来，并且能为每个人做特殊服务。他对我一向很好，总是很高兴在厨房里见到我，那个厨房被他收拾得非常的整洁；盘子被他擦得锃亮的悬挂起来，而他的鹦鹉则被关在角落里的一个笼子里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_406');"><p>"Come away, Hawkins," he would say; "come and have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the news. Here's Cap'n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint, after the famous buccaneer--here's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v'yage. Wasn't you, cap'n?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_406" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“下来啦，霍金斯，”他会这样说，“来听约翰讲个故事吧。没人比你更受欢迎了，我的孩子。你坐下来，听听新闻。这是‘弗林特船长’——我管我的鹦鹉叫‘弗林特船长’，照那有名的海盗起的名字——你瞧，‘弗林特船长’正预告我们航行的成功哩。是不是，船长？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_407');"><p>And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, "Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!" till you wondered that it was not out of breath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_407" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>而那只鹦鹉就会快嘴快舌地叫起来：“八个里亚尔！八个里亚尔！八个里亚尔！”让你为它的声嘶力竭而感到惊奇，直到约翰丢过去一方巾帕罩住笼子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_408');"><p>"Now, that bird," he would say, "is, maybe, two hundred years old, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody's seen more wickedness, it must be the devil himself. She's sailed with England, the great Cap'n England, the pirate. She's been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It's there she learned 'Pieces of eight,' and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em, Hawkins! She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa, she was; and to look at her you would think she was a babby. But you smelt powder--didn't you, cap'n?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_408" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“现在这只鸟，”他会这样说，“可能有两百岁了，霍金斯——它们多半长生不老，要是有谁见到的伤天害理事比它们多，那一定是魔鬼自己了。它曾经跟着殷格兰——伟大的殷格兰船长，那个海盗——一起出过海。它到达过马达加斯加，还有马拉巴，还有苏里南、普罗维登斯、坡托伯罗。打捞失事了的沉船时它也在场。就是在那儿，它学会了‘八个里亚尔’，没啥稀奇的；那儿沉了三十五万英里，霍金斯！当‘印度总督号’在果阿被强攻时，它也在场，它确实在的；而看到它时，你还会以为它是个雏鸟哩。但是你闻过火药味了——是不是，船长？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_409');"><p>"Stand by to go about," the parrot would scream. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_409" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“准备转向。”鹦鹉会这样尖叫道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_410');"><p>"Ah, she's a handsome craft, she is," the cook would say, and give her sugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. "There," John would add, "you can't touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. Here's this poor old innocent bird o' mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may lay to that. She would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before chaplain." And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_410" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，它是个漂亮的尤物，确实是的，”厨子会这样说，从他的口袋里拿糖给它，接着那鸟就啄着笼栅，一直咒骂下去，说出些让人难以置信的恶毒话。“你看，”约翰会补充说，“你不去碰沥青才不会被弄脏，孩子。我这只可怜的、无辜的老鸟骂人的本领炉火纯青，没有比它更聪明的了，你要明白这一点。在随营牧师面前，可以说，它也会这样骂哩。”说着，约翰会以他特有的庄严的神情掠一掠他的额发，这使我觉得他是船员中最好的一个。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_411');"><p>In the meantime, the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another. The squire made no bones about the matter; he despised the captain. The captain, on his part, never spoke but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a word wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a downright fancy to her. "She'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir. But," he would add, "all I say is, we're not home again, and I don't like the cruise." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_411" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在此期间，乡绅和斯莫列特船长的关系仍然是相当的疏远。这一点，乡绅毫无顾忌地表露了出来，他鄙视船长。而船长这方面呢，除非乡绅跟他说话，否则他决不先张口，而答话也是尖锐、简短、生硬的，不浪费一个字眼。当他被逼问得无路可走时，他也可能承认他错怪了船员们，他们中一些人就像他想要看到的那样有于劲，而阻所有的人都表现得相当好。至于这艘船，他是彻底地爱上了她。“她定会圆满地完成任务的，比一个男人有权期待他的发妻所做的还要好，阁下。不过，”他又补充道，“我说来说去，我们还是再难回家了，我不喜欢此次航行。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_412');"><p>The squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the deck, chin in air. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_412" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一听到这个，乡绅就会背过脸去，在甲板上走来走去，下巴翘上了天。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_413');"><p>"A trifle more of that man," he would say, "and I shall explode." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_413" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那个人再来那么一点的话，”他会说，“我就要气炸了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_414');"><p>We had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA. Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief there was never a ship's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea. Double grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days, as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man's birthday, and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_414" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我们遇到过些坏天气，而那只是证实了伊斯班袅拉号的质量。船上的每个人看来都很满足，否则他们一定就是不知足的人；因为，在我看来，自诺亚方舟下水以来，从未有哪只船的船员像他们那样被放纵。借点儿由子就要饮双倍的酒；不时地有肉馒头吃，比方乡绅听说那天是某人的生日；还有，总有一大桶苹果打开来放在船当腰的地方，谁爱吃就自己去拿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_415');"><p>"Never knew good come of it yet," the captain said to Dr. Livesey. "Spoil forecastle hands, make devils. That's my belief." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_415" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“从没听说这么做会带来什么好处，”船长对利弗西医生说。“放纵手下，招致灾难。这是我的信条。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_416');"><p>But good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had not been for that, we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_416" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但是那桶苹果确实带来了好处，就像你将要听到的那样：因为要是没有它，我们就不会得到警报，可能我们就会被叛逆之手统统于掉了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_417');"><p>This was how it came about. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_417" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>事情是这样发生的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_418');"><p>We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--I am not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night. It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation; some time that night, or at latest before noon of the morrow, we should sight the Treasure Island. We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea. The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray. All was drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_418" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我们赶到了贸易风①下，以便乘风抵达我们要去的岛——我不能说得更明白了——而我们现在正驶向它，由一个目力好的人日夜担任观望。照最长的估算，那大约是我们航程的最后一天；在那晚，或者说最迟在次日午时之前的某个时刻，我们就会看到宝岛了。我们的航向是西南，微风徐徐地吹着舷侧，海面平静无浪。伊斯班袅拉号翻卷着浪花稳定地推进着，不时升起又降下它的第一斜桅。所有的帆都鼓满了风；每个人都精神饱满，因为我们现在离探险第一阶段的末尾是那样地近了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_419');"><p>Now, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple. I ran on deck. The watch was all forward looking out for the island. The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_419" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当时，日头刚刚落下，我干完了所有的工作，正在往我的铺位走的路上，我忽然想吃一个苹果。我跑上了甲板，观望者正全神贯注在向前注视着岛屿的出现，掌舵的人正在看风使舵，一边自个儿轻轻地吹着口哨；除了海水拍打船头和船舷的咻咻声外，那就是惟一的声音了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_420');"><p>In I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an apple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak. It was Silver's voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_420" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我整个身子跳进了苹果桶，这才发现里面一个苹果也不剩了；但是，在黑暗中坐在里面，听着水声，伴着船身的上下起伏，我不觉打起盹来，或者说就快要睡着了，这时一个大个子扑通一声靠着桶坐下来。由于他的肩膀倚在桶上，桶摇晃起来，就在我想要跳起来的时候，这个人开始讲话了，是西尔弗的声音，还没等我听上几句，我就再不想暴露自己了，而只是蜷伏在里面，战战兢兢地听着，怀着极度的恐惧和好奇；就从这十来句话当中，我已明白，船上所有诚实的人的性命都系在我一人身上了。
