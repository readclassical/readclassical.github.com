</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1726');"><p>The Petite Duchesse was being rehearsed at the Varietes. The first act had just been carefully gone through, and the second was about to begin. Seated in old armchairs in front of the stage, Fauchery and Bordenave were discussing various points while the prompter, Father Cossard, a little humpbacked man perched on a straw-bottomed chair, was turning over the pages of the manuscript, a pencil between his lips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1726" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>游艺剧院里正在排演《小公爵夫人》，第一幕刚刚排演完毕，第二幕即将开始。福什利和博尔德纳夫坐在舞台口的旧扶手椅上，正在谈论剧中的问题。提台词的矮个子驼背老头科萨尔坐在一张草垫椅子上，嘴上咬住一支铅笔，在翻阅剧本手稿。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1727');"><p>"Well, what are they waiting for?" cried Bordenave on a sudden, tapping the floor savagely with his heavy cane. "Barillot, why don't they begin?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1727" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂，还等什么？”博尔德纳夫忽然嚷道，一边用他那粗大的手杖愤怒地敲着地板，“巴里约，为什么还不开始？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1728');"><p>"It's Monsieur Bosc that has disappeared," replied Barillot, who was acting as second stage manager.'
</p></origin><translate id="div_1728" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“博斯克先生不知到哪里去了，”巴里约回答道，“他是舞台副监督。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1729');"><p>Then there arose a tempest, and everybody shouted for Bosc while Bordenave swore.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1729" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这下可引起一场风波。大家都叫唤博斯克，博尔德纳夫破口骂道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1730');"><p>"Always the same thing, by God! It's all very well ringing for 'em: they're always where they've no business to be. And then they grumble when they're kept till after four o'clock."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1730" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他妈的！还是老样子。摇铃也没有用，他们老是到不该去的地方……可是，如果排演过了四点钟，他们就嘀嘀咕咕。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1731');"><p>But Bosc just then came in with supreme tranquillity.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1731" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时博斯克大摇大摆回来了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1732');"><p>"Eh? What? What do they want me for? Oh, it's my turn! You ought to have said so. All right! Simonne gives the cue: 'Here are the guests,' and I come in. Which way must I come in?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1732" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯？什么？要我干什么？啊！轮到我出场啦！早该告诉我一声嘛……好吧，西蒙娜说到末尾那句台词‘客人们来了。’ 我就上场……我该从哪儿上场呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1733');"><p>"Through the door, of course," cried Fauchery in great exasperation.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1733" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然是从门口上场喽。”福什利恼怒地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1734');"><p>"Yes, but where is the door?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1734" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对，但是门在哪儿呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1735');"><p>At this Bordenave fell upon Barillot and once more set to work swearing and hammering the boards with his cane.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1735" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这次，博尔德纳夫把火发泄到巴里约身上，他又骂起来，并用手杖猛敲地板，简直要把地板敲穿了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1736');"><p>"By God! I said a chair was to be put there to stand for the door, and every day we have to get it done again. Barillot! Where's Barillot? Another of 'em! Why, they're all going!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1736" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他妈的！我说过要放一张椅子表示门在那儿。每天都应该重新安排好……巴里约呢？巴里约在哪儿？又一个人不见了！他们全都溜啦！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1737');"><p>Nevertheless, Barillot came and planted the chair down in person, mutely weathering the storm as he did so. And the rehearsal began again. Simonne, in her hat and furs, began moving about like a maidservant busy arranging furniture. She paused to say:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1737" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>巴里约亲自搬一张椅子来，放到地板上，听到博尔德纳夫那暴风雨般的咒骂声，他驼着背，一声不吭。排演开始了。西蒙娜戴着帽子，身穿一件裘皮大衣，她摆出一副女仆的样子，正在收拾家具。她停下来说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1738');"><p>"I'm not warm, you know, so I keep my hands in my muff."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1738" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们知道，我并不感觉暖和，我要把手放在手笼里。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1739');"><p>Then changing her voice, she greeted Bosc with a little cry:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1739" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，她换了演戏的语气，轻轻叫了一声，欢迎博斯克：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1740');"><p>"La, it's Monsieur le Comte. You're the first to come, Monsieur le Comte, and Madame will be delighted."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1740" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“瞧！原来是伯爵先生。你是第一个到的，伯爵先生，太太一定会很高兴的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1741');"><p>Bosc had muddy trousers and a huge yellow overcoat, round the collar of which a tremendous comforter was wound. On his head he wore an old hat, and he kept his hands in his pockets. He did not act but dragged himself along, remarking in a hollow voice:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1741" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>博斯克穿着一条泥迹斑斑的裤子和一件宽大的黄色大衣，头戴一顶旧帽子，脖子上围着一条大围巾。他两只手插在口袋里，用拖得长长的低沉的声音一本正经地说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1742');"><p>"Don't disturb your mistress, Isabelle; I want to take her by surprise."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1742" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别惊动你的主人，伊莎贝尔；我想去吓吓她。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1743');"><p>The rehearsal took its course. Bordenave knitted his brows. He had slipped down low in his armchair and was listening with an air of fatigue. Fauchery was nervous and kept shifting about in his seat. Every few minutes he itched with the desire to interrupt, but he restrained himself. He heard a whispering in the dark and empty house behind him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1743" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>排演还在继续进行。博尔德纳夫面有愠色，把身子缩在椅子里，面带倦容地听着。福什利则烦躁不安，在椅子里不停地动着，心里时刻发痒，想打断排演，但还是忍耐住了。在他身后，大厅里黑魆魆、空荡荡的，他听见一阵窃窃私语声。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1744');"><p>"Is she there?" he asked, leaning over toward Bordenave.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1744" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她来了吗？”他侧着身子，问博尔德纳夫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1745');"><p>The latter nodded affirmatively. Before accepting the part of Geraldine, which he was offering her, Nana had been anxious to see the piece, for she hesitated to play a courtesan's part a second time. She, in fact, aspired to an honest woman's part. Accordingly she was hiding in the shadows of a corner box in company with Labordette, who was managing matters for her with Bordenave. Fauchery glanced in her direction and then once more set himself to follow the rehearsal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1745" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>博尔德纳夫只点头作答。他让娜娜演热拉尔迪娜这个角色，但是娜娜想先看看戏再说，因为她对是否还演荡妇，心里有点迟疑不决。她盼望扮演正经女人。她和拉博德特坐在楼下一个黑魆魆的包厢里；拉博德特尽量为她帮忙，在博尔德纳夫面前替她说情。福什利用目光寻找了她一下，马上又继续看排演。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1746');"><p>Only the front of the stage was lit up. A flaring gas burner on a support, which was fed by a pipe from the footlights, burned in front of a reflector and cast its full brightness over the immediate foreground. It looked like a big yellow eye glaring through the surrounding semiobscurity, where it flamed in a doubtful, melancholy way. Cossard was holding up his manuscript against the slender stem of this arrangement. He wanted to see more clearly, and in the flood of light his hump was sharply outlined. As to Bordenave and Fauchery, they were already drowned in shadow. It was only in the heart of this enormous structure, on a few square yards of stage, that a faint glow suggested the light cast by some lantern nailed up in a railway station. It made the actors look like eccentric phantoms and set their shadows dancing after them. The remainder of the stage was full of mist and suggested a house in process of being pulled down, a church nave in utter ruin. It was littered with ladders, with set pieces and with scenery, of which the faded painting suggested heaped-up rubbish. Hanging high in air, the scenes had the appearance of great ragged clouts suspended from the rafters of some vast old-clothes shop, while above these again a ray of bright sunlight fell from a window and clove the shadow round the flies with a bar of gold.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1746" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>全场只有舞台口的灯亮着。那里只有一盏小灯，是安装在脚灯分叉处的一个煤气灯头，它的光亮照在一面反射镜上，光亮全部反射到台口。煤气灯头的光焰在昏暗中，犹如一只睁大的黄色眼睛，无精打采地闪烁着。科萨尔把剧本手稿捧得高高的，身子贴近细长的灯杆，这样看得更清楚一些，他的背正好在灯光下，显得更加驼了。博尔德纳夫和福什利已经隐没在黑暗中。舞台犹如一艘硕大无朋的船只，那盏灯酷似挂在泊船站上的一根柱子上的风灯，微弱的灯光只照亮船中间方圆几米的一块地方。演员们在灯光下，像一个个怪模怪样的幻影，他们的身影在不停晃动着。舞台的其余部分是一片茫茫烟雾，颇像一片拆除建筑物的工地，也像一座倒塌了的教堂。梯子、架子、布景塞满地面，布景全都褪了色，就像一堆堆废弃物；挂在空中的布景，看上去像大估衣店里挂在屋梁上的破布。在空中布景的高处，一束阳光从窗户射进来，像一根金棒劈断舞台上空的黑暗。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1747');"><p>Meanwhile actors were chatting at the back of the stage while awaiting their cues. Little by little they had raised their voices.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1747" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在舞台后边，演员们一边闲聊，一边等待上场。他们讲话的声音渐渐大起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1748');"><p>"Confound it, will you be silent?" howled Bordenave, raging up and down in his chair. "I can't hear a word. Go outside if you want to talk; WE are at work. Barillot, if there's any more talking I clap on fines all round!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1748" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂，瞧你们这个样子，住嘴好吧！”博尔德纳夫从椅子上跳起来，大声吼道，“我一句话也听不见……你们要说话就滚出去说；我们这边正在有事……巴里约，如果还有人讲话，不管什么人，都要罚款！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1749');"><p>They were silent for a second or two. They were sitting in a little group on a bench and some rustic chairs in the corner of a scenic garden, which was standing ready to be put in position as it would be used in the opening act the same evening. In the middle of this group Fontan and Prulliere were listening to Rose Mignon, to whom the manager of the Folies-Dramatique Theatre had been making magnificent offers. But a voice was heard shouting:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1749" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>演员们安静了片刻。他们聚拢到一起，坐在一条长凳和几张简陋椅子上。那些椅凳是晚上演第一幕时的布景，要放在花园布景的一个角落上，现在正准备安放。丰唐和普律利埃尔在听罗丝米尼翁讲话，她说游乐剧院的经理刚刚表示愿以高额报酬聘请她。这时听见一个人喊道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1750');"><p>"The duchess! Saint-Firmin! The duchess and Saint-Firmin are wanted!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1750" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“公爵夫人！……圣菲尔曼！……公爵夫人和圣菲尔曼上场喽！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1751');"><p>Only when the call was repeated did Prulliere remember that he was Saint-Firmin! Rose, who was playing the Duchess Helene, was already waiting to go on with him while old Bosc slowly returned to his seat, dragging one foot after the other over the sonorous and deserted boards. Clarisse offered him a place on the bench beside her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1751" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>听到叫唤第二遍时，普律利埃尔才想起自己是演圣菲尔曼的，罗丝扮演公爵夫人埃莱娜，她正在等他一道上场。博斯克老头在空荡、发出响声的地板上慢慢地拖着脚步，走回台后。克拉利瑟见他来了，连忙给他让出半条长凳。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1752');"><p>"What's he bawling like that for?" she said in allusion to Bordenave. "Things will be getting rosy soon! A piece can't be put on nowadays without its getting on his nerves."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1752" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他为什么那样咆哮？”克拉利瑟问道，她说的是博尔德纳夫，“马上排演秩序就会好的……现在，不管排演哪出戏他都要发火。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1753');"><p>Bosc shrugged his shoulders; he was above such storms. Fontan whispered:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1753" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>博斯克耸耸肩膀，他是不管这些大吵大闹的。丰唐低声说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1754');"><p>"He's afraid of a fiasco. The piece strikes me as idiotic."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1754" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“因为他预感到这出戏要失败。我看这出戏差劲。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1755');"><p>Then he turned to Clarisse and again referred to what Rose had been telling them:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1755" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，他又对克拉利瑟说起罗丝的事： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1756');"><p>"D'you believe in the offers of the Folies people, eh? Three hundred francs an evening for a hundred nights! Why not a country house into the bargain? If his wife were to be given three hundred francs Mignon would chuck my friend Bordenave and do it jolly sharp too!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1756" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯？游乐剧院愿出大价钱，你相信吗？……每晚三百法郎，连演一百场，为什么不说还要送她一座乡间别墅呢！如果每晚真的付给米尼翁老婆三百法郎，他早就干净利落地把博尔德纳夫一脚踢开喽！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1757');"><p>Clarisse was a believer in the three hundred francs. That man Fontan was always picking holes in his friends' successes! Just then Simonne interrupted her. She was shivering with cold. Indeed, they were all buttoned up to the ears and had comforters on, and they looked up at the ray of sunlight which shone brightly above them but did not penetrate the cold gloom of the theater. In the streets outside there was a frost under a November sky.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1757" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>克拉利瑟相信每晚三百法郎是真的。这个丰唐总是喜欢在背后诽谤自己的同事！这时，西蒙娜打断了他俩的谈话。她冷得全身直打哆嗦。大家都把衣扣扣得紧紧的，脖子上还围着围巾，仰头望着空中闪烁的阳光，可是阳光却照不到阴暗、冷冰冰的舞台上。外边已经结冰了，已经是十一月份了，天空一片晴朗。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1758');"><p>"And there's no fire in the greenroom!" said Simonne. "It's disgusting; he IS just becoming a skinflint! I want to be off; I don't want to get seedy."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1758" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“休息室里没有生火！”西蒙娜说道，“真讨厌，他成了阿巴贡了！……我真想走，我不愿在这里冻出病来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1759');"><p>"Silence, I say!" Bordenave once more thundered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1759" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“安静！”博尔德纳夫又大声吼道，那吼声酷似雷声。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1760');"><p>Then for a minute or so a confused murmur alone was audible as the actors went on repeating their parts. There was scarcely any appropriate action, and they spoke in even tones so as not to tire themselves. Nevertheless, when they did emphasize a particular shade of meaning they cast a glance at the house, which lay before them like a yawning gulf. It was suffused with vague, ambient shadow, which resembled the fine dust floating pent in some high, windowless loft. The deserted house, whose sole illumination was the twilight radiance of the stage, seemed to slumber in melancholy and mysterious effacement. Near the ceiling dense night smothered the frescoes, while from the several tiers of stage boxes on either hand huge widths of gray canvas stretched down to protect the neighboring hangings. In fact, there was no end to these coverings; bands of canvas had been thrown over the velvet-covered ledges in front of the various galleries which they shrouded thickly. Their pale hue stained the surrounding shadows, and of the general decorations of the house only the dark recesses of the boxes were distinguishable. These served to outline the framework of the several stories, where the seats were so many stains of red velvet turned black. The chandelier had been let down as far as it would go, and it so filled the region of the stalls with its pendants as to suggest a flitting and to set one thinking that the public had started on a journey from which they would never return.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1760" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，有好几分钟时间，只听见演员们含糊不清地朗诵台词的声音。他们几乎不做动作，语调平直，尽量省点气力。然而，每当他们演到要引人注意的地方时，便举目向大厅里扫视几下。他们面前的大厅，像一个大洞，里面飘动着一片模糊的影子，也像一间没有窗户的高高的阁楼，里面飘着微尘。大厅里的灯全熄灭了，它仅被舞台上的若明若暗的灯光照亮，仿佛沉睡了，里面的一切看上去模糊不清，一派凄凉景象，令人不安。天花板上的画全都隐没在黑暗中。舞台左右两边的包厢，从上到下挂着大幅灰布，用来保护墙饰。一切东西都套上罩布，连栏杆上的丝绒套上都盖上罩布，整个楼座像裹上了双层裹尸布，罩布的灰白色与大厅里的一片黑暗显得很不协调。整个大厅里都是褪了色的色调，只能隐约看见凹陷进去的、光线暗淡的包厢，包厢构成了每一层楼的骨架，里面的坐椅像一个个黑点，坐椅上的大红丝绒看上去几乎是黑色。大吊灯完全放下来了，它的水晶坠子占据了全部正厅前座，这种景象令人联想到搬家，联想到观众出外旅行，他们再也不会回来了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1761');"><p>Just about then Rose, as the little duchess who has been misled into the society of a courtesan, came to the footlights, lifted up her hands and pouted adorably at the dark and empty theater, which was as sad as a house of mourning.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1761" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在这时候，由罗丝扮演的小公爵夫人，误入一个妓女家里，她向脚灯处走去。她举起双手，向着大厅撅起逗人的小嘴，空荡的大厅里一片漆黑，像灵堂里一样阴森。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1762');"><p>"Good heavens, what queer people!" she said, emphasizing the phrase and confident that it would have its effect.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1762" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的上帝！这个世界是多么奇怪啊！”她说这句话时，加重了语气，确信能在观众中产生良好的效果。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1763');"><p>Far back in the corner box in which she was hiding Nana sat enveloped in a great shawl. She was listening to the play and devouring Rose with her eyes. Turning toward Labordette, she asked him in a low tone:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1763" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜裹着一条宽大的披肩，躲在包厢里听着排演，两眼却盯住罗丝。她转过身子，悄声问拉博德特： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1764');"><p>"You are sure he'll come?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1764" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你能肯定他会来吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1765');"><p>"Quite sure. Without doubt he'll come with Mignon, so as to have an excuse for coming. As soon as he makes his appearance you'll go up into Mathilde's dressing room, and I'll bring him to you there."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1765" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“完全可以肯定。他可能跟米尼翁一起来，这样好有个借口……他一来时，你就到楼上马蒂尔德的化妆室里去，我把他带到那儿去见见你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1766');"><p>They were talking of Count Muffat. Labordette had arranged this interview with him on neutral ground. He had had a serious talk with Bordenave, whose affairs had been gravely damaged by two successive failures. Accordingly Bordenave had hastened to lend him his theater and to offer Nana a part, for he was anxious to win the count's favor and hoped to be able to borrow from him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1766" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们说的是缪法伯爵。这是由拉博德特安排的在第三者处的一次会面。这事他早已跟博尔德纳夫一本正经地说过了。博尔德纳夫已有两次演出失败，现在处境艰难。因此，他急于把剧院提供给他们，作为他们会面的场所，并让娜娜扮演一个角色，企图讨好伯爵，向他借一笔钱。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1767');"><p>"And this part of Geraldine, what d'you thing of it?" continued Labordette.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1767" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“热拉尔迪娜这个角色，你认为怎样？”拉博德特又说道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1768');"><p>But Nana sat motionless and vouchsafed no reply. After the first act, in which the author showed how the Duc de Beaurivage played his wife false with the blonde Geraldine, a comic-opera celebrity, the second act witnessed the Duchess Helene's arrival at the house of the actress on the occasion of a masked ball being given by the latter. The duchess has come to find out by what magical process ladies of that sort conquer and retain their husbands' affections. A cousin, the handsome Oscar de Saint-Firmin, introduces her and hopes to be able to debauch her. And her first lesson causes her great surprise, for she hears Geraldine swearing like a hodman at the duke, who suffers with most ecstatic submissiveness. The episode causes her to cry out, "Dear me, if that's the way one ought to talk to the men!" Geraldine had scarce any other scene in the act save this one. As to the duchess, she is very soon punished for her curiosity, for an old buck, the Baron de Tardiveau, takes her for a courtesan and becomes very gallant, while on her other side Beaurivage sits on a lounging chair and makes his peace with Geraldine by dint of kisses and caresses. As this last lady's part had not yet been assigned to anyone, Father Cossard had got up to read it, and he was now figuring away in Bosc's arms and emphasizing it despite himself. At this point, while the rehearsal was dragging monotonously on, Fauchery suddenly jumped from his chair. He had restrained himself up to that moment, but now his nerves got the better of him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1768" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但是，娜娜不动声色，没有回答他的问题。第一幕里，作者描写了德博里瓦热公爵欺骗他的妻子，与金发女郎、轻歌剧明星热拉尔迪娜通奸；在第二幕里，公爵夫人埃莱娜一天晚上来到女明星家里，想利用化装舞会的机会，了解这些太太究竟用什么妙计征服她们的丈夫，并把他们留在身边。带她来的是她的表兄、美男子奥斯卡德圣菲尔曼，他想诱使她堕落。她得到的第一个教训使她大为吃惊，她听到热拉尔迪娜像个泼妇，跟公爵大吵大闹，而公爵呢，却很温顺，以笑脸相待；公爵夫人不禁大声叫起来：“噢！对男人应该是这样讲话！”在第二幕里，热拉尔迪娜只在这场戏中出现。至于公爵夫人，她的好奇心立即受到了惩罚：老风流德塔迪沃男爵把她当成轻佻女人，狂热地追求她；而在另一边，博里瓦热坐在一张长椅子上，亲吻着热拉尔迪娜，与她言归于好了。因为这个角色排演时还没有人担任，就由科萨尔老头站起来念台词，他念着念着，根据自己的想象，不由自主地加进了自己的意思，他是倒在博斯克的怀里演这场戏的。整个排演拖拖拉拉，令人乏味，演到这里时，福什利霍地从椅子上站起来。他一直耐着性子，现在再也忍不住了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1769');"><p>"That's not it!" he cried.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1769" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“演得不对！”他叫道。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1772');"><p>"Nobody is! You're quite wrong, quite wrong!" continued Fauchery, and, gesticulating wildly, he came striding over the stage and began himself to act the scene.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1772" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有一个人演得对，根本不是这样，根本不是这样！”福什利补充道。他做起手势，大步走来走去，亲自表演起来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1773');"><p>"Now look here, you Fontan, do please comprehend the way Tardiveau gets packed off. You must lean forward like this in order to catch hold of the duchess. And then you, Rose, must change your position like that but not too soon—only when you hear the kiss."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1773" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂，丰唐，你应该知道塔迪沃这时很激动；你应该弯下身子，用这样的动作抓住公爵夫人……而你呢，罗丝，这时应当愣一下，猛然愣一下，像这样，但是不要愣得过早，要在听到接吻的声音时才……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1774');"><p>He broke off and in the heat of explanation shouted to Cossard:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1774" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>福什利解释得正起劲时，霍地停下来，对科萨尔大声说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1775');"><p>"Geraldine, give the kiss! Loudly, so that it may be heard!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1775" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“热拉尔迪娜，接吻吧……吻得响一些，让大家都听见！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1776');"><p>Father Cossard turned toward Bosc and smacked his lips vigorously.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1776" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>科萨尔老头向博斯克转过脸去，在他的嘴唇上猛亲一下。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1777');"><p>"Good! That's the kiss," said Fauchery triumphantly. "Once more; let's have it once more. Now you see, Rose, I've had time to move, and then I give a little cry—so: 'Oh, she's given him a kiss.' But before I do that, Tardiveau must go up the stage. D'you hear, Fontan? You go up. Come, let's try it again, all together."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1777" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“亲得好，这才是真正的接吻，”福什利得意洋洋地说，“再吻一次……看见没有，罗丝？我刚才走过时看见了，我轻轻地叫一声：‘啊！她吻他了。’不过，要练好这个动作，塔迪沃应当再上场一次……来吧！试试看，整个重来一次。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1778');"><p>The actors continued the scene again, but Fontan played his part with such an ill grace that they made no sort of progress. Twice Fauchery had to repeat his explanation, each time acting it out with more warmth than before. The actors listened to him with melancholy faces, gazed momentarily at one another, as though he had asked them to walk on their heads, and then awkwardly essayed the passage, only to pull up short directly afterward, looking as stiff as puppets whose strings have just been snapped.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1778" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>演员们重新排演这场戏。但是丰唐内心很不乐意，以致这场戏几乎排不下去。福什利不得不再重新指导两次，而且每次都表现出很大的热情。演员们都没精打采地听他讲，大家你瞧瞧我，我瞧瞧你，好像福什利要求他们低头走路似的；随后，他们刚笨拙地试演，马上又停下来，动作呆板得像断了线的木偶。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1779');"><p>"No, it beats me; I can't understand it," said Fontan at length, speaking in the insolent manner peculiar to him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1779" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不行，这对我来说太难了，我真不明白为什么要这样。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1780');"><p>Bordenave had never once opened his lips. He had slipped quite down in his armchair, so that only the top of his hat was now visible in the doubtful flicker of the gaslight on the stand. His cane had fallen from his grasp and lay slantwise across his waistcoat. Indeed, he seemed to be asleep. But suddenly he sat bolt upright.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1780" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丰唐终于用傲慢的口气说道。 博尔德纳夫没有开口。他把身子紧紧地缩在椅子里，在那盏小灯的昏暗光亮下，大家只看见他的帽顶，帽子卡在他的眼睛上，手杖从手上落了下来，横放在肚子上；大家真以为他睡着了。这时，他突然把身子坐直了，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1781');"><p>"It's idiotic, my boy," he announced quietly to Fauchery.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1781" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小伙计，你真愚蠢。”他心平气和地对福什利说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1782');"><p>"What d'you mean, idiotic?" cried the author, growing very pale. "It's you that are the idiot, my dear boy!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1782" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么！愚蠢！”作者脸色变得煞白，大声嚷道，“你自己才愚蠢呢，亲爱的！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1783');"><p>Bordenave began to get angry at once. He repeated the word "idiotic" and, seeking a more forcible expression, hit upon "imbecile" and "damned foolish." The public would hiss, and the act would never be finished! And when Fauchery, without, indeed, being very deeply wounded by these big phrases, which always recurred when a new piece was being put on, grew savage and called the other a brute, Bordenave went beyond all bounds, brandished his cane in the air, snorted like a bull and shouted:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1783" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>博尔德纳夫顿时勃然大怒。他又连说几次“愚蠢”，他在脑子里搜索比“愚蠢”两个字更加恶毒的字眼，找到了“低能”和“傻瓜”两个词来谩骂福什利。大家要起哄了，这样下去，这出戏是排演不到底的。他们每次排演一出新戏，这类粗话在他们之间是经常骂来骂去的，福什利并不觉得受到伤害，可是这一次他确实恼火了，他干脆骂博尔德纳夫是畜生。博尔德纳夫气得控制不住自己，把手杖抡得团团转，他像牛一样喘着气，嚷道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1784');"><p>"Good God! Why the hell can't you shut up? We've lost a quarter of an hour over this folly. Yes, folly! There's no sense in it. And it's so simple, after all's said and done! You, Fontan, mustn't move. You, Rose, must make your little movement, just that, no more; d'ye see? And then you come down. Now then, let's get it done this journey. Give the kiss, Cossard."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1784" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他妈的！让我安静点……你说了那么多蠢话，让我们白白浪费了一刻钟……你确实说了很多蠢话，你连常识都不懂……事实上，这是再简单不过的事！丰唐，你别动。罗丝，你稍微动一下，别动得厉害，你知道吧，然后你走下来……好了，这次就这样排吧。科萨尔，接吻吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1785');"><p>Then ensued confusion. The scene went no better than before. Bordenave, in his turn, showed them how to act it about as gracefully as an elephant might have done, while Fauchery sneered and shrugged pityingly. After that Fontan put his word in, and even Bosc made so bold as to give advice. Rose, thoroughly tired out, had ended by sitting down on the chair which indicated the door. No one knew where they had got to, and by way of finish to it all Simonne made a premature entry, under the impression that her cue had been given her, and arrived amid the confusion. This so enraged Bordenave that he whirled his stick round in a terrific manner and caught her a sounding thwack to the rearward. At rehearsal he used frequently to drub his former mistress. Simonne ran away, and this furious outcry followed her:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1785" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>结果排演得混乱不堪，并不比刚才排得好。这次轮到博尔德纳夫来做示范动作了。他像一头大象，却硬做出一副风度翩翩的样子，福什利耸耸肩膀，嘲笑他那副可怜的样子。接着，丰唐也来干预继续排演了，博斯克斗胆提了一些意见。罗丝精疲力竭，最后一下坐到代替门的椅子上。大家不知道排演到什么地方了，更糟糕的是，西蒙娜以为听见了该她接的尾白，过早地入了场，结果秩序一片混乱；这下可惹怒了博尔德纳夫，他把手杖抡得飞转，在西蒙娜的屁股上猛打一下。他经常与女演员睡过觉后，到排演时又打她们。西蒙娜逃走时，博尔德纳夫还气冲冲地喊道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1786');"><p>"Take that, and, by God, if I'm annoyed again I shut the whole shop up at once!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1786" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这一棍你就受着吧，他妈的！再有人来烦我，我就关闭这个破剧院！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1787');"><p>Fauchery pushed his hat down over his forehead and pretended to be going to leave the theater. But he stopped at the top of the stage and came down again when he saw Bordenave perspiringly resuming his seat. Then he, too, took up his old position in the other armchair. For some seconds they sat motionless side by side while oppressive silence reigned in the shadowy house. The actors waited for nearly two minutes. They were all heavy with exhaustion and felt as though they had performed an overwhelming task.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1787" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>福什利把帽子往头上一戴，装出马上要离开剧院的样子。他走下舞台，看见博尔德纳夫重新坐下来，浑身是汗。福什利在另一张椅子上坐下来。他们一动未动，并排坐了一会儿，黑暗的大厅里一片寂静。演员们等了约两分钟。每个人都疲惫不堪，仿佛刚刚干了一件繁重的活儿。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1788');"><p>"Well, let's go on," said Bordenave at last. He spoke in his usual voice and was perfectly calm.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1788" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好吧，咱们继续排演吧。”博尔德纳夫终于用正常的语调心平气静地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1789');"><p>"Yes, let's go on," Fauchery repeated. "We'll arrange the scene tomorrow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1789" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对，继续排下去。”福什利说，“这场戏明天再作调整。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1790');"><p>And with that they dragged on again and rehearsed their parts with as much listlessness and as fine an indifference as ever. During the dispute between manager and author Fontan and the rest had been taking things very comfortably on the rustic bench and seats at the back of the stage, where they had been chuckling, grumbling and saying fiercely cutting things. But when Simonne came back, still smarting from her blow and choking with sobs, they grew melodramatic and declared that had they been in her place they would have strangled the swine. She began wiping her eyes and nodding approval. It was all over between them, she said. She was leaving him, especially as Steiner had offered to give her a grand start in life only the day before. Clarisse was much astonished at this, for the banker was quite ruined, but Prulliere began laughing and reminded them of the neat manner in which that confounded Israelite had puffed himself alongside of Rose in order to get his Landes saltworks afloat on 'change. Just at that time he was airing a new project, namely, a tunnel under the Bosporus. Simonne listened with the greatest interest to this fresh piece of information.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1790" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们往椅子里一躺，演员们又无精打采、心不在焉地进行排演。刚才经理和剧作者争吵时，丰唐和其他演员快乐地坐在后面一条长凳上和几张简陋的椅子上。他们暗暗笑着，低声埋怨，还说些挖苦话。但是，当西蒙娜屁股上挨了一棍，泣不成声向后面走来时，他们变得严肃起来。他们说，如果他们是西蒙娜，就把那个猪猡掐死。她揩着眼泪，点头表示赞同他们的话。她说她同他的关系就此结束，她要离开他，何况斯泰内昨天还向她表示，他要大力把她捧成明星呢。克拉利瑟听后很诧异，因为这位银行家已经一文不名；但是普律利埃尔却笑起来，提醒大家注意，这个该死的犹太人诡计多端，过去他缠住罗丝不放，目的是把他的朗德盐场弄到交易所做投机。现在，他正在抛出一项新计划，要在博斯普鲁斯海峡开凿一条隧道。西蒙娜兴致勃勃地听着。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1791');"><p>As to Clarisse, she had been raging for a week past. Just fancy, that beast La Faloise, whom she had succeeded in chucking into Gaga's venerable embrace, was coming into the fortune of a very rich uncle! It was just her luck; she had always been destined to make things cozy for other people. Then, too, that pig Bordenave had once more given her a mere scrap of a part, a paltry fifty lines, just as if she could not have played Geraldine! She was yearning for that role and hoping that Nana would refuse it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1791" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>至于克拉利瑟，一个星期来，一直怏怏不乐，拉法卢瓦兹这个畜生被她抛弃后，一头钻进了老女人加加的怀抱里，不是就要继承一个富翁伯父的财产吗！她没有指望了，倒霉的事全让她碰上了。另外，博尔德纳夫这个下流家伙让她演一个无足轻重的角色，台词一共只有五十行，好像她不能演热拉尔迪娜一样！她渴望演这个角色，她希望娜娜拒绝演这个角色。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1792');"><p>"Well, and what about me?" said Prulliere with much bitterness. "I haven't got more than two hundred lines. I wanted to give the part up. It's too bad to make me play that fellow Saint-Firmin; why, it's a regular failure! And then what a style it's written in, my dears! It'll fall dead flat, you may be sure."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1792" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么，我呢？”普律利埃尔一本正经地说道，“我的台词还不到二百行。我想推掉不演……让我扮演这个圣菲尔曼，真叫我丢脸，这个人物写得太失败了。朋友们，剧本是什么样的风格！你们知道这个戏一定没人看。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1793');"><p>But just then Simonne, who had been chatting with Father Barillot, came back breathless and announced:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1793" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西蒙娜同巴里约老头谈了一会儿话，现在走过来，气喘吁吁地说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1794');"><p>"By the by, talking of Nana, she's in the house."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1794" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们不是谈到娜娜吗，她就在大厅里。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1795');"><p>"Where, where?" asked Clarisse briskly, getting up to look for her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1795" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她在哪儿？”克拉利瑟立刻问道，一边站起来向四处张望。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1796');"><p>The news spread at once, and everyone craned forward. The rehearsal was, as it were, momentarily interrupted. But Bordenave emerged from his quiescent condition, shouting:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1796" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这个消息立刻传开了。每个人都俯身张望，排演中断了一会儿。博尔德纳夫从昏昏欲睡的状态中清醒过来，叫喊道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1797');"><p>"What's up, eh? Finish the act, I say. And be quiet out there; it's unbearable!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1797" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么？发生什么事啦？把这一幕排演完……那边安静下来，这样叫人受不了！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1798');"><p>Nana was still following the piece from the corner box. Twice Labordette showed an inclination to chat, but she grew impatient and nudged him to make him keep silent. The second act was drawing to a close, when two shadows loomed at the back of the theater. They were creeping softly down, avoiding all noise, and Nana recognized Mignon and Count Muffat. They came forward and silently shook hands with Bordenave.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1798" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜坐在包厢里，一直在看排演。拉博德特两次想同她谈话，她感到很不耐烦，用胳膊肘推开他，叫他住嘴。第二幕就要结束了，这时在舞台后面出现了两个人影。他们蹑手蹑脚从舞台上下来，生怕发出声音。娜娜认出他们是米尼翁和缪法伯爵。他们默不作声地与博尔德纳夫打招呼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1799');"><p>"Ah, there they are," she murmured with a sigh of relief.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1799" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！他们来了。”娜娜舒了口气，喃喃说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1800');"><p>Rose Mignon delivered the last sentences of the act. Thereupon Bordenave said that it was necessary to go through the second again before beginning the third. With that he left off attending to the rehearsal and greeted the count with looks of exaggerated politeness, while Fauchery pretended to be entirely engrossed with his actors, who now grouped themselves round him. Mignon stood whistling carelessly, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed complacently on his wife, who seemed rather nervous.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1800" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗丝米尼翁说出了最后一句台词。这时博尔德纳夫说，在排演第三幕之前，第二幕还要重排演一次；这时，他不看排演了，用过分热情的态度去欢迎伯爵，福什利却假装把注意力完全放在围在他周围的演员身上。米尼翁吹着口哨，双手反剪着，目光盯着他的老婆，罗丝神色有些慌张。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1801');"><p>"Well, shall we go upstairs?" Labordette asked Nana. "I'll install you in the dressing room and come down again and fetch him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1801" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么样？我们上楼好吗？”拉博德特问娜娜，“我先把你带到化妆室里，然后我再下来叫他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1802');"><p>Nana forthwith left the corner box. She had to grope her way along the passage outside the stalls, but Bordenave guessed where she was as she passed along in the dark and caught her up at the end of the corridor passing behind the scenes, a narrow tunnel where the gas burned day and night. Here, in order to bluff her into a bargain, he plunged into a discussion of the courtesan's part.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1802" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜立刻离开了包厢。在黑暗中，她只好沿着正厅前座的过道摸索着往前走。博尔德纳夫猜到在黑暗中走的是娜娜，便赶上去，在过道的一头把她拦住了。这条过道很狭窄，在舞台的后面，煤气灯昼夜不熄。为了赶紧把事情定下来，他开门见山地谈起荡妇这个角色。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1803');"><p>"What a part it is, eh? What a wicked little part! It's made for you. Come and rehearse tomorrow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1803" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯？这是多么好的角色！多么富有魅力！这个角色最适合你演……明天就来参加排演吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1804');"><p>Nana was frigid. She wanted to know what the third act was like.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1804" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜态度冷淡。她想看过第三幕排演再说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1805');"><p>"Oh, it's superb, the third act is! The duchess plays the courtesan in her own house and this disgusts Beaurivage and makes him amend his way. Then there's an awfully funny QUID PRO QUO, when Tardiveau arrives and is under the impression that he's at an opera dancer's house."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1805" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哦！第三幕才精彩呢！……公爵夫人在她自己家里打扮成荡妇的样子，博里瓦热见了很厌恶，从此他便改邪归正了。另外，还有一个滑稽可笑的误会场面，塔迪沃到她家时，还以为到了一位舞女的家里呢……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1806');"><p>"And what does Geraldine do in it all?" interrupted Nana.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1806" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么，热拉尔迪娜在这一幕中的分量怎样呢？”娜娜打断他的话，问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1807');"><p>"Geraldine?" repeated Bordenave in some embarrassment. "She has a scene—not a very long one, but a great success. It's made for you, I assure you! Will you sign?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1807" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“热拉尔迪娜吗？”博尔德纳夫神色尴尬地说道，“有一场戏她要出场，不太长，但很精彩……这个角色简直就是为你而写的，我坦率告诉你，你签字吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1808');"><p>She looked steadily at him and at length made answer:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1808" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她目不转睛地看着他。最后，她回答道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1809');"><p>"We'll see about that all in good time."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1809" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“等会儿再说吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1810');"><p>And she rejoined Labordette, who was waiting for her on the stairs. Everybody in the theater had recognized her, and there was now much whispering, especially between Prulliere, who was scandalized at her return, and Clarisse who was very desirous of the part. As to Fontan, he looked coldly on, pretending unconcern, for he did not think it becoming to round on a woman he had loved. Deep down in his heart, though, his old love had turned to hate, and he nursed the fiercest rancor against her in return for the constant devotion, the personal beauty, the life in common, of which his perverse and monstrous tastes had made him tire.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1810" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，她就走了，赶上了在楼梯上等她的拉博德特。全剧院的人都认出娜娜了。大家都在悄悄谈论她，普律利埃尔对她回剧院很反感，克拉利瑟生怕娜娜抢走她的角色。至于丰唐，他假装无所谓，态度冷漠，觉得在背后说一个自己爱过的女人的坏话，不该是他干的事；其实，过去的热恋现在已经变成了仇恨，由于他有一种恶魔般的反常性欲，他一想到她过去对他忠贞不渝，想到她的娇娆容貌，想到他抛弃的那段共同生活，心里就充满仇恨。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1811');"><p>In the meantime, when Labordette reappeared and went up to the count, Rose Mignon, whose suspicions Nana's presence had excited, understood it all forthwith. Muffat was bothering her to death, but she was beside herself at the thought of being left like this. She broke the silence which she usually maintained on such subjects in her husband's society and said bluntly:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1811" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜的到来已经使罗丝米尼翁警觉起来，看到拉博德特从楼上下来，走到伯爵身边，现在她明白了是怎么回事。缪法已经够她讨厌的了，可是再想到她被他这样抛弃，心里就更怄气了。平常在这类事情上，她同丈夫从不罗嗦，可是这一次她再也不能保持沉默了，她直截了当地对他说： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1812');"><p>"You see what's going on? My word, if she tries the Steiner trick on again I'll tear her eyes out!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1812" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你知道发生什么事情了吧？……我发誓，如果她再耍抢走斯泰内那样的花招，我就要挖掉她的眼睛！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1813');"><p>Tranquilly and haughtily Mignon shrugged his shoulders, as became a man from whom nothing could be hidden.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1813" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>米尼翁听后，泰然自若，态度傲慢，他耸耸肩膀，好像什么他都看得很清楚。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1814');"><p>"Do be quiet," he muttered. "Do me the favor of being quiet, won't you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1814" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“闭起你的嘴吧！”他嘟哝道，“嗯？请你别作声好吗！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1815');"><p>He knew what to rely on now. He had drained his Muffat dry, and he knew that at a sign from Nana he was ready to lie down and be a carpet under her feet. There is no fighting against passions such as that. Accordingly, as he knew what men were, he thought of nothing but how to turn the situation to the best possible account.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1815" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他知道什么事情该认真。他已经把缪法的钱掏得精光，他预料到了，只要娜娜招招手，缪法就会躺下来，让她把自己当地毯踩。缪法已迷恋上她了，这种恋情是无法控制的。他是很了解男人的，所以现在他头脑里考虑的是怎样充分利用有利局面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1816');"><p>It would be necessary to wait on the course of events. And he waited on them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1816" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>应当见机行事，他在等待时机。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1817');"><p>"Rose, it's your turn!" shouted Bordenave. "The second act's being begun again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1817" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“罗丝，上场喽！”博尔德纳夫叫道，“我们重新开始排演前面的两幕吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1818');"><p>"Off with you then," continued Mignon, "and let me arrange matters."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1818" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂，去吧！”米尼翁说道，“让我一个人来应付吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1819');"><p>Then he began bantering, despite all his troubles, and was pleased to congratulate Fauchery on his piece. A very strong piece! Only why was his great lady so chaste? It wasn't natural! With that he sneered and asked who had sat for the portrait of the Duke of Beaurivage, Geraldine's wornout roue. Fauchery smiled; he was far from annoyed. But Bordenave glanced in Muffat's direction and looked vexed, and Mignon was struck at this and became serious again.

The latter was tremulous at the thought of seeing Nana once more. After the rupture had taken place between them there had been a great void in his life. He was idle and fancied himself about to suffer through the sudden change his habits had undergone, and accordingly he had let them take him to see Rose. Besides, his brain had been in such a whirl that he had striven to forget everything and had strenuously kept from seeking out Nana while avoiding an explanation with the countess. He thought, indeed, that he owed his dignity such a measure of forgetfulness. But mysterious forces were at work within, and Nana began slowly to reconquer him. First came thoughts of her, then fleshly cravings and finally a new set of exclusive, tender, well-nigh paternal feelings.

He no longer saw Fontan; he no longer heard the stinging taunt about his wife's adultery with which Nana cast him out of doors. These things were as words whose memory vanished. Yet deep down in his heart there was a poignant smart which wrung him with such increasing pain that it nigh choked him. Childish ideas would occur to him; he imagined that she would never have betrayed him if he had really loved her, and he blamed himself for this. His anguish was becoming unbearable; he was really very wretched. His was the pain of an old wound rather than the blind, present desire which puts up with everything for the sake of immediate possession. He felt a jealous passion for the woman and was haunted by longings for her and her alone, her hair, her mouth, her body. When he remembered the sound of her voice a shiver ran through him; he longed for her as a miser might have done, with refinements of desire beggaring description. He was, in fact, so dolorously possessed by his passion that when Labordette had begun to broach the subject of an assignation he had thrown himself into his arms in obedience to irresistible impulse. Directly afterward he had, of course, been ashamed of an act of self-abandonment which could not but seem very ridiculous in a man of his position; but Labordette was one who knew when to see and when not to see things, and he gave a further proof of his tact when he left the count at the foot of the stairs and without effort let slip only these simple words:

As he passed before the players' waiting room, he had peeped through the open doors and noticed the utter dilapidation of the vast chamber, which looked shamefully stained and worn in broad daylight. But what surprised him most as he emerged from the darkness and confusion of the stage was the pure, clear light and deep quiet at present pervading the lofty staircase, which one evening when he had seen it before had been bathed in gas fumes and loud with the footsteps of women scampering over the different floors. He felt that the dressing rooms were empty, the corridors deserted; not a soul was there; not a sound broke the stillness, while through the square windows on the level of the stairs the pale November sunlight filtered and cast yellow patches of light, full of dancing dust, amid the dead, peaceful air which seemed to descend from the regions above.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1824" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在剧院这个安静的角落里只有缪法一个人。他从演员休息室门口经过时，从敞开的门看进去，只见这间宽广的房间里一派破败景象，在阳光照射下，里面的东西又脏又破旧，令人看了羞愧。但是最使他吃惊的是，他刚走出黑暗、人声嘈杂的舞台，就见楼梯间里光线明亮，一派安静景象，与他以前一天晚上看到的情景迥然不同。那天晚上，他只见里面煤气灯雾腾腾，散场后，女演员们在楼上楼下跑个不停，踩得楼梯咚咚响。现在化妆室里阒无一人，走道里空空荡荡，听不见一点声响，十一月份的淡淡阳光，从楼梯旁的方形窗户里射进来，把一片黄灿灿的光亮洒在梯级上，尘埃在空中的阳光中飞舞着，死一般的寂静从楼上传到楼下。

Accordingly on the first-floor landing he leaned up against a wall—for he was sure of not being observed—and pressed his handkerchief to his mouth and gazed at the warped steps, the iron balustrade bright with the friction of many hands, the scraped paint on the walls—all the squalor, in fact, which that house of tolerance so crudely displayed at the pale afternoon hour when courtesans are asleep. When he reached the second floor he had to step over a big yellow cat which was lying curled up on a step. With half-closed eyes this cat was keeping solitary watch over the house, where the close and now frozen odors which the women nightly left behind them had rendered him somnolent.

That little Mathilde, a drab of a young girl, kept her dressing room in a filthy state. Chipped jugs stood about anyhow; the dressing table was greasy, and there was a chair covered with red stains, which looked as if someone had bled over the straw. The paper pasted on walls and ceiling was splashed from top to bottom with spots of soapy water and this smelled so disagreeably of lavender scent turned sour that Nana opened the window and for some moments stayed leaning on the sill, breathing the fresh air and craning forward to catch sight of Mme Bron underneath. She could hear her broom wildly at work on the mildewed pantiles of the narrow court which was buried in shadow. A canary, whose cage hung on a shutter, was trilling away piercingly. The sound of carriages in the boulevard and neighboring streets was no longer audible, and the quiet and the wide expanse of sleeping sunlight suggested the country. Looking farther afield, her eye fell on the small buildings and glass roofs of the galleries in the passage and, beyond these, on the tall houses in the Rue Vivienne, the backs of which rose silent and apparently deserted over against her. There was a succession of terrace roofs close by, and on one of these a photographer had perched a big cagelike construction of blue glass. It was all very gay, and Nana was becoming absorbed in contemplation, when it struck her someone had knocked at the door.

And as though he were afraid of seeing her take her departure, he pushed her down on the solitary chair in the room. Then he paced about in growing agitation. The little dressing room was airless and full of sunlight, and no sound from the outside world disturbed its pleasant, peaceful, dampish atmosphere. In the pauses of conversation the shrillings of the canary were alone audible and suggested the distant piping of a flute.

When he felt her thus—when he once more divined the presence of her velvety limbs beneath the thin fabric of her dress—he was suddenly convulsed and trembled, as it were, with fever, while madly, savagely, he pressed his face against her knees as though he had been anxious to force through her flesh. The old chair creaked, and beneath the low ceiling, where the air was pungent with stale perfumes, smothered sobs of desire were audible.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1847" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>不过，他已经耍孩子脾气了。他跪在她的脚下，一把抱住她的腰，把腰搂得紧紧的，脸埋在她的双膝之间，紧紧贴在她的肌肉上。这样他感觉触到了她的肌肉，感觉触到了她薄薄的裙子下面的丝绒般柔软的腿上的肌肉，浑身不禁痉挛起来，像发热病一般，直打哆嗦，疯狂地在她的腿上乱碰乱撞，仿佛要钻进她的身体里。那张旧椅子咯吱咯吱作响。在低矮的天花板下，在被过去的香粉染臭的空气中，强烈的肉欲要求使他泣不成声。

As to Muffat, he followed her movements with eyes still wet with tears. He was stupefied by this sudden transition from anguish to comedy. She walked about for a moment or two in order the more thoroughly to show off her paces, and as she walked she smiled subtlely, closed her eyes demurely and managed her skirts with great dexterity.

</p></origin><translate id="div_1885" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但她又觉得拿这句话作为理由，说出来有点生硬。她只淡淡一笑，这古怪的一笑包含了那句话的意思。缪法抬起眼睛瞧着她，随即又把眼睛低下来，他的脸色苍白，心里忐忑不安。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1898');"><p>When she had pushed him from the room after firing his blood with a rain of kisses on hands and on face, she panted awhile. Good heavens, what an unpleasant smell there was in that slut Mathilde's dressing room! It was warm, if you will, with the tranquil warmth peculiar to rooms in the south when the winter sun shines into them, but really, it smelled far too strong of stale lavender water, not to mention other less cleanly things! She opened the window and, again leaning on the window sill, began watching the glass roof of the passage below in order to kill time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1898" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜的吻像雨点一般落在缪法的手上和脸上，把他吻得身上发热了，便把他推到门外，这时，她才舒了一口气。天哪！这间化妆室里怎么有一股怪味。马蒂尔德真懒！不过，人在里面倒是挺惬意的，像在普鲁旺斯那里的卧室里，冬天的阳光照进来，既暖和又安静，不过，变质的香水味，还有其它脏东西的气味，确实太浓了。她打开窗户，把胳膊肘支在窗台上，出神地瞧着胡同里的玻璃天棚，这样来消磨时间。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1900');"><p>"Cut it all out then," he was shouting. "I should prefer that! Just fancy, I haven't two hundred lines, and they're still cutting me down. No, by Jove, I've had enough of it; I give the part up."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1901');"><p>He took a little crumpled manuscript book out of his pocket and fingered its leaves feverishly, as though he were just about to throw it on Cossard's lap. His pale face was convulsed by outraged vanity; his lips were drawn and thin, his eyes flamed; he was quite unable to conceal the struggle that was going on inside him. To think that he, Prulliere, the idol of the public, should play a part of only two hundred lines!
</p></origin><translate id="div_1901" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他从衣袋里掏出一本弄皱了的笔记本，在激动得颤抖的手里转来转去，样子像要把它扔到科萨尔的膝盖上。他很痛苦，他的虚荣心受到了伤害，苍白的脸抽搐着，嘴唇抿得紧紧的，眸子里燃烧着怒火，内心的激动怎么也掩饰不住了。他呀，普律利埃尔，是观众崇拜的偶像，竟然演仅有两百行台词的角色！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1902');"><p>"Why not make me bring in letters on a tray?" he continued bitterly.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1903');"><p>"Come, come, Prulliere, behave decently," said Bordenave, who was anxious to treat him tenderly because of his influence over the boxes. "Don't begin making a fuss. We'll find some points. Eh, Fauchery, you'll add some points? In the third act it would even be possible to lengthen a scene out."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1903" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“行啦，普律利埃尔，别生气了，”博尔德纳夫说道，他对普律利埃尔很客气，因为他对包厢观众很有吸引力，“别再闹情绪了……可以为你增加效果，是吗？福什利，你给他增加一些效果……在第三幕里，甚至还可以增加一场嘛。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1905');"><p>Fauchery's silence seemed to give consent, and Prulliere, still greatly agitated and discontented despite everything, put his part back into his pocket. Bosc and Fontan had appeared profoundly indifferent during the course of this explanation. Let each man fight for his own hand, they reflected; the present dispute had nothing to do with them; they had no interest therein! All the actors clustered round Fauchery and began questioning him and fishing for praise, while Mignon listened to the last of Prulliere's complaints without, however, losing sight of Count Muffat, whose return he had been on the watch for.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1905" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>福什利一言不发，样子像是同意了，普律利埃尔把本子放进衣袋里，仍然心绪不宁，很不高兴。博斯克和丰唐在他们争吵时，两个人都显出无动于衷的态度。每个人都关心自己的事情，这与他们没有关系，他们丝毫不感兴趣。所有演员把福什利团团围住，向他提问题，都希望他赞扬自己几句。米尼翁则听着普律利埃尔的最后几句埋怨话，同时眼睛盯着缪法，伯爵回来了，他已看见他回来了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1906');"><p>Entering in the half-light, the count had paused at the back of the stage, for he hesitated to interrupt the quarrel. But Bordenave caught sight of him and ran forward.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1908');"><p>He ceased speaking, and silence reigned while Muffat sought how to broach his announcement gently. But he failed and, in order to get out of his difficulty the more quickly, ended by an abrupt announcement:

That great thing Nana playing the duchess might possibly prove amusing! Besides, now that this had happened he had Muffat well in his grasp. Accordingly he was not long in coming to a decision, and so he turned round and called out:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1914" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两人又沉默起来。其实，让娜娜演公爵夫人，经理也无所谓，这个胖乎乎的娜娜扮演公爵夫人，说不定挺有趣呢。何况，通过这件事，他可以把缪法牢牢控制住。因此，他马上作出决定，他转过身子，叫道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1915');"><p>"Fauchery!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1915" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“福什利！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1916');"><p>The count had been on the point of stopping him. But Fauchery did not hear him, for he had been pinned against the curtain by Fontan and was being compelled to listen patiently to the comedian's reading of the part of Tardiveau. Fontan imagined Tardiveau to be a native of Marseilles with a dialect, and he imitated the dialect. He was repeating whole speeches. Was that right? Was this the thing? Apparently he was only submitting ideas to Fauchery of which he was himself uncertain, but as the author seemed cold and raised various objections, he grew angry at once.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1916" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵做了一个手势，想不让他跟福什利讲。福什利没有听见叫他，他被丰唐拉到舞台的檐幕边，耐着性子听这位演员讲述他对塔迪沃这个角色是如何理解的。丰唐认为塔迪沃是马赛人，因为他讲话操南方口音；于是他就模仿南方口音。他背了整整几段台词，问福什利对不对？看来他也只是提出一些想法，对不对，他还没有把握。可是福什利态度冷漠，并且提出一些不同看法。丰唐马上发火了。很好！既然他抓不住这个角色的精神，为了替大家着想，最好他还是不演这个角色。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1917');"><p>Oh, very well, the moment the spirit of the part escaped him it would be better for all concerned that he shouldn't act it at all!

They went down a few steps and entered a square room, whose two windows opened upon the courtyard. A faint light stole through the dirty panes and hung wanly under the low ceiling. In pigeonholes and shelves, which filled the whole place up, lay a collection of the most varied kind of bric-a-brac. Indeed, it suggested an old-clothes shop in the Rue de Lappe in process of selling off, so indescribable was the hotchpotch of plates, gilt pasteboard cups, old red umbrellas, Italian jars, clocks in all styles, platters and inkpots, firearms and squirts, which lay chipped and broken and in unrecognizable heaps under a layer of dust an inch deep. An unendurable odor of old iron, rags and damp cardboard emanated from the various piles, where the debris of forgotten dramas had been collecting for half a century.

</p></origin><translate id="div_1948" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时候，气氛显得更尴尬了。福什利倚在一个架子上，一股劲儿地跺着脚，缪法一直转动着手中的那只蛋杯，仿佛在专心研究它。

Now look, just look at all that!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1951" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对不起，把你身上搞的满是灰尘。”经理一边继续说道，一边把蛋杯放回木板上，“你知道，如果每天打扫灰尘，灰尘也是打扫不完的……所以，这儿不大干净。哎？乱七八糟！……不过，你也许会相信我的话，这里面还有些值钱的东西。看吧，把这里的东西都看看吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1952');"><p>He walked Muffat round in front of the pigeonholes and shelves and in the greenish light which filtered through the courtyard, told him the names of different properties, for he was anxious to interest him in his marine-stores inventory, as he jocosely termed it.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1953');"><p>Presently, when they had returned into Fauchery's neighborhood, he said carelessly enough:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1953" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>随后，他们回到了福什利身边，他用轻快的口气说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1954');"><p>"Listen, since we're all of one mind, we'll finish the matter at once. Here's Mignon, just when he's wanted."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1954" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“听我说吧，既然我们大家都同意了，事情就这样定了……正好米尼翁也来了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1955');"><p>For some little time past Mignon had been prowling in the adjoining passage, and the very moment Bordenave began talking of a modification of their agreement he burst into wrathful protest. It was infamous—they wanted to spoil his wife's career—he'd go to law about it! Bordenave, meanwhile, was extremely calm and full of reasons. He did not think the part worthy of Rose, and he preferred to reserve her for an operetta, which was to be put on after the Petite Duchesse. But when her husband still continued shouting he suddenly offered to cancel their arrangement in view of the offers which the Folies-Dramatiques had been making the singer. At this Mignon was momentarily put out, so without denying the truth of these offers he loudly professed a vast disdain for money. His wife, he said, had been engaged to play the Duchess Helene, and she would play the part even if he, Mignon, were to be ruined over it. His dignity, his honor, were at stake! Starting from this basis, the discussion grew interminable. The manager, however, always returned to the following argument: since the Folies had offered Rose three hundred francs a night during a hundred performances, and since she only made a hundred and fifty with him, she would be the gainer by fifteen thousand francs the moment he let her depart. The husband, on his part, did not desert the artist's position. What would people say if they saw his wife deprived of her part? Why, that she was not equal to it; that it had been deemed necessary to find a substitute for her! And this would do great harm to Rose's reputation as an artist; nay, it would diminish it. Oh no, no! Glory before gain! Then without a word of warning he pointed out a possible arrangement: Rose, according to the terms of her agreement, was pledged to pay a forfeit of ten thousand francs in case she gave up the part. Very well then, let them give her ten thousand francs, and she would go to the Folies-Dramatiques. Bordenave was utterly dumfounded while Mignon, who had never once taken his eyes off the count, tranquilly awaited results.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1955" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>米尼翁在走廊里逛了好一阵子了。博尔德纳夫谈到要修改合同的事，米尼翁刚听了几句，就大发雷霆；真无耻，这是要葬送他老婆的前途，他要进行诉讼。然而，博尔德纳夫很冷静，他讲了很多道理来说服他；他觉得罗丝演这个角色是大才小用，他想把罗丝抽出来，等《小公爵夫人》演过后，让她主演一出轻歌剧里的角色。但是，由于罗丝的丈夫总是大吵大嚷，博尔德纳夫便断然提出要解除合同，因为这位女歌手接受了游乐剧院的聘请。这一下把米尼翁弄得不知所措。他并不否认聘请这件事，但他装出一副蔑视金钱的样子；既然已经聘请了他的老婆演埃莱娜公爵夫人，她就一定要演，他米尼翁纵然丢了财产也在所不惜，这是关系到一个人的尊严、荣誉的问题。争论到这里，问题就变得复杂了。经理总是抓住这条理由：既然游乐剧院愿意每晚演出付给罗丝三百法郎，总共要演一百场，而她为他演出每晚只能得到一百五十法郎，这样，他把她放走后，她就能多挣一万五千法郎。但是丈夫又提出艺术方面的问题，并抓住不放：如果人家看到他老婆被取消演这个角色，会怎样议论呢？人家会说她演不了这个角色，所以不得不把她换掉；因此，对一个艺术家来说，就蒙受了巨大的损失，声誉就会下降。不行，不行，绝对不行，荣誉比金钱还重要！接着，他突然提出一项妥协方案：根据合同，罗丝如果自动退出这个角色，她要付一万法郎违约金；现在是别人要她退出，那么，只要赔偿她一万法郎，她就去游乐剧院。博尔德纳夫听了，一下子愣住了，米尼翁的眼睛盯住伯爵，静静地等待他的回答。

Such had been his curiosity that he had come down and posted himself there, but the moment he understood the state of the case he went upstairs again and enjoyed the treat of telling Rose. Dear me! They were just haggling in her behalf! He dinned his words into her ears; she ran off to the property room. They were silent as she entered. She looked at the four men. Muffat hung his head; Fauchery answered her questioning glance with a despairing shrug of the shoulders; as to Mignon, he was busy discussing the terms of the agreement with Bordenave.

</p></origin><translate id="div_1963" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她浑身哆嗦起来，面色苍白，两只小手捏得紧紧的。她憋了一肚子气，直愣愣地瞅着她的丈夫，平时碰到生意上的事情，她对丈夫总是言听计从，让她丈夫作主，由他与经理和她的情夫签订合同。她气得一句话也说不出来，只大叫一声，这叫声像一根鞭子抽在她丈夫的脸上。

He began explaining to her in low tones that ten thousand francs from one party and fifteen thousand from the other came to twenty-five thousand. A splendid deal! Muffat was getting rid of her in every sense of the word; it was a pretty trick to have plucked him of this last feather! But Rose in her anger vouchsafed no answer. Whereupon Mignon in disdain left her to her feminine spite and, turning to Bordenave, who was once more on the stage with Fauchery and Muffat, said:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1965" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，她便走了。米尼翁惊慌失措，跟在她后面追上去。怎么回事，难道她疯了？他轻声向她解释，一边得一万法郎，另一边得一万五千法郎，共计二万五千法郎。这可是一笔绝好的买卖！不管怎样，缪法抛弃了她，最后从他的翅膀上拔一根羽毛，这是巧妙的做法。罗丝怒不可遏，一声不吭。米尼翁不屑与她多费口舌，便离开了她，任她去发泄女人的怨气。博尔德纳夫与福什利和缪法已经回到舞台上了，米尼翁对博尔德纳夫说道：

She was quite the honest woman now and wore a most distinguished expression in order to overwhelm her friends and prove to the idiots that when she chose she could give them all points in the matter of smartness. But she nearly got into trouble, for at the sight of her Rose darted forward, choking with rage and stuttering:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1967" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>拉博德特已经把这个消息告诉了娜娜，正巧，这时她得意洋洋走下来。她演正经女人，摆出一副高贵的派头，目的是要让她的同事们对她刮目相看，并且向这伙笨蛋证实，只要她想演，哪一个女人也没有她演得漂亮。但是，她差点出个洋相。罗丝瞥见了她，便向她冲过去，她气得透不过气来，结结巴巴地说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1968');"><p>"Yes, you, I'll pay you out! Things can't go on like this; d'you understand?" Nana forgot herself in face of this brisk attack and was going to put her arms akimbo and give her what for. But she controlled herself and, looking like a marquise who is afraid of treading on an orange peel, fluted in still more silvery tones.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1968" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你呀，我总有一天再见到你的……我们这笔帐总是要算的，听见了吗？” 娜娜受到这样突然袭击，顿时把什么都忘了，她想马上双手叉腰，破口大骂她是婊子。但她克制住了，摆出一个侯爵夫人险些踩到桔子皮时的神态，过分尖声尖气地说道：

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1970');"><p>And with that she continued in her graceful affectation while Rose took her departure, followed by Mignon, who now refused to recognize her. Clarisse was enraptured, having just obtained the part of Geraldine from Bordenave. Fauchery, on the other hand, was gloomy; he shifted from one foot to the other; he could not decide whether to leave the theater or no. His piece was bedeviled, and he was seeking how best to save it. But Nana came up, took him by both hands and, drawing him toward her, asked whether he thought her so very atrocious after all. She wasn't going to eat his play—not she! Then she made him laugh and gave him to understand that he would be foolish to be angry with her, in view of his relationship to the Muffats. If, she said, her memory failed her she would take her lines from the prompter. The house, too, would be packed in such a way as to ensure applause. Besides, he was mistaken about her, and he would soon see how she would rattle through her part. By and by it was arranged that the author should make a few changes in the role of the duchess so as to extend that of Prulliere. The last-named personage was enraptured. Indeed, amid all the joy which Nana now quite naturally diffused, Fontan alone remained unmoved. In the middle of the yellow lamplight, against which the sharp outline of his goatlike profile shone out with great distinctness, he stood showing off his figure and affecting the pose of one who has been cruelly abandoned. Nana went quietly up and shook hands with him.

Meanwhile the players were waiting about, but Bordenave said that the third act would not be rehearsed. And so it chanced that old Bosc went grumbling away at the proper time, whereas usually the company were needlessly detained and lost whole afternoons in consequence. Everyone went off. Down on the pavement they were blinded by the broad daylight and stood blinking their eyes in a dazed sort of way, as became people who had passed three hours squabbling with tight-strung nerves in the depths of a cellar. The count, with racked limbs and vacant brain, got into a conveyance with Nana, while Labordette took Fauchery off and comforted him.

She was atrociously bad and displayed such pretentions toward high comedy that the public grew mirthful. They did not hiss—they were too amused. From a stage box Rose Mignon kept greeting her rival's successive entrances with a shrill laugh, which set the whole house off. It was the beginning of her revenge. Accordingly, when at night Nana, greatly chagrined, found herself alone with Muffat, she said furiously:
