</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4957');"><p>When he had taken his pleasure, Khal Drogo rose from their sleeping mats to tower above her. His skin shone dark as bronze in the ruddy light from the brazier, the faint lines of old scars visible on his broad chest. Ink-black hair, loose and unbound, cascaded over his shoulders and down his back, well past his waist. His manhood glistened wetly. The khal’s mouth twisted in a frown beneath the droop of his long mustachio. "The stallion who mounts the world has no need of iron chairs."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4957" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥满足之后，便从他们睡觉的草席上站起来，高高地立在她身边。在火盆的红润光线照耀下，他的皮肤沉黑有如青铜，旧时伤疤的线条在他宽阔的胸膛上若隐若现。他的墨黑长发松散开来，如瀑布般垂过肩膀，沿着背部直下腰际。卡奥的嘴巴隐藏于长长的胡须之下，这时有些不悦地抿起双唇。”骑着世界的骏马不需要铁椅子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4958');"><p>Dany propped herself on an elbow to look up at him, so tall and magnificent. She loved his hair especially. It had never been cut; he had never known defeat. "It was prophesied that the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4958" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮用手肘撑起身子，抬头望着他。他是如此雄伟高大，她尤其钟爱他的头发。 他从未剪过；因为他从未战败。“预言所载，骏马将行至世界尽头。”她说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4959');"><p>"The earth ends at the black salt sea," Drogo answered at once. He wet a cloth in a basin of warm water to wipe the sweat and oil from his skin. "No horse can cross the poison water."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4959" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“世界的尽头是黑色咸海，”卓戈立刻答道。他把布在温水盆里浸湿，揩掉皮肤上的汗水和油。“没有马可以穿越毒水。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4960');"><p>"In the Free Cities, there are ships by the thousand," Dany told him, as she had told him before. "Wooden horses with a hundred legs, that fly across the sea on wings full of wind."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4960" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“自由贸易城邦有几千艘船，”丹妮一如既往地告诉他，”它们就像生了几百只脚的木马”能够乘风展翼，横越海洋。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4961');"><p>Khal Drogo did not want to hear it. "We will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs." He dropped the cloth and began to dress. "This day I will go to the grass and hunt, woman wife," he announced as he shrugged into a painted vest and buckled on a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver, gold, and bronze.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4961" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥不想听。“我们不要再谈木马和铁椅子。”他丢下湿布，开始穿衣服。“女人妻子，今天我将到草原上打猎。”他一边穿上彩绘背心，扣上沉重的金银铜章大腰带，一边宣布。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4962');"><p>"Yes, my sun-and-stars," Dany said. Drogo would take his bloodriders and ride in search of hrakkar, the great white lion of the plains. If they returned triumphant, her lord husband’s joy would be fierce, and he might be willing to hear her out.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4962" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好的，我的日和星。”丹妮说。卓戈会带他的血盟卫外出寻找“赫拉卡”，就是草原上的大白狮。假如他们得手归来，夫君必是兴高采烈，或许就会听她的话。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4963');"><p>Savage beasts he did not fear, nor any man who had ever drawn breath, but the sea was a different matter. To the Dothraki, water that a horse could not drink was something foul; the heaving grey-green plains of the ocean filled them with superstitious loathing. Drogo was a bolder man than the other horselords in half a hundred ways, she had found?.?.?.?but not in this. If only she could get him onto a ship?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4963" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他不畏凶猛野兽，或是世上任何一人，但海洋却不同。对多斯拉克人而言，只要马不能喝的水就是不洁的东西，波涛汹涌的灰绿洋面让他们有种迷信的憎厌。她很清楚，卓戈在无数方面都比其他马王勇敢……只有这点他做不到。若她有办法让他上船就好了……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4964');"><p>After the khal and his bloodriders had ridden off with their bows, Dany summoned her handmaids. Her body felt so fat and ungainly now that she welcomed the help of their strong arms and deft hands, whereas before she had often been uncomfortable with the way they fussed and fluttered about her. They scrubbed her clean and dressed her in sandsilk, loose and flowing. As Doreah combed out her hair, she sent Jhiqui to find Ser Jorah Mormont.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4964" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等卡奥和他的血盟卫带着弓箭离开后，丹妮召来女仆。从前她对于她们东摸西碰感到不适，如今身体越发臃肿笨拙，她反而喜欢她们健壮的臂膀和灵巧的双手。她们为她擦洗干净，穿上松滑的纱丝服饰。多莉亚一边帮她梳头，她一边差姬琪去把乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士找来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4965');"><p>The knight came at once. He wore horsehair leggings and painted vest, like a rider. Coarse black hair covered his thick chest and muscular arms. "My princess. How may I serve you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4965" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>骑士立刻前来，他穿着马鬃绑腿，彩绘背心，和多斯拉克人无异。粗黑的体毛覆盖了他厚实的胸膛和健壮的手臂。“公主殿下，请问您有何吩咐? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4966');"><p>"You must talk to my lord husband," Dany said. "Drogo says the stallion who mounts the world will have all the lands of the earth to rule, and no need to cross the poison water. He talks of leading his khalasar east after Rhaego is born, to plunder the lands around the Jade Sea."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4966" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你得和我夫君谈谈，”丹妮说，“卓戈说骑着世界的骏马将统治全世界，但无需横越毒水。他还说等雷戈出生后，要率领卡拉萨往东走，去掠夺玉海沿岸的土地。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4967');"><p>The knight looked thoughtful. "The khal has never seen the Seven Kingdoms," he said. "They are nothing to him. If he thinks of them at all, no doubt he thinks of islands, a few small cities clinging to rocks in the manner of Lorath or Lys, surrounded by stormy seas. The riches of the east must seem a more tempting prospect."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4967" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>骑士似乎若有所思。“卡奥从未见过七大王国，”他说。“七国对他来说什么都不是。就算他真的想过，大概也以为那只是建在一群小岛上的城邦，周围是风暴不息的海洋，就像罗拉斯或里斯那样，相较之下，富饶的东方想必更吸引入罢。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4968');"><p>"But he must ride west," Dany said, despairing. "Please, help me make him understand." She had never seen the Seven Kingdoms either, no more than Drogo, yet she felt as though she knew them from all the tales her brother had told her. Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he would take her back one day, but he was dead now and his promises had died with him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4968" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可他一定得朝西走，”丹妮急了起来。“求求你，请帮助我让他了解罢。”其实，她和卓戈一样没见过七大王国，但听了哥哥所说的那些故事，她却觉得自己很熟悉。韦赛里斯承诺过几千几百次有朝一日会带她回家，但他已经死了，所有的诺言自然也都不算数了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4969');"><p>"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons," the knight answered. "Have patience, Princess. Do not make your brother’s mistake. We will go home, I promise you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4969" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“多斯拉克人行事自有其步调和理由，”骑士回答，“公主，请您耐心等待，不要重蹈你哥哥的覆辙。我们会回家的，我向你保证。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4970');"><p>Home? The word made her feel sad. Ser Jorah had his Bear Island, but what was home to her? A few tales, names recited as solemnly as the words of a prayer, the fading memory of a red door?.?.?.?was Vaes Dothrak to be her home forever? When she looked at the crones of the dosh khaleen, was she looking at her future?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4970" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>家?这个字眼令她悲伤。乔拉爵士有熊岛可归，但她的家在哪里? 是那几个故事，那几个有如祷词般庄严吟诵的名号，还是回忆中逐渐消逝的红漆大门?……难道维斯•多斯拉克将是她永恒的归宿? 当她看着多希卡林的众老妪时，她可是目睹了自己的未来?
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4971');"><p>Ser Jorah must have seen the sadness on her face. "A great caravan arrived during the night, Khaleesi. Four hundred horses, from Pentos by way of Norvos and Qohor, under the command of Merchant Captain Byan Votyris. Illyrio may have sent a letter. Would you care to visit the Western Market?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4971" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士应是察觉到她脸上的哀伤。“卡丽熙，昨晚有大批商队进城，足足有四百匹马，他们从潘托斯经诺佛斯和科霍尔而来，由商队统领拜安•佛提利斯领队。伊利里欧曾答应与我们通信联络，说不定捎了信来，您要不要到城西市集去逛一趟? ”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4972');"><p>Dany stirred. "Yes," she said. "I would like that." The markets came alive when a caravan had come in. You could never tell what treasures the traders might bring this time, and it would be good to hear men speaking Valyrian again, as they did in the Free Cities. "Irri, have them prepare a litter."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4972" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮起身。“好的。”她说，“我很想去。”每当有商队进城，市集便会热闹起来。你永远也不知道这回商人们又带来什么奇珍异宝，况且能听到有人说瓦雷利亚语，总是件很愉快的事情。自由贸易城邦的人都操这种语言。“伊丽，叫人帮我备轿。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4973');"><p>"I shall tell your khas," Ser Jorah said, withdrawing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4973" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我去通知您的卡斯部众。”乔拉说着也退下。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4974');"><p>If Khal Drogo had been with her, Dany would have ridden her silver. Among the Dothraki, mothers stayed on horseback almost up to the moment of birth, and she did not want to seem weak in her husband’s eyes. But with the khal off hunting, it was pleasant to lie back on soft cushions and be carried across Vaes Dothrak, with red silk curtains to shield her from the sun. Ser Jorah saddled up and rode beside her, with the four young men of her khas and her handmaids.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4974" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>如果卓戈卡奥在她身边，丹妮就会骑小银马外出。多斯拉克女性即使怀孕也依旧骑马，只有临盆前夕才是例外，她自然不想在丈夫眼中自承虚弱。不过，既然卡奥已经外出打猎，她便可舒服地躺在靠垫上，坐轿子让人抬着穿越维斯•多斯拉克，还有红丝帷幕为她遮挡骄阳。乔拉爵士策马骑行在她身边，同行的还有四名年轻的卡斯部众与三位女仆。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4975');"><p>The day was warm and cloudless, the sky a deep blue. When the wind blew, she could smell the rich scents of grass and earth. As her litter passed beneath the stolen monuments, she went from sunlight to shadow and back again. Dany swayed along, studying the faces of dead heroes and forgotten kings. She wondered if the gods of burned cities could still answer prayers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4975" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>天气和煦无云，晴空湛蓝。微风吹起，她闻到青草和土地的浓郁芬香。轿子从夺自异邦的神祗雕像下经过，她也随之脱离日光，进入阴影，接着再返回日光。一路上，丹妮随着轿子轻轻摇晃，审视着故去的英雄和被遗忘的国王们的脸庞，不知那些曾受人崇敬，如今信徒的城市早巳付之一炬的诸神，是否依旧能应许她的祈祷。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4976');"><p>If I were not the blood of the dragon, she thought wistfully, this could be my home. She was khaleesi, she had a strong man and a swift horse, handmaids to serve her, warriors to keep her safe, an honored place in the dosh khaleen awaiting her when she grew old?.?.?.?and in her womb grew a son who would one day bestride the world. That should be enough for any woman?.?.?.?but not for the dragon. With Viserys gone, Daenerys was the last, the very last. She was the seed of kings and conquerors, and so too the child inside her. She must not forget.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4976" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>假如我不是真龙血脉，她满心思慕地想，这里就会是我的家。她身为卡丽熙，有一个强壮的男人和一匹迅捷的马，还有服侍她的女仆、保护她的武士，年老之后，还有多希卡林受人敬重的地位等着她……而且，在她的子宫里，那有朝一日将统御世界的儿子正日渐成长，对任何女人来说，都应该心满意足……然而对真龙来说，这样却是不够的。韦赛里斯既死，丹妮莉丝便是独一无二的真龙传人，她是国王与征服者的后裔，她体内的孩子也将继承这样的命运。她不敢忘却。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4977');"><p>The Western Market was a great square of beaten earth surrounded by warrens of mud-baked brick, animal pens, whitewashed drinking halls. Hummocks rose from the ground like the backs of great subterranean beasts breaking the surface, yawning black mouths leading down to cool and cavernous storerooms below. The interior of the square was a maze of stalls and crookback aisles, shaded by awnings of woven grass.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4977" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>城西市集占地广大，呈正方形，四周由泥砖小屋、牲畜圈栏，以及石灰粉涂砌的酒厅所环绕。地面突起小丘，宛如无数硕大无朋、潜伏地底的怪兽，脊梁破地而出，张开的黑色大口，直通地下阴凉宽阔的储藏室。方形正中则是一座由摊贩和崎岖过道构成的迷宫，上方用长草织成的天篷遮盖。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4978');"><p>A hundred merchants and traders were unloading their goods and setting up in stalls when they arrived, yet even so the great market seemed hushed and deserted compared to the teeming bazaars that Dany remembered from Pentos and the other Free Cities. The caravans made their way to Vaes Dothrak from east and west not so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other, Ser Jorah had explained. The riders let them come and go unmolested, so long as they observed the peace of the sacred city, did not profane the Mother of Mountains or the Womb of the World, and honored the crones of the dosh khaleen with the traditional gifts of salt, silver, and seed. The Dothraki did not truly comprehend this business of buying and selling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4978" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们抵达之时，上百个商人正忙着卸货摆摊，然而与潘托斯和其他自由贸易城邦的市集广场相比，这里依旧显得宁静而冷清。乔拉爵士向她解释，商队从东西两方来到此处，主要目的不在于和多斯拉克人做买卖，而是与其他商人交易。游牧民族让他们自由来去，只要他们遵守圣城中不得动武的戒条，不亵渎圣母山与世界的子宫湖，并按传统赠与多希卡林老妪盐、银子和种子等礼品即可。其实多斯拉克人并不了解买卖这种行为。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4979');"><p>Dany liked the strangeness of the Eastern Market too, with all its queer sights and sounds and smells. She often spent her mornings there, nibbling tree eggs, locust pie, and green noodles, listening to the high ululating voices of the spellsingers, gaping at manticores in silver cages and immense grey elephants and the striped black-and-white horses of the Jogos Nhai. She enjoyed watching all the people too: dark solemn Asshai’i and tall pale Qartheen, the bright-eyed men of Yi Ti in monkey-tail hats, warrior maids from Bayasabhad, Shamyriana, and Kayakayanaya with iron rings in their nipples and rubies in their cheeks, even the dour and frightening Shadow Men, who covered their arms and legs and chests with tattoos and hid their faces behind masks. The Eastern Market was a place of wonder and magic for Dany.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4979" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮也很喜欢城东市集，那里的事物、声音和气味都充满异国情调。她时常整个早上泡在那里，吃吃树卵、蝗虫馅饼和绿面条，听听吟咒师高亢的嚎叫，张大嘴巴看着来自鸠格斯奈，关在银笼子里的狮首蝎尾兽、巨大无比的灰象、以及黑白斑马。她也喜欢观看形形色色的人群：肤色黝黑、表情凝重的亚夏人；高大白皙的魁尔斯人；头戴猴尾帽、眼睛炯炯有神的夷地人；以及来自巴亚撒布哈德、沙米利安纳和卡亚卡亚纳亚等地，乳头串上铁环、两颊镶着红玉的处女战士；甚至是面色阴郁、令人害怕的阴影之民，他们的手、脚和胸膛上都是刺青，脸则用面具遮住。对丹妮而言， 城东市集是个充满惊奇和魔法的地方。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4980');"><p>But the Western Market smelled of home.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4980" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但城西市集，却有家的味道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4981');"><p>As Irri and Jhiqui helped her from her litter, she sniffed, and recognized the sharp odors of garlic and pepper, scents that reminded Dany of days long gone in the alleys of Tyrosh and Myr and brought a fond smile to her face. Under that she smelled the heady sweet perfumes of Lys. She saw slaves carrying bolts of intricate Myrish lace and fine wools in a dozen rich colors. Caravan guards wandered among the aisles in copper helmets and knee-length tunics of quilted yellow cotton, empty scabbards swinging from their woven leather belts. Behind one stall an armorer displayed steel breastplates worked with gold and silver in ornate patterns, and helms hammered in the shapes of fanciful beasts. Next to him was a pretty young woman selling Lannisport goldwork, rings and brooches and torcs and exquisitely wrought medallions suitable for belting. A huge eunuch guarded her stall, mute and hairless, dressed in sweat-stained velvets and scowling at anyone who came close. Across the aisle, a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was haggling with a Pentoshi over the price of some green dye, the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and forth as he shook his head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4981" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊丽和姬琪扶她步下轿子，她借机嗅了一下，立刻辨出大蒜和胡椒的辛辣味道，令她回忆起从前在泰洛西和密尔巷弄里的日子，不禁开心地笑了出来。在这些味道之外，她又闻到里斯甜腻得令人头晕目眩的香水味。她看见奴隶背着繁重的密尔蕾丝和十数种颜色的高级羊毛。商队守卫戴着赤铜盔，身披加衬里的黄棉及膝长袍，逡巡于过道之间，空空的剑鞘悬荡在皮腰带上。一个盔甲师父站在摊贩后面，展示着用金银雕饰的精钢胸甲，以及打造成珍禽异兽形状的头盔。在他的摊贩隔壁，有个年轻美妇正在贩售兰尼斯港的金饰，包括戒指、胸针、手镯和精工雕琢、可做成腰带的奖章。她身旁站了一个高大魁梧的太监，不发一语、全身无毛，汗水渗透了他的天鹅绒衣服，他对每个靠近的人都皱眉怒视。走道对面，一位来自夷地的肥胖布商正和一个潘托斯人争论某种绿色染料的价钱，他不停摇头，帽子上的猴尾巴也跟着前后晃动。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4982');"><p>"When I was a little girl, I loved to play in the bazaar," Dany told Ser Jorah as they wandered down the shady aisle between the stalls. "It was so alive there, all the people shouting and laughing, so many wonderful things to look at?.?.?.?though we seldom had enough coin to buy anything?.?.?.?well, except for a sausage now and again, or honeyfingers?.?.?.?do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind they bake in Tyrosh?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4982" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我小时候最喜欢在市集里玩。”丹妮一边同乔拉爵士穿梭于摊位间的遮荫过道，一边对他说，“那里最有活力了，到处都是人，又叫又笑，还有好多新奇事物……虽然我们通常什么也买不起……嗯，除了偶尔买条香肠，或是蜂蜜棒……七大王国里有蜂蜜棒吗?就泰洛西烤的那种? ”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4983');"><p>"Cakes, are they? I could not say, Princess." The knight bowed. "If you would pardon me for a time, I will seek out the captain and see if he has letters for us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4983" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是蛋糕吗?公主殿下，我不知道。”骑士一鞠躬，“请容我暂时告退，我要去找商队统领，看看有没有给我们的信。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4984');"><p>"Very well. I’ll help you find him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4984" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太好了，我也帮你找。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4985');"><p>"There is no need for you to trouble yourself." Ser Jorah glanced away impatiently. "Enjoy the market. I will rejoin you when my business is concluded."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4985" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不必劳动您，”乔拉爵士有些不耐烦地瞄了远处一眼。“请您尽情享受这市集罢，我办完事立刻回来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4986');"><p>Curious, Dany thought as she watched him stride off through the throngs. She didn’t see why she should not go with him. Perhaps Ser Jorah meant to find a woman after he met with the merchant captain. Whores frequently traveled with the caravans, she knew, and some men were queerly shy about their couplings. She gave a shrug. "Come," she told the others.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4986" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这真是奇了，丹妮目送他大步走进人群，心里想着。她想不出有何原因不便让她同行。或许乔拉爵士见了商队统领之后想找个女人吧。她知道妓女通常会随商队行走各地，也知道男人对房事特别难以启齿，于是她耸耸肩。“走罢。”她对其他人说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4987');"><p>Her handmaids trailed along as Dany resumed her stroll through the market. "Oh, look," she exclaimed to Doreah, "those are the kind of sausages I meant." She pointed to a stall where a wizened little woman was grilling meat and onions on a hot firestone. "They make them with lots of garlic and hot peppers." Delighted with her discovery, Dany insisted the others join her for a sausage. Her handmaids wolfed theirs down giggling and grinning, though the men of her khas sniffed at the grilled meat suspiciously. "They taste different than I remember," Dany said after her first few bites.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4987" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮继续在市集里闲逛，她的女仆跟在后面。“啊，你看，”她惊喜地对多莉亚说，“我说的就是这种香肠。”她指指一个摊贩，一位佝偻的矮小妇人正在一颗滚烫的火石上烤着肉和洋葱。 “他们加很多的大蒜和辣椒。”惊喜于自己的发现，丹妮坚持其他人也一起尝尝。女仆“咯咯”笑着大口吃完，她的卡斯部众却满腹狐疑地嗅了嗅烤肉。“吃起来和我印象中不一样。”丹妮吃了几口后评说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4988');"><p>"In Pentos, I make them with pork," the old woman said, "but all my pigs died on the Dothraki sea. These are made of horsemeat, Khaleesi, but I spice them the same."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4988" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在潘托斯，我是用猪肉做的，”老妇人说，“可我的猪通通死在多斯拉克海上。所以这是用马肉做的，卡丽熙，不过酱料完全一样。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4989');"><p>"Oh." Dany felt disappointed, but Quaro liked his sausage so well he decided to have another one, and Rakharo had to outdo him and eat three more, belching loudly. Dany giggled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4989" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“噢。”丹妮觉得有些失望，但是魁洛满喜欢吃，决定再来一根，拉卡洛不甘示弱，结果吃了三根，连连大声打嗝，看得丹妮“咯咯”直笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4990');"><p>"You have not laughed since your brother the Khal Rhaggat was crowned by Drogo," said Irri. "It is good to see, Khaleesi."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4990" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“自从您的哥哥拉迦特卡奥被卓戈戴上王冠之后，您就没再笑过。”伊丽说，“卡丽熙，看到您笑，是一件很美的事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4991');"><p>Dany smiled shyly. It was sweet to laugh. She felt half a girl again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4991" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮怯怯地微笑。能笑真的好棒好美，她觉得自己仿佛又成了小女孩。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4992');"><p>They wandered for half the morning. She saw a beautiful feathered cloak from the Summer Isles, and took it for a gift. In return, she gave the merchant a silver medallion from her belt. That was how it was done among the Dothraki. A birdseller taught a green-and-red parrot to say her name, and Dany laughed again, yet still refused to take him. What would she do with a green-and-red parrot in a khalasar?
