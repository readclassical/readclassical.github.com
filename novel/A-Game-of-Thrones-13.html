</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_963');"><p>The summons came in the hour before the dawn, when the world was still and grey.
</p></origin><translate id="div_963" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王传唤他时，天还未亮，世界一片寂静，灰蒙蒙的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_964');"><p>Alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill, groggy from sleep, to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted. Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears, and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse. "Up, Stark!" he roared. "Up, up! We have matters of state to discuss."
</p></origin><translate id="div_964" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>埃林轻轻地将他自梦中摇醒，奈德睡意未消便踉跄着跌入曙光未露前的清晨，发现自己的坐骑已经鞍辔妥当，而国王本人早已骑乘马上。劳勃戴着棕色厚手套，身披厚重的套头毛皮斗篷，看起来活像只骑在马上的大熊。“史塔克，起床了！”他吼道，“还不快醒醒，咱们有国家大事要商量哪。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_965');"><p>"By all means," Ned said. "Come inside, Your Grace." Alyn lifted the flap of the tent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_965" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“遵命，”奈德说，“陛下，请进帐。”埃林闻言掀起帘幕。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_966');"><p>"No, no, no," Robert said. His breath steamed with every word. "The camp is full of ears. Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours." Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw. There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount up.
</p></origin><translate id="div_966" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不不不，”劳勃的呼吸在冷气里蒸腾，“营地里闲杂人等太多，只怕隔墙有耳。况且我想出去走走，顺便体验一下你的北地风光。”奈德这才瞧见柏洛斯爵士和马林爵士率领十数护卫跟在国王身后。看来除了揉揉惺忪睡眼，更衣上马之外，别无他法了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_967');"><p>Robert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside him, trying to keep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his words away, and the king did not hear him. After that Ned rode in silence. They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist. By then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still Robert would not slow.
</p></origin><translate id="div_967" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃骑着他那匹黑色战马一路狂奔，奈德也只好跟上。他边骑边问了一句，但朔风吹散了他的话音，国王没有听见。之后奈德不再发话，只静静地骑马。他们旋即离开国王大道，奔进黑雾浓郁的辽阔平原。此时护卫已离他们有段距离，再听不见两人交谈，但劳勃仍未减速。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_968');"><p>Dawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up. By then they were miles south of the main party. Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him. "Gods," he swore, laughing, "it feels good to get out and ride the way a man was meant to ride! I swear, Ned, this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad." He had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon. "That damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain?.?.?.?I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I’m going to burn it, and Cersei can walk!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_968" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>直到他们登上一道低缓山脊，晨曦初露，国王方才慢下脚步，此时他们已在营地南方数里之遥。奈德跟上劳勃，只见他满脸通红，神采飞扬。“妈的，”他笑着咒道，“到野外像个男人一样骑他妈一段可真痛快！我告诉你，奈德，那慢吞吞的牛步会把人给逼疯的。”劳勃•拜拉席恩向来不是个有耐性的人。“瞧那天杀的轮宫叽叽嘎嘎的呻吟模样，遇到石子都一副爬山的样子……那鬼东西敢再给我断根车轴，我保证放火烧了它，然后叫瑟曦跟着走路！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_969');"><p>Ned laughed. "I will gladly light the torch for you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_969" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德笑道：“那我很乐意为您点火。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_970');"><p>"Good man!" The king clapped him on the shoulder. "I’ve half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going."
</p></origin><translate id="div_970" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“说得好！”国王拍拍他肩膀，“我还真想丢下他们，就这样骑下去呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_971');"><p>A smile touched Ned’s lips. "I do believe you mean it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_971" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一抹笑意浮上奈德嘴角。“我相信您是认真的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_972');"><p>"I do, I do," the king said. "What do you say, Ned? Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmer’s daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_972" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那当然，那当然。”国王道，“奈德，你觉得怎样？就咱两个游侠骑士仗剑闯江湖，兵来将挡，水来土淹。晚上便找个农夫女儿或是酒店侍女帮咱们温床。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_973');"><p>"Would that we could," Ned said, "but we have duties now, my liege?.?.?.?to the realm, to our children, I to my lady wife and you to your queen. We are not the boys we were."
</p></origin><translate id="div_973" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“果真如此倒好，”奈德说，“但是陛下，如今我们有责任在身……不只是对整个王国，更要对我们的子女负责，何况我有我的夫人，您有您的王后，我们已经不再是当年的年轻小伙了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_974');"><p>"You were never the boy you were," Robert grumbled. "More’s the pity. And yet there was that one time?.?.?.?what was her name, that common girl of yours? Becca? No, she was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them. Yours was?.?.?.? Aleena? No. You told me once. Was it Merryl? You know the one I mean, your bastard’s mother?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_974" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你小子从来也没年轻过，”劳勃咕哝，“也罢。不过有那么一回……你那小妞儿叫什么来着？蓓卡？不对，她是我的，老天保佑她，那头黑亮秀发和甜美的大眼睛，一不小心就教人难以自拔。你那个叫……雅莉娜？你跟我提过一次，还是叫梅莉儿？你知道我说的哪一个吧？就你私生子的娘。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_975');"><p>"Her name was Wylla," Ned replied with cool courtesy, "and I would sooner not speak of her."
</p></origin><translate id="div_975" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她叫薇拉。”奈德有礼却冷冷说，“我不想谈她。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_976');"><p>"Wylla. Yes." The king grinned. "She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, even for an hour. You never told me what she looked like?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_976" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对，就叫薇拉。”劳勃嘿嘿直笑，“能让艾德•史塔克公爵暂时忘却荣誉，即使只是短短一个小时，她一定不是个简单的姑娘。你倒是一直没告诉我她生什么模样……？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_977');"><p>Ned’s mouth tightened in anger. "Nor will I. Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you bear me. I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men."
</p></origin><translate id="div_977" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德愤怒地抿嘴道：“以后也不会告诉你。劳勃，不要再说了，就算是看在我俩的情分上罢。我当着诸神和世人的面羞辱了我自己，也羞辱了凯特琳。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_978');"><p>"Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn."
</p></origin><translate id="div_978" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸神在上，你那时根本就没跟凯特琳见几次面。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_979');"><p>"I had taken her to wife. She was carrying my child."
</p></origin><translate id="div_979" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我已娶她为妻，她也怀了我的孩子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_980');"><p>"You are too hard on yourself, Ned. You always were. Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed." He slapped a hand on his knee. "Well, I’ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times you’re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil."
</p></origin><translate id="div_980" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“奈德，你律己太严了。你老是这德行，他妈的，不会有女人想跟圣贝勒上床的。”他拍了拍膝盖，“算了，既然你不想说，我也不勉强。但有时候看你浑身带刺，我觉得你真该拿刺猬来当家徽。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_981');"><p>The rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn. A wide plain spread out beneath them, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long, low hummocks. Ned pointed them out to his king. "The barrows of the First Men."
</p></origin><translate id="div_981" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>东升旭日的金黄指头探进清晨的朦胧白雾，一片辽阔原野在两人眼前展开，其中除了长而低缓的零星小丘，尽是片片光秃秃的褐色平地。奈德指给国王看，“这里就是 ‘先民坟冢’。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_982');"><p>Robert frowned. "Have we ridden onto a graveyard?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_982" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃皱眉道：“我们骑到坟墓堆里来了吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_983');"><p>"There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace," Ned told him. "This land is old."
</p></origin><translate id="div_983" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“陛下，北方辫地都是坟墓啊。”奈德告诉他，“这是块古老的土地。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_984');"><p>"And cold," Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. The guard had reined up well behind them, at the bottom of the ridge. "Well, I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard. There was a rider in the night, from Lord Varys in King’s Landing. Here." The king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to Ned.
</p></origin><translate id="div_984" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“也是个冷死人的地方。”劳勃拉紧斗篷埋怨道，随从在他们后方停缰勒马，停在山脊上。 “也罢，我把你找到这里可不是来讨论坟墓和你私生子的。昨晚瓦里斯伯爵差人从君临送了封信来，喏。”国王从腰带上抽出一张纸递给奈德。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_985');"><p>Varys the eunuch was the king’s master of whisperers. He served Robert now as he had once served Aerys Targaryen. Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation, but the message did not concern Lady Arryn. "What is the source for this information?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_985" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>太监瓦里斯是国王的情报总管，从前服侍伊里斯•坦格利安，如今改事劳勃。奈德畏惧地打开卷轴，心里想起莱莎和她那骇人的控诉，所幸内容与艾林夫人无关。“这消息的来源是？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_986');"><p>"Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_986" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你还记得乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_987');"><p>"Would that I might forget him," Ned said bluntly. The Mormonts of Bear Island were an old house, proud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor. Ser Jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver. As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, his crime had dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king’s justice. Five years had passed since then.
</p></origin><translate id="div_987" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我一辈子也忘不了那家伙。”奈德脱口便道。熊岛的莫尔蒙家族历史悠久，骄傲而讲究荣誉，但他们的领地位置偏远，酷寒贫瘠。 乔拉爵士为增加收入，打算把抓到的盗猎者卖给泰洛西的奴隶贩子。由于莫尔蒙是史塔克的封臣，如此一来等于玷污了整个北方的名声。于是奈德千里迢迢西行前往熊岛，却发现乔拉早已搭船潜逃，逃到“寒冰”和国王的法律臸裁之外的番邦异地去了。事发至今一转眼已经五年。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_988');"><p>"Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile," Robert explained. "Lord Varys makes good use of him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_988" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“乔拉爵士现下人在潘托斯，正焦急地等着王家特舎好渡海回国。”劳勃解释，“瓦里斯伯爵妥善运用了这个优势。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_989');"><p>"So the slaver has become a spy," Ned said with distaste. He handed the letter back. "I would rather he become a corpse."
</p></origin><translate id="div_989" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“人口贩子这下又成了间谍？”奈德嫌恶地说，一边把信件交还。“我倒是宁愿他变成一具尸体。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_990');"><p>"Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses," Robert said. "Jorah aside, what do you make of his report?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_990" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“瓦里斯认为间谍比尸体有用得多，”劳勃道，“不过撇开乔拉不谈，你对此事有何看法？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_991');"><p>"Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Shall we send her a wedding gift?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_991" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“丹妮莉丝嫁给一个多斯拉克马王，那又如何？难不成我们该送份结婚贺礼过去？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_992');"><p>The king frowned. "A knife, perhaps. A good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_992" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王皱眉：“我看送把刀更好。一把锐利的好刀，拿在一个有胆量的人手里。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_993');"><p>Ned did not feign surprise; Robert’s hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him. He remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented Robert with the corpses of Rhaegar’s wife and children as a token of fealty. Ned had named that murder; Robert called it war. When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes, his new-made king had replied, "I see no babes. Only dragonspawn." Not even Jon Arryn had been able to calm that storm. Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south. It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna’s death, and the grief they had shared over her passing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_993" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德没有故作惊讶。劳勃对坦格利安家族的恨意几近疯狂，他至今都还记忆犹新，当年泰温•兰尼斯特献上雷加妻儿们的尸体以示效忠时，两人所发生的激烈口角。奈德认为这是谋杀，劳勃却说是战争中难免的惨剧。当他辩称年幼的王子和公主与婴儿无异时，甫登上王位的劳勃应道：“我可没看到什么婴儿，只见到恶龙的孽种。”就连琼恩•艾林也无法平息那场纷争。艾德•史塔克当天便愤然拂袖而去，独自领兵前往南方打最后的一场仗。后来是因为莱安娜的死，两人才言归于好。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_994');"><p>This time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. "Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child. You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents." It was said that Rhaegar’s little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin’s soldiers had torn him from his mother’s breast and dashed his head against a wall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_994" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但这次奈德没有发火。“陛下，她不过是个孩子，您总不会像泰温•兰尼斯特那样滥杀无辜罢？”据说他们把雷加的小女儿从床上硬拖出去受死的时候，她哭得泪眼汪汪。他的儿子根本只是个襁褓中的婴儿，但泰温公爵的手下照样把他从母亲胸膛上扯开来，一头撞死在墙上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_995');"><p>"And how long will this one remain an innocent?" Robert’s mouth grew hard. "This child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_995" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谁知道她还能天真无邪多久？”劳勃语音渐扬，“这个‘孩子’过不了多久就会张开双腿，繁殖一堆恶龙遗毒来找我麻烦了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_996');"><p>"Nonetheless," Ned said, "the murder of children?.?.?.?it would be vile?.?.?.?unspeakable?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_996" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“话虽如此，”奈德道，“但谋杀孩子却是很……令人发指……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_997');"><p>"Unspeakable?" the king roared. "What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable. The way your lord father died, that was unspeakable. And Rhaegar?.?.?.?how many times do you think he raped your sister? How many hundreds of times?" His voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him. The king jerked the reins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an angry finger at Ned. "I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then I will piss on their graves."
</p></origin><translate id="div_997" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“令人发指？”国王一声怒喝，“伊里斯对你哥哥布兰登干的那些事，那才叫令人发指。想想你先父如何惨死，那才叫令人发指。还有雷加……你觉得他强暴了你妹妹几次？干了她几百次？”他的暴跳使得鞍下坐骑不安地嘶叫起来，国王猛地一扯缰绳，教马儿安静，然后愤怒地指着奈德，“我要亲手宰掉每一个坦格利安家的人，斩尽杀绝；我要教他们像龙一样死得干净彻底，最后在他们坟上撒尿。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_998');"><p>Ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him. If the years had not quenched Robert’s thirst for revenge, no words of his would help. "You can’t get your hands on this one, can you?" he said quietly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_998" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德很清楚不能在国王气头上顶撞他。如果这么多年的时间都无法浇熄他复仇的烈焰，只怕他的话也起不了什么作用。“你没法亲手宰掉这一个，对吧？”他轻声说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_999');"><p>The king’s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. "No, gods be cursed. Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around them, and now he’s handed them over to the Dothraki. I should have had them both killed years ago, when it was easy to get at them, but Jon was as bad as you. More fool I, I listened to him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_999" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王愤恨地撇撇嘴。“是没办法，天杀的。有个操他妈的潘托斯小贩把他们兄妹俩藏在围墙后面，还派了一堆尖帽子太监看守，这会儿又把他们卖给多斯拉克人。几年前不容易杀他们的时候，我早该动手了，但琼恩跟你一样坏心眼。不过我更傻，我听了他的话。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1000');"><p>"Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1000" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“琼恩•艾林是个英明睿臹的首相。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1001');"><p>Robert snorted. The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. "This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde. What would Jon say to that?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1001" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃哼了一声。“传说这个卓戈卡奥手下有十万大军，琼恩听了会作何感想？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1002');"><p>"He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea," Ned replied calmly. "The barbarians have no ships. They hate and fear the open sea."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1002" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他会说只要多斯拉克人待在狭海对岸，即便百万大军又有何惧？”奈德平静地答道，“那些野蛮人没有船，他们对一望无际的汪洋又惧又怕。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1003');"><p>The king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. "Perhaps. There are ships to be had in the Free Cities, though. I tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage. There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for now, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1003" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王不安地在马鞍上挪了挪。“或许如此，不过自由贸易城邦有的是船。奈德，我老实告诉你，我一点也不喜欢这桩婚事。到现在王国里还有人叫我 ‘篡夺者’，你难道忘了当年有多少豪门望族起兵为坦格利安家族而战吗？他们现在按兵不动，但要是逮着机会，等不及要取我和我儿子的性命哪！倘若哪天这乞丐国王带着多斯拉克大军渡海而来，这些叛徒一定会拥护他。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1004');"><p>"He will not cross," Ned promised. "And if by some mischance he does, we will throw him back into the sea. Once you choose a new Warden of the East..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1004" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他渡不了海的。”奈德保证，“就算他真来了，我们也能协力把他赶回去。等你任命好新的东境守护——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1005');"><p>The king groaned. "For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden. I know the boy is your nephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1005" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王呻吟道：“我说最后一辫，我不会让艾林家那小毛头继任东境守护。我知道那孩子是你外甥，但现在坦格利安家和多斯拉克人上了床，我疯了才会把统领王国四分之一军队的重任交给一个体弱多病的小男孩来扛。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1006');"><p>Ned was ready for that. "Yet we still must have a Warden of the East. If Robert Arryn will not do, name one of your brothers. Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm’s End, surely."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1006" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德早知他会有此答复。“但必须有人出来担任东境守护不可。假如劳勃•艾林不足以胜任，那就让你的兄弟之一来接手罢。史坦尼斯在风息堡之围一役中已经展现出他的才能，相信他应该没问题。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1007');"><p>He let the name hang there for a moment. The king frowned and said nothing. He looked uncomfortable.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1007" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他让史坦尼斯的名字在空气中悬宕了一会儿，国王皱皱眉，没有答腔，看起来不太舒服。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1008');"><p>"That is," Ned finished quietly, watching, "unless you have already promised the honor to another."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1008" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然，”奈德轻声续道，静观其变。“倘若你已把这个职位许给了别人，那就另当别论。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1009');"><p>For a moment Robert had the grace to look startled. Just as quickly, the look became annoyance. "What if I have?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1009" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>起初劳勃露出吃惊的神色，但随即转为不悦：“假如真是这样呢？”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1011');"><p>Robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows. Ned kept pace with him. The king rode on, eyes straight ahead. "Yes," he said at last. A single hard word to end the matter.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1011" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃一夹马肚，朝山瘠下的荒冢驰去，奈德紧随在旁。国王径自骑行，两眼直视前方。“对。”最后他总算开了口，仿佛要用这一个字来结束议题。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1012');"><p>"Kingslayer," Ned said. The rumors were true, then. He rode on dangerous ground now, he knew. "An able and courageous man, no doubt," he said carefully, "but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man should hold both East and West." He left unsaid his real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1012" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“弑君者。”奈德道。这么说来，所有的谣言都属实了。他很清楚自己此刻措辞务必小心谨慎。“他有能力，也不缺勇气，这毋庸置疑。”他小心翼翼地说，“但是劳勃，他父亲是世袭的西境守护，詹姆爵士迟早要继承父职，东西诸国的大权不应落入同一个人手里。”他没把真正想说的话说出来：如此一来王国一半的兵力将会落入兰尼斯特家族的手中。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1013');"><p>"I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field," the king said stubbornly. "At the moment, Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon. Don’t vex me about this, Ned, the stone has been set."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1013" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“等敌人出现了再打也不迟，”国王执拗地说，“眼下泰温公爵好端端地待在凯岩城，我想詹姆还不至于太快继承职位。奈德，这事儿别跟我争，说出去的话，覆水难收了。”

</p></origin><translate id="div_1018" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当年他的生死荣辱不也全维系在伊里斯•坦格利安身上？”奈德不客气地指出。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1019');"><p>"Why should I mistrust him? He has done everything I have ever asked of him. His sword helped win the throne I sit on."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1019" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我有什么理由不信任他？我叫他办的事他没有一次让我失望，就连我现在的王位都是靠他的宝剑赢来的咧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1020');"><p>His sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his lips. "He swore a vow to protect his king’s life with his own. Then he opened that king’s throat with a sword."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1020" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>正是他的宝剑玷污了你的王位啊，奈德心想，但没让自己说出口。“他发誓以性命守护国王，结果却一剑割了国王的喉咙。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1021');"><p>"Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!" Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow. "If Jaime hadn’t done it, it would have been left for you or me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1021" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“妈的，总得有人动手吧？”劳勃道，他在一座古老的荒坟边勒住马缰。“要是他没杀掉伊里斯，那么不是你杀就是我杀。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1022');"><p>"We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard," Ned said. The time had come for Robert to hear the whole truth, he decided then and there. "Do you remember the Trident, Your Grace?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1022" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们可不是宣誓效死的御林铁卫。”奈德道，当下他决定是该让劳勃听听实话的时候了。 “陛下，您可还记得三叉戟河之战？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1023');"><p>"I won my crown there. How should I forget it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1023" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我头上的王冠就是在那儿挣来的，怎么可能忘记？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1024');"><p>"You took a wound from Rhaegar," Ned reminded him. "So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands. The remnants of Rhaegar’s army fled back to King’s Landing. We followed. Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists. I expected to find the gates closed to us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1024" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您在和雷加的决斗中负了伤，”奈德提醒他，“因此当坦格利安军溃散后，您将追击的任务托付于我。雷加的残兵逃回君临，我们尾随而至。伊里斯和几千名死士守在红堡，我本以为城门一定是紧紧关闭。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1025');"><p>Robert gave an impatient shake of his head. "Instead you found that our men had already taken the city. What of it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1025" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃不耐烦地摇头接口：“结果你发现我们的人已经占领了城堡，那又如何？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1026');"><p>"Not our men," Ned said patiently. "Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts, not the crowned stag. And they had taken the city by treachery."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1026" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不是我们的人，”奈德耐着性子，“是兰尼斯特家的人。当时城垛上飘扬的是兰尼斯特家族的怒吼雄狮，并非宝冠雄鹿。城池乃是他们靠诡计夺下的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1027');"><p>The war had raged for close to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to Robert’s banners; others had remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters of Casterly Rock, the Wardens of the West, had remained aloof from the struggle, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of King’s Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. So the mad king had ordered his last mad act. He had opened his city to the lions at the gate.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1027" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当时战火已经蔓烧将近一年，大小贵族纷纷投至劳勃旗下，也有不少仍旧忠于坦格利安家族。势力庞大，世代担任西境守护的凯岩城兰尼斯特家族，却始终远离战场，不理会叛党和保王人士的呼唤。最后，当泰温•兰尼斯特公爵亲率一万两千精兵出现在君临城下，表示勤王意图时，伊里斯•坦格利安想必以为自己命不该绝罢。于是疯狂的国王下了他最后一道疯狂的命令，大开城门，引狮入室。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1028');"><p>"Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well," Robert said. The anger was building in him again. "Lannister paid them back in kind. It was no less than they deserved. I shall not trouble my sleep over it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1028" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“坦格利安同样也与诡计为伍，”劳勃道，他的怒气又渐渐升起。“兰尼斯特不过是以其人之道，还治其人之身罢了。天要亡坦格利安，他们死不足惜。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1029');"><p>"You were not there," Ned said, bitterness in his voice. Troubled sleep was no stranger to him. He had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at night. "There was no honor in that conquest."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1029" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你当时并不在场，”奈德语带苦涩。这个谎言已经伴随他十四年，至今仍时常在梦中骚扰他。“那场仗毫无荣誉可言。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1030');"><p>"The Others take your honor!" Robert swore. "What did any Targaryen ever know of honor? Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon’s honor!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1030" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“去你妈的荣誉！”劳勃破口大骂，“坦格利安懂什么狗屁荣誉？去你老家墓窖里问问莱安娜，问她什么叫恶龙的荣誉！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1031');"><p>"You avenged Lyanna at the Trident," Ned said, halting beside the king. Promise me, Ned, she had whispered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1031" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“三叉戟河一役，你已经为她报了仇。”奈德在国王身旁停下马。奈德，答应我，当年，她死前如此低语。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1032');"><p>"That did not bring her back." Robert looked away, off into the grey distance. "The gods be damned. It was a hollow victory they gave me. A crown?.?.?.?it was the girl I prayed them for. Your sister, safe?.?.?.?and mine again, as she was meant to be. I ask you, Ned, what good is it to wear a crown? The gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1032" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“却不能让她起死回生，”劳勃别转头去，望向灰暗的远方。“诸神都该死，我只求得到你妹妹，他们却硬塞给我一顶狗屁王冠……赢得战争又如何？我只要她平平安安……重回我的怀抱，一切都和原本一样。奈德，我问你，当国王有什么好？管你是国王还是放牛郎，诸神不都一样嘲弄你么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1033');"><p>"I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace?.?.?.?only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day," Ned said. "Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. Lannister’s men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion’s head. How he glittered!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1033" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“陛下，我没法替神灵回答您的问题……我只知道当我骑马进入红堡大厅时，”奈德道，“伊里斯倒卧血泊，墙上龙骨冷冷地看着他。四处都是兰尼斯特的手下，詹姆穿着亮金战甲，外罩御林铁卫的白披风，还有金色的宝剑，那景象直到现在还历历在目。他坐在铁王座上，高耸于众武士之中，狮头面罩下，威风凛凛，好不意气风发！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1034');"><p>"This is well known," the king complained.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1034" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是众人皆知的事嘛！”国王抱怨。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1035');"><p>"I was still mounted. I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls. It felt as though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. His golden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a king’s blood. My men were filling the room behind me. Lannister’s men drew back. I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited. At last Jaime laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, ‘Have no fear, Stark. I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It’s not a very comfortable seat, I’m afraid.’ "
</p></origin><translate id="div_1035" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当时我人在马上，骑进正殿，穿过一排排巨龙颅骨，我有种感觉，仿佛他们正看着我。最后我停在王座之前，抬头望他。他把黄金宝剑横陈于大腿之上，国王的血从剑尖不断滴落。这时我的人也涌进大厅，兰尼斯特的部队则不断后退。我半个字也没说，只静静地盯着他坐在王位上的模样，耐心等待。最后他笑着站起来，摘下头盔对我说：‘史塔克，可别瞎担心哟，我只是先帮咱们劳勃暖暖位子罢了。不过这把椅子恐怕坐起来不大舒服哪！’”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1036');"><p>The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. "You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?" He shook with laughter again. "Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. Scarce more than a boy."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1036" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王仰头大笑，笑声惊起栖息在附近棕褐长草丛里的乌鸦群，它们嘎嘎惊叫，振翅腾空。“只因为兰尼斯特那小子在我的王位上坐了几分钟，你就叫我别信任他？”他再度放声狂笑，“得了罢，奈德，詹姆当年才十七岁，还是个大孩子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1037');"><p>"Boy or man, he had no right to that throne."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1037" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不管他是孩子还是成人，都无权坐上王位。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1038');"><p>"Perhaps he was tired," Robert suggested. "Killing kings is weary work. Gods know, there’s no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room. And he spoke truly, it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair. In more ways than one." The king shook his head. "Well, now I know Jaime’s dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten. I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state, Ned. It’s all as tedious as counting coppers. Come, let’s ride, you used to know how. I want to feel the wind in my hair again." He kicked his horse back into motion 	galloped up over the barrow, raining earth down behind him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1038" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“或许他累了，”劳勃帮他开脱，“杀国王可不是件轻松差事，那该死的大厅里又没别的地方摆屁股。其实，他说的一点不错，不管从哪方面来看，那都是张既狰狞又不舒服的椅子。”国王摇摇头，“好了，如今我知道詹姆不为人知的恶行了，以后就忘了此事。奈德，我对管理国政和机心巧诈实在反胃透顶，全是些跟数铜板没两样的无聊事。来，咱们来好好骑上一段，你从前可是很会骑马的，咱们再尝尝大风在发梢奔驰的爽劲儿。”说完他再度策马前驱，扬长而去，越过坟冢，马蹄在身后溅起如雨泥花。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1039');"><p>For a moment Ned did not follow. He had run out of words, and he was filled with a vast sense of helplessness. Not for the first time, he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come. He was no Jon Arryn, to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom. Robert would do what he pleased, as he always had, and nothing Ned could say or do would change that. He belonged in Winterfell. He belonged with Catelyn in her grief, and with Bran.
