</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3685');"><p>The eastern sky was rose and gold as the sun broke over the Vale of Arryn. Catelyn Stark watched the light spread, her hands resting on the delicate carved stone of the balustrade outside her window. Below her the world turned from black to indigo to green as dawn crept across fields and forests. Pale white mists rose off Alyssa’s Tears, where the ghost waters plunged over the shoulder of the mountain to begin their long tumble down the face of the Giant’s Lance. Catelyn could feel the faint touch of spray on her face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3685" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>天空染成玫瑰和金黄。凯特琳•史塔克双手搁在窗外雕饰华丽的栏杆上，凝望着逐渐散溢的光辉。黎明爬过田野和森林，世界在她脚下由漆黑转为靛青，再变成茵绿。幽魂般的水冲出山脊，开始它们腾涌直落巨人之枪的漫长旅程，阿莱莎之泪上白雾激荡。凯特琳隐约可以感觉水花溅到脸上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3686');"><p>Alyssa Arryn had seen her husband, her brothers, and all her children slain, and yet in life she had never shed a tear. So in death, the gods had decreed that she would know no rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale, where the men she had loved were buried. Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now, and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below. Catelyn wondered how large a waterfall her own tears would make when she died. "Tell me the rest of it," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3686" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>阿莱莎•艾林生前眼睁睁地见到丈夫、兄弟和儿女惨遭杀害，却从未掉过一滴眼泪。于是诸神谕令，死后她将泪流不止，直到流下的泪水浇灌至峡谷平原的黑色沃野，因为她所爱的人们都葬在那里。阿莱莎已经死了六千年，然而至今没有一滴河水流到谷底。凯特琳不禁揣测，等自己死后，她的泪水又会变成多大的瀑布。“还有什么消息？”她说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3687');"><p>"The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock," Ser Rodrik Cassel answered from the room behind her. "Your brother writes that he has sent riders to the Rock, demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his intent, but he has had no answer. Edmure has commanded Lord Vance and Lord Piper to guard the pass below the Golden Tooth. He vows to you that he will yield no foot of Tully land without first watering it with Lannister blood."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3687" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“弑君者正在凯岩城集结军队，”身后的房间里，罗德利克爵士回答，“您哥哥信上说他派人去凯岩城，要求泰温大人表明意图，但至今没有回应。艾德慕已命凡斯大人和派柏大人把守金牙城下的隘口，并向您发誓，他决不放弃徒利家族的每一寸土地，若兰尼斯特敢来进犯，就用他们的血来浇灌。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3688');"><p>Catelyn turned away from the sunrise. Its beauty did little to lighten her mood; it seemed cruel for a day to dawn so fair and end so foul as this one promised to. "Edmure has sent riders and made vows," she said, "but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun. What of my lord father?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3688" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳移开视线，不再观看日出。朝阳再美，也难以振奋她的心绪。想到一日之始如此美丽，却注定将以惨剧收场，她愈发感慨造物者的残酷。“艾德慕派了人也发了誓，”她说，“但他不是奔流城公爵。我父亲大人有消息吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3689');"><p>"The message made no mention of Lord Hoster, my lady." Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. They had grown in white as snow and bristly as a thornbush while he was recovering from his wounds; he looked almost himself again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3689" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，信上没提到霍斯特大人。”罗德利克爵士捻捻胡须。他养伤期间，胡子又重新色白如雪，林立如丛。现在的他，模样与从前几无二致了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3690');"><p>"My father would not have given the defense of Riverrun over to Edmure unless he was very sick," she said, worried. "I should have been woken as soon as this bird arrived."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3690" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“父亲若非病重，决不会把奔流的防务交给艾德慕。”她忧心忡忡地说，“鸟儿捎信来的时候，你应该立刻叫醒我才对。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3691');"><p>"Your lady sister thought it better to let you sleep, Maester Colemon told me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3691" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“柯蒙学士告诉我，您妹妹想让您好好休息。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3692');"><p>"I should have been woken," she insisted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3692" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“应该叫醒我。”她坚持。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3693');"><p>"The maester tells me your sister planned to speak with you after the combat," Ser Rodrik said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3693" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“学士他还说，您妹妹准备在比武之后再和您谈谈。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3694');"><p>"Then she still plans to go through with this mummer’s farce?" Catelyn grimaced. "The dwarf has played her like a set of pipes, and she is too deaf to hear the tune. Whatever happens this morning, Ser Rodrik, it is past time we took our leave. My place is at Winterfell with my sons. If you are strong enough to travel, I shall ask Lysa for an escort to see us to Gulltown. We can take ship from there."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3694" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这么说来，她真打算把这出闹剧演下去？”凯特琳皱眉。“那侏儒拿她当笛子吹，她自己还蒙在鼓里。罗德利克爵士，无论今天早上结果如何，我们都该动身。我的职责是在临冬城陪伴儿子们。假如你体力还撑得住，我这就请莱莎派人护送我们到海鸥镇，我们从那里搭船回去。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3695');"><p>"Another ship?" Ser Rodrik looked a shade green, yet he managed not to shudder. "As you say, my lady."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3695" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“又要坐船？”罗德利克脸色发青，但还是忍耐住没有发抖。“夫人，就照您吩咐。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3696');"><p>The old knight waited outside her door as Catelyn summoned the servants Lysa had given her. If she spoke to her sister before the duel, perhaps she could change her mind, she thought as they dressed her. Lysa’s policies varied with her moods, and her moods changed hourly. The shy girl she had known at Riverrun had grown into a woman who was by turns proud, fearful, cruel, dreamy, reckless, timid, stubborn, vain, and, above all, inconstant.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3696" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳唤来莱莎派给她差遣的仆人，老骑士则候在门外。她一边更衣，一边想着如果赶在决斗开始前与妹妹谈谈，或许能让她改变心意。莱莎行事全依心情而定，偏偏她的个性又阴晴不定。她所认识的，昔日奔流城那位羞怯少女，已经长成了时而傲慢，时而忧惧，又或残忍，甚至空幻不切实际，粗心大意、怯懦怕事、好大喜功的妇人，最糟糕的是她还变化无常。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3697');"><p>When that vile turnkey of hers had come crawling to tell them that Tyrion Lannister wished to confess, Catelyn had urged Lysa to have the dwarf brought to them privately, but no, nothing would do but that her sister must make a show of him before half the Vale. And now this?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_3697" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当初她那阴狠的狱吏连走带爬，跑来告诉她们提利昂•兰尼斯特有意认罪，凯特琳便力劝莱莎私下会审侏儒，然而妹妹非得在峡谷贵族面前大肆炫耀一番不可，结果竟演变至此…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3698');"><p>"Lannister is my prisoner," she told Ser Rodrik as they descended the tower stairs and made their way through the Eyrie’s cold white halls. Catelyn wore plain grey wool with a silvered belt. "My sister must be reminded of that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3698" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“兰尼斯特是我的犯人，”他们步上高塔楼梯，朝鹰巢城冰冷苍白的大厅走去时，她这么对罗德利克爵士说。凯特琳穿了一件朴素的灰羊毛外衣，系上一条镀银的腰带。“我妹妹不能忘记这点。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3699');"><p>At the doors to Lysa’s apartments, they met her uncle storming out. "Going to join the fool’s festival?" Ser Brynden snapped. "I’d tell you to slap some sense into your sister, if I thought it would do any good, but you’d only bruise your hand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3699" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们在莱莎居所外遇见叔叔怒气冲冲地冲出来。“这群傻瓜过节呢，你也去干嘛？”布林登爵士斥道，“本来我想叫你甩你妹妹两个耳光，把她打清醒，可这没用，你只会打痛自己的手。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3700');"><p>"There was a bird from Riverrun," Catelyn began, "a letter from Edmure?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3700" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有只鸟儿从奔流城过来，”凯特琳开口，“艾德慕写信……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3701');"><p>"I know, child." The black fish that fastened his cloak was Brynden’s only concession to ornament. "I had to hear it from Maester Colemon. I asked your sister for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and ride for Riverrun with all haste. Do you know what she told me? The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords, nor even one, Uncle, she said. You are the Knight of the Gate. Your place is here." A gust of childish laughter drifted through the open doors behind him, and her uncle glanced darkly over his shoulder. "Well, I told her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate. Black fish or no, I am still a Tully. I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3701" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“孩子，我知道，”布林登斗篷上的黑鱼，是他全身上下惟一称得上装饰的东西。“我从柯蒙师傅那儿听到了消息。我请你妹妹拨给我一千精兵，火速驰援奔流城，结果你知道她说了些什么？她说‘叔叔，鹰巢城的守军少不了一个，更别提一千，再说你是血门骑士，理应留守于此。’”他身后敞开的大门内传出一阵充满臻气的笑声，叔叔沉着脸回头看了一眼。“好吧，反正我告诉她大可再找个新的血门骑士。无论我是不是黑鱼，我到底是徒利家的人。今天傍晚我就回奔流城。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3702');"><p>Catelyn could not pretend to surprise. "Alone? You know as well as I that you will never survive the high road. Ser Rodrik and I are returning to Winterfell. Come with us, Uncle. I will give you your thousand men. Riverrun will not fight alone."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3702" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳难掩惊讶之情。“就你一个人？你我都很清楚一个人走山路根本是找死。正好罗德利克爵士和我也准备回临冬城去。叔叔，跟我们一道走罢，那一千精兵我来给。奔流城绝不会孤军作战。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3703');"><p>Brynden thought a moment, then nodded a brusque agreement. "As you say. It’s the long way home, but I’m more like to get there. I’ll wait for you below." He went striding off, his cloak swirling behind him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3703" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布林登沉吟半晌，然后唐突地点点头。“那就这样。虽然是绕远路，但我抵达的机会却也比较大。我在下面等你。”说完他大跨步离去，披风在背后飘荡。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3704');"><p>Catelyn exchanged a look with Ser Rodrik. They went through the doors to the high, nervous sound of a child’s giggles.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3704" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳与罗德利克爵士交换了个眼色，接着穿过大门，朝那一片高亢尖锐，却又焦虑不安的孩童嘻笑声走去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3705');"><p>Lysa’s apartments opened over a small garden, a circle of dirt and grass planted with blue flowers and ringed on all sides by tall white towers. The builders had intended it as a godswood, but the Eyrie rested on the hard stone of the mountain, and no matter how much soil was hauled up from the Vale, they could not get a weirwood to take root here. So the Lords of the Eyrie planted grass and scattered statuary amidst low, flowering shrubs. It was there the two champions would meet to place their lives, and that of Tyrion Lannister, into the hands of the gods.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3705" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱莎的居所位于一座小花园之上，花园呈圆圈状，白色高塔环绕四周。花园的泥土和青草上种植着蓝色花朵，当初工匠的原意是要栽培神木林，然而鹰巢城立基于山巅坚硬的磐石之上，无论自艾林谷运来多少沃壤，依旧不能让鱼梁木在此生根茁长。于是历任公爵改种草坪，并在花朵繁茂的矮树丛间放置雕像。两位决斗者与提利昂•兰尼斯特的性命，便将在此交付天上诸神，做出最后决断。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3706');"><p>Lysa, freshly scrubbed and garbed in cream velvet with a rope of sapphires and moonstones around her milk-white neck, was holding court on the terrace overlooking the scene of the combat, surrounded by her knights, retainers, and lords high and low. Most of them still hoped to wed her, bed her, and rule the Vale of Arryn by her side. From what Catelyn had seen during her stay at the Eyrie, it was a vain hope.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3706" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱莎刚梳洗完毕，换了身奶油色的天鹅绒外衣，乳白的颈项间戴了一串青玉和月长石，这时正在露天阳台上主持集会。该处视野恰好可将决斗过程尽收眼底，莱莎身边围满了随从、骑士、以及大小领主。其中大部分人依旧怀着希望，想娶她睡她，然后与她并肩统治艾林谷。但就凯特琳这些天来在鹰巢城所见判断，他们的希望不大。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3707');"><p>A wooden platform had been built to elevate Robert’s chair; there the Lord of the Eyrie sat, giggling and clapping his hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blue-and-white motley made two wooden knights hack and slash at each other. Pitchers of thick cream and baskets of blackberries had been set out, and the guests were sipping a sweet orange-scented wine from engraved silver cups. A fool’s festival, Brynden had called it, and small wonder.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3707" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃坐在高高的椅子上，座位下方搭了个木台，眼前有个穿着蓝白弄臣服的驼背木偶师，正操纵两个木头骑士相互砍杀，逗得鹰巢城公爵咯咯直笑，不停鼓掌。阳台上摆了一罐罐浓乳酪，以及一篮篮黑莓，宾客们正手拿雕花银杯，啜饮一种掺了橙香的甜葡萄酒。傻瓜过节，难怪布林登这么说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3708');"><p>Across the terrace, Lysa laughed gaily at some jest of Lord Hunter’s, and nibbled a blackberry from the point of Ser Lyn Corbray’s dagger. They were the suitors who stood highest in Lysa’s favor?.?.?.?today, at least. Catelyn would have been hard-pressed to say which man was more unsuitable. Eon Hunter was even older than Jon Arryn had been, half-crippled by gout, and cursed with three quarrelsome sons, each more grasping than the last. Ser Lyn was a different sort of folly; lean and handsome, heir to an ancient but impoverished house, but vain, reckless, hot-tempered?.?.?.?and, it was whispered, notoriously uninterested in the intimate charms of women.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3708" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>阳台上，杭特伯爵说了个笑话，引得莱莎开怀大笑，然后她又从林恩•科布瑞爵士的匕首上咬过一颗黑莓。众位追求者中，便数他俩最得莱莎欢心……至少，今天的情形是如此。若问凯特琳他们谁比较不适合，她还真无从答起。伊恩•杭特的年纪比琼恩•艾林更大，害了痛风，走起路来有些跛，膝下还有三个争吵不休的儿子，一个比一个贪婪。林恩爵士则是另一番荒唐相，他苗条英俊，是古老而衰败的科布瑞家族的继承人，但他性好虚荣，脾气暴躁，行事又不加思考……有人更谣传，他对男女之间的亲密关系出了名的没兴趣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3709');"><p>When Lysa espied Catelyn, she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on the cheek. "Isn’t it a lovely morning? The gods are smiling on us. Do try a cup of the wine, sweet sister. Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it, from his own cellars."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3709" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱莎远远望见凯特琳，立即起身热情拥抱，还在她颊上印下湿湿一吻。“早上天气可真好，你说是不是？天上诸神都在对我们微笑呢。亲爱的姐姐，快尝尝这酒，这是杭特大人特意从他自家酒窖里送来的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3710');"><p>"Thank you, no. Lysa, we must talk."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3710" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谢谢，不用了。莱莎，我要跟你谈谈。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3711');"><p>"After," her sister promised, already beginning to turn away from her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3711" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“等下再说。”妹妹刚出口保证，就转身准备离开。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3712');"><p>"Now." Catelyn spoke more loudly than she’d intended. Men were turning to look. "Lysa, you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly. Alive, the Imp has value. Dead, he is only food for crows. And if his champion should prevail here..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3712" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“现在要谈。”凯特琳不自觉地提高音量，引来旁人转头观望。“莱莎，你不能这样胡闹下去。小恶魔活着才有价值，死了就只能喂乌鸦。若是他的代理骑士打赢——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3713');"><p>"Small chance of that, my lady," Lord Hunter assured her, patting her shoulder with a liver-spotted hand. "Ser Vardis is a doughty fighter. He will make short work of the sellsword."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3713" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，我看没这可能。”杭特爵士伸出布满老人斑的手拍拍她肩膀，向她保证。 “瓦狄斯爵士武艺超群，三两下便可把那佣兵解决掉。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3714');"><p>"Will he, my lord?" Catelyn said coolly. "I wonder." She had seen Bronn fight on the high road; it was no accident that he had survived the journey while other men had died. He moved like a panther, and that ugly sword of his seemed a part of his arm.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3714" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，你就这么有把握？”凯特琳冷冷地说，“我可不敢说。”她在山路上亲眼见识过波隆的身手，他之所以能活到现在，绝非偶然。他行动灵敏宛如猎豹，那柄丑陋的剑更仿佛与他手臂合为一体。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3715');"><p>Lysa’s suitors were gathering around them like bees round a blossom. "Women understand little of these things," Ser Morton Waynwood said. "Ser Vardis is a knight, sweet lady. This other fellow, well, his sort are all cowards at heart. Useful enough in a battle, with thousands of their fellows around them, but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3715" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱莎的追求者们纷纷聚集过来，如同围绕花朵的蜜蜂。“女人家哪懂这种事？”莫顿•韦伍德爵士道，“亲爱的夫人，瓦狄斯爵士乃堂堂骑士。至于那家伙嘛，呵，他那种人骨子里都是懦夫。打仗的时候，几千个聚在一起，还管点用，可叫他一对一与人单打独斗，谅他没这能耐。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3716');"><p>"Say you have the truth of it, then," Catelyn said with a courtesy that made her mouth ache. "What will we gain by the dwarf’s death? Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3716" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就算是这样，”凯特琳硬装出来的礼貌口吻，连自己都受不了。“敢问侏儒死了对我们有何好处？只要我们把他丢下山崖，您觉得詹姆会在乎我们有没有事先举行审判吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3717');"><p>"Behead the man," Ser Lyn Corbray suggested. "When the Kingslayer receives the Imp’s head, it will be a warning to him,"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3717" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“干脆把他脑袋砍了，”林恩•科布瑞爵士提议，“再把首级送给弑君者，当作给他的警告。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3718');"><p>Lysa gave an impatient shake of her waist-long auburn hair. "Lord Robert wants to see him fly," she said, as if that settled the matter. "And the Imp has only himself to blame. It was he who demanded a trial by combat."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3718" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱莎不耐烦地甩甩及腰的红棕长发。“劳勃大人想要看他飞，”她的语气仿佛在为这场争执划下句点。“要怪也只能怪小恶魔自己，当初要求比武审判的也是他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3719');"><p>"Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him, even if she’d wished to," Lord Hunter intoned ponderously.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3719" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“即使莱莎夫人想拒绝，也无法在兼顾礼数的前提下办到。”杭特伯爵语气沉重地发言。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3720');"><p>Ignoring them all, Catelyn turned all her force on her sister. "I remind you, Tyrion Lannister is my prisoner."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3720" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳不理睬他们，把所有的力气都用来对付妹妹。“容我提醒你，提利昂•兰尼斯特是我的犯人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3721');"><p>"And I remind you, the dwarf murdered my lord husband!" Her voice rose. "He poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless, and now I mean to see him pay!" Whirling, her skirts swinging around her, Lysa stalked across the terrace. Ser Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors excused themselves with cool nods and trailed after her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3721" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“让我也提醒你，侏儒谋害的是我丈夫！”她提高音量。“他毒害了国王的首相，让我宝贝小小年纪就没了父亲，现在我要他付出代价！”莱莎旋身，裙裾跟着飞扬，她昂首阔步地走到阳台的一边。林恩爵士、莫顿爵士和其他追求者冷冰冰地点头致意，跟在她身后离去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3722');"><p>"Do you think he did?" Ser Rodrik asked her quietly when they were alone again. "Murder Lord Jon, that is? The Imp still denies it, and most fiercely?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3722" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您认为真的是他干的吗？”只剩他们俩后，罗德利克爵士悄声问她。“谋害琼恩大人的事，是真的吗？小恶魔始终否认，坚决否认……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3723');"><p>"I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn," Catelyn replied, "but whether it was Tyrion, or Ser Jaime, or the queen, or all of them together, I could not begin to say." Lysa had named Cersei in the letter she had sent to Winterfell, but now she seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer?.?.?.?perhaps because the dwarf was here, while the queen was safe behind the walls of the Red Keep, hundreds of leagues to the south. Catelyn almost wished she had burned her sister’s letter before reading it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3723" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我相信谋害艾林大人的是兰尼斯特家的人，”凯特琳回答：“但究竟是提利昂，还是詹姆爵士，抑或王后，甚至三人都有份，我就不敢说了。”当初莱莎送到临冬城的信上指称瑟曦为凶手，而现在她似乎又认定提利昂才是真凶……这难道因为侏儒近在眼前，王后却在好几百里格以外的南方，安全地躲在红堡高墙之后？凯特琳不禁希望自己当初在没拆信之前，就先把它烧掉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3724');"><p>Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. "Poison, well?.?.?.?that could be the dwarf’s work, true enough. Or Cersei’s. It’s said poison is a woman’s weapon, begging your pardons, my lady. The Kingslayer, now?.?.?.?I have no great liking for the man, but he’s not the sort. Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his. Was it poison, my lady?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3724" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗德利克爵士捻捻胡须。“若用毒药，那么……的确有可能是侏儒下的手，或者瑟曦。夫人，我无意冒犯，但人们不都说毒药是女人的武器吗？至于弑君者，呃……我对此人无甚好感，但他不像是会做这种事的人。他太喜欢看自己那把黄金宝剑染血了。夫人，真的是用毒药？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3725');"><p>Catelyn frowned, vaguely uneasy. "How else could they make it look a natural death?"

Petyr had begged her for a favor he might wear, but she had turned him away. Her lord father promised her to Brandon Stark, and so it was to him that she gave her token, a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun. As she pressed it into his hand, she pleaded with him. "He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother. It would grieve me to see him die."

When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon finally ended it, with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr’s rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs, so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal.

Her brother had acted as Brandon’s squire at the duel, and Littlefinger would not forgive that.

One moment he was reeling backward, half-crouched behind his scarred shield; the next he charged. The sudden bull rush caught Bronn off balance. Ser Vardis crashed into him and slammed the lip of his shield into the sellsword’s face. Almost, almost, Bronn lost his feet?.?.?.?he staggered back, tripped over a rock, and caught hold of the weeping woman to keep his balance. Throwing aside his shield, Ser Vardis lurched after him, using both hands to raise his sword. His right arm was blood from elbow to fingers now, yet his last desperate blow would have opened Bronn from neck to navel?.?.?.?if the sellsword had stood to receive it.

Jon Arryn’s beautiful engraved silver sword glanced off the marble elbow of the weeping woman and snapped clean a third of the way up the blade. Bronn put his shoulder into the statue’s back. The weathered likeness of Alyssa Arryn tottered and fell with a great crash, and Ser Vardis Egen went down beneath her.

Ser Vardis was lying on his side, pinned beneath the broken torso of the weeping woman. Catelyn heard the knight groan as the sellsword lifted his blade with both hands and drove it down and in with all his weight behind it, under the arm and through the ribs. Ser Vardis Egen shuddered and lay still.

"I believe we know the way."
