</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6762');"><p>The land was red and dead and parched, and good wood was hard to come by. Her foragers returned with gnarled cottonwoods, purple brush, sheaves of brown grass. They took the two straightest trees, hacked the limbs and branches from them, skinned off their bark, and split them, laying the logs in a square. Its center they filled with straw, brush, bark shavings, and bundles of dry grass. Rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to them; he was not the equal of Khal Drogo’s red, but few horses were. In the center of the square, Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6762" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>此地辫野红沙，四下死寂，干枯焦裂，木柴难寻。 她手下的人带回纠结的绵木、紫灌木以及束束褐草。他们还找来两棵生得最直的树，砍下树枝，剥去树皮，然后将之劈开，把所得木柴堆成方形，中间放满稻草、灌木、树皮屑和干草。拉卡洛从剩下的小马群里挑了一头骏马，虽然比不上卓戈卡奥的赤红坐骑，但世间原本就少有与之匹敌的畜生。阿戈把它牵到木柴堆成的方形中间，喂它吃了一颗干瘪的苹果，然后照它面门一斧砍去，利落地把它放倒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6763');"><p>Bound hand and foot, Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes. "It is not enough to kill a horse," she told Dany. "By itself, the blood is nothing. You do not have the words to make a spell, nor the wisdom to find them. Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children? You call me maegi as if it were a curse, but all it means is wise. You are a child, with a child’s ignorance. Whatever you mean to do, it will not work. Loose me from these bonds and I will help you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6763" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>弥丽•马兹•笃尔手脚被缚，站在漫漫烟尘中，睁大那双黑眼，不安地看着这一切。“杀马是不够的，”她告诉丹妮，“血液本身没有力量，你既不懂魔咒的语言，更没有寻求这种语言的臹慧。你以为血魔法是小孩子玩的把戏? 你称呼我为‘巫魔女’，仿佛那是个诅咒，但它真正的意思其实是‘臹慧’。你只是个年幼无知的孩子，无论你打算做什么，都注定不会成功。为我松绑，我会帮你。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6764');"><p>"I am tired of the maegi’s braying," Dany told Jhogo. He took his whip to her, and after that the godswife kept silent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6764" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我听够了巫魔女的废话。”丹妮对乔戈说。他取出鞭子交给她，在那之后，女祭司沉默了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6765');"><p>Over the carcass of the horse, they built a platform of hewn logs; trunks of smaller trees and limbs from the greater, and the thickest straightest branches they could find. They laid the wood east to west, from sunrise to sunset. On the platform they piled Khal Drogo’s treasures: his great tent, his painted vests, his saddles and harness, the whip his father had given him when he came to manhood, the arakh he had used to slay Khal Ogo and his son, a mighty dragonbone bow. Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo’s bloodriders had given Dany for bride gifts as well, but she forbade it. "Those are mine," she told him, "and I mean to keep them." Another layer of brush was piled about the khal’s treasures, and bundles of dried grass scattered over them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6765" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们拿柴薪在马尸上堆起一座平台，用上了小树的主干、大树的枝桠，以及所有能找到的最粗最直的枝条。他们将木柴从东摆到西，象征日升到日落，然后在平台上放置卓戈卡奥的宝物：他的大帐篷、他的彩绘背心、他的马鞍和缰绳、他成年时父亲所赠的马鞭、他那把曾击杀奥戈卡奥父子的亚拉克弯刀，还有他巨大的龙骨长弓。阿戈原本要把卓戈的血盟卫赠与丹妮作新娘礼的武器也放上去，却被她阻止。 “那些是我的东西，”她对他说，“我要留着。”卡奥的宝物上又铺了一层灌木枝条，然后放上几捆干草。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6766');"><p>Ser Jorah Mormont drew her aside as the sun was creeping toward its zenith. "Princess?.?.?.?" he began.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6766" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>太阳逐渐朝天顶爬去，乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士把她拉到一边。“公主殿下……”他开口。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6767');"><p>"Why do you call me that?" Dany challenged him. "My brother Viserys was your king, was he not?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6767" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你为何如此称呼我?”丹妮臼问他，“我哥哥韦赛里斯从前是你的国王，不是吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6768');"><p>"He was, my lady."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6768" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，小姐。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6769');"><p>"Viserys is dead. I am his heir, the last blood of House Targaryen. Whatever was his is mine now."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6769" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如今韦赛里斯死了，我就是他的继承人，是坦格利安家族的最后血脉，过去属于他的东西，现在都是我的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6770');"><p>"My?.?.?.?queen," Ser Jorah said, going to one knee. "My sword that was his is yours, Dacnerys. And my heart as well, that never belonged to your brother. I am only a knight, and I have nothing to offer you but exile, but I beg you, hear me. Let Khal Drogo go. You shall not be alone. I promise you, no man shall take you to Vaes Dothrak unless you wish to go. You need not join the dosh khaleen. Come east with me. Yi Ti, Qarth, the Jade Sea, Asshai by the Shadow. We will see all the wonders yet unseen, and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve us. Please, Khaleesi. I know what you intend. Do not. Do not."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6770" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是……女王陛下。”乔拉爵士说着单膝跪下。“丹妮莉丝，我的剑是您的，我的心也是您的——而在过去，我这颗心却不曾属于您哥哥。我仅是一介骑士，遭遇放逐，身无长物，但我求求您，听我说。让卓戈卡奥去罢，你绝不会孤身一人。我向你保证，除非你自愿，否则谁都别想带你回维斯•多斯拉克，你无须加入多希卡林。跟我走吧，我们去东方，去夷地、魁尔斯、五海和阴影之地旁的亚夏，我们将会看到前所未见的奇观，啜饮天上诸神赐予我们的玉露琼浆。我求求您，卡丽熙，我知道您的打算，但请您千万别这么做，千万不要啊。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6771');"><p>"I must," Dany told him. She touched his face, fondly, sadly. "You do not understand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6771" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我必须这么做，”丹妮一边说，一边伸出手，爱怜而哀伤地轻抚他的脸颊，“你不了解。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6772');"><p>"I understand that you loved him," Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair. "I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with her. You are my queen, my sword is yours, but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo’s pyre. I will not watch you burn."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6772" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，我了解您深爱着他，”乔拉爵士的声音里充满绝望。“过去，我也深爱着我的妻子，但我并不曾与她生死相随。您是我的女王，我的剑是您的，但你若要爬上卓戈的火葬台，休想叫我袖手旁观，我绝不能眼睁睁地看着你被火焚烧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6773');"><p>"Is that what you fear?" Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead. "I am not such a child as that, sweet ser."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6773" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你怕的就是这个?”丹妮轻轻地吻了他宽阔的额头。“好爵士，我没有孩子气到那种地步啊。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6774');"><p>"You do not mean to die with him? You swear it, my queen?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6774" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你不会陪他殉死?女王陛下，您发誓不会这么做?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6775');"><p>"I swear it," she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were hers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6775" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我发誓。”她用七大王国——那些照理归她统治的国度——的通用语答道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6776');"><p>The third level of the platform was woven of branches no thicker than a finger, and covered with dry leaves and twigs. They laid them north to south, from ice to fire, and piled them high with soft cushions and sleeping silks. The sun had begun to lower toward the west by the time they were done. Dany called the Dothraki around her. Fewer than a hundred were left. How many had Aegon started with? she wondered. It did not matter.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6776" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>平台的第三层用跟手指一般粗细的树枝搭咸，上面铺满干叶和枯枝。他们将枝叶从北摆到南，象征玄冰到烈火，最后把柔软的枕头和丝被堆在最上，积得老高。等到一切备妥，太阳已经渐渐西沉。丹妮将所剩无几、尚不满一百的多斯拉克人召集到身边。当年伊耿扬帆出征时，最初又带了多少人呢?她不禁好奇地想。多少都没有关系。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6777');"><p>"You will be my khalasar," she told them. "I see the faces of slaves. I free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one shall harm you. If you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives." The black eyes watched her, wary, expressionless. "I see the children, women, the wrinkled faces of the aged. I was a child yesterday. Today I am a woman. Tomorrow I will be old. To each of you I say, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for you." She turned to the three young warriors of her khas. "Jhogo, to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift, and name you ko, and ask your oath, that you will live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6777" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们将是我的卡拉萨。”她对他们说，“在你们当中，我看到了奴隶的脸庞，首先，我放你们自由。取下你们的奴隶项圈吧，如果你们要走，没人会加以阻止，但如果你们选择留下，你们将彼此成为兄弟姐妹、男女夫妻。”一双双黑眼睛看着她，充满戒心，面无表情。“在这里，我更看到幼儿、妇女和满是皱纹的老人的脸孔。昨天我尚为幼儿，今夕我已成为女人，明日我便将衰老。我告诉你们中每一个：把你们的双 手和你们的心灵交给我，这里永远有你们的一席之地。”她转身面对自己卡斯部众的三名年轻战士。“乔戈，这把银柄长鞭是我的新娘礼，在此我把它送给你，并任命你为寇，同时要求你宣誓成为吾血之血，与我同生共死，并肩作战，保护我免于危难。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6778');"><p>Jhogo took the whip from her hands, but his face was confused. "Khaleesi, " he said hesitantly, "this is not done. It would shame me, to be bloodrider to a woman."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6778" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔戈从她手中接过鞭子，脸上却满是困惑。“卡丽熙，”他有些犹豫地说，“这事不成的。当女人的血盟卫，会令我感到羞耻的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6779');"><p>"Aggo," Dany called, paying no heed to Jhogo’s words. If I look back I am lost. "To you I give the dragonbone bow that was my bride gift." It was double-curved, shiny black and exquisite, taller than she was. "I name you ko, and ask your oath, that you should live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6779" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“阿戈”’丹妮唤道，不理会乔戈的话。如果我回头，一切就都完了。“这把龙骨长弓是我的新娘礼，在此我把它送给你，”那把双弧龙弓，雕工精细，乌黑发亮，立起来比她还高。“我也任命你为寇，同时要求你宣誓成为吾血之血，与我同生共死，并肩作战，保护我免于危难。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6780');"><p>Aggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes. "I cannot say these words. Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6780" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>阿戈垂下眼睛，接受了那把弓。“我无法宣誓。只有男人才能领导卡拉萨，或是任命别人为寇。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6781');"><p>"Rakharo," Dany said, turning away from the refusal, "you shall have the great arakh that was my bride gift, with hilt and blade chased in gold. And you too I name my ko, and ask that you live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6781" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“拉卡洛，”丹妮不理会他的拒绝。“这把亚拉克巨弯刀是我的新娘礼，它的刀鞘和刀身都镶上了金线，在此我把它送给你，并任命你为寇，同时要求你成为吾血之血，与我同生共死，并肩作战，保护我免于危难。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6782');"><p>"You are khaleesi," Rakharo said, taking the arakh. "I shall ride at your side to Vaes Dothrak beneath the Mother of Mountains, and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the dosh khaleen. No more can I promise."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6782" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您是卡丽熙，”拉卡洛说罢接过亚拉克弯刀。“我将与您并肩骑到圣母山下的维斯•多斯拉克，保护您免于危难，直到您加入多希卡林的老妪。除此之外，我无法作任何承诺。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6783');"><p>She nodded, as calmly as if she had not heard his answer, and turned to the last of her champions. "Ser Jorah Mormont," she said, "first and greatest of my knights, I have no bride gift to give you, but I swear to you, one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen, dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel. And I would ask for your oath as well."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6783" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她冷静地点点头，仿佛压根儿没听见他的回答，然后她转身面对她的最后一名武士。“乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士，”她说，“你是追随我的第一个、也是最忠勇的骑士，我虽无新娘礼相赠，但我向你发誓，有朝一日，你将会从我手中得到一把举世无双的长剑，它将由真龙打造，以瓦雷利亚钢铸成。我也要求你宣誓效忠。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6784');"><p>"You have it, my queen," Ser Jorah said, kneeling to lay his sword at her feet. "I vow to serve you, to obey you, to die for you if need be."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6784" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“女王陛下，我的命是您的，”乔拉骑士说着单膝跪下，将佩剑放在她脚边。“我宣誓为您效力，奉行您一切旨意，牺牲性命，再所不辞。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6785');"><p>"Whatever may come?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6785" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“至死不渝?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6786');"><p>"Whatever may come."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6786" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“至死不渝。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6787');"><p>"I shall hold you to that oath. I pray you never regret the giving of it." Dany lifted him to his feet. Stretching on her toes to reach his lips, she kissed the knight gently and said, "You are the first of my Queensguard."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6787" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我将谨记你的誓言，希望你永不后悔。”丹妮扶他起身，然后垫起脚尖，轻柔地在骑士唇上印下一吻。“你是我第一个女王铁卫。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6788');"><p>She could feel the eyes of the khalasar on her as she entered her tent. The Dothraki were muttering and giving her strange sideways looks from the corners of their dark almond eyes. They thought her mad, Dany realized. Perhaps she was. She would know soon enough. If I look back I am lost.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6788" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她进帐时，感觉整个卡拉萨都在注目她。多斯拉克人窃窃私语，睁着杏仁形的黑眼睛，用眼角余光怪异地打量她。他们一定以为我疯了，丹妮明白，或许我真疯了，究竟是不是这样，很快就能揭晓。如果我回头，一切就都完了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6789');"><p>Her bath was scalding hot when Irri helped her into the tub, but Dany did not flinch or cry aloud. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Jhiqui had scented the water with the oils she had found in the market in Vaes Dothrak; the steam rose moist and fragrant. Doreah washed her hair and combed it out, working loose the mats and tangles. Irri scrubbed her back. Dany closed her eyes and let the smell and the warmth enfold her. She could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between her thighs. She shuddered when it entered her, and her pain and stiffness seemed to dissolve. She floated.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6789" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊丽搀她进入浴缸，洗澡水烫得吓人，但丹妮既未退缩，也未吭声。她喜欢这种热，让她有干净的感觉。姬琪在水里洒了香油,那是她在维斯•多斯拉克的市集里收的礼物，此刻帐篷里蒸汽四溢，馨香弥漫。多莉亚为她洗净头发，把纠缠打结的地方都梳理柔顺，伊丽则替她刷背。丹妮阖上双眼，任香气和暖意裹住全身。她可以感觉热气渗进双腿间的酸痛，当热气进入体内时，她禁不住颤抖，接着，所有的疼痛和僵硬似乎都随之融化，令她飘飘欲仙。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6790');"><p>When she was clean, her handmaids helped her from the water. Irri and Jhiqui fanned her dry, while Doreah brushed her hair until it fell like a river of liquid silver down her back. They scented her with spiceflower and cinnamon; a touch on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts. The last dab was for her sex. Irri’s finger felt as light and cool as a lover’s kiss as it slid softly up between her lips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6790" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>沐浴干净后，女仆扶她走出浴缸。伊丽和姬琪为她擦干身体，多莉亚则为她梳整头发，将她一头长发梳成银色瀑布，流泻到后背。她们为她抹上辛香花和肉桂：双腕、耳后』中胀的乳头各轻触一点，最后抹在下体。伊丽的手指轻轻滑过细部，冰凉而温柔，有如爱人的吻。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6791');"><p>Afterward, Dany sent them all away, so she might prepare Khal Drogo for his final ride into the night lands. She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair, running her fingers through it for the last time, feeling the weight of it, remembering the first time she had touched it, the night of their wedding ride. His hair had never been cut. How many men could die with their hair uncut? She buried her face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils. He smelled like grass and warm earth, like smoke and semen and horses. He smelled like Drogo. Forgive me, sun of my life, she thought. Forgive me for all I have done and all I must do. I paid the price, my star, but it was too high, too high?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6791" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在这之后，丹妮把她们都遣走，亲自帮卓戈卡奥准备前往夜晚国度的最后一趟旅程。她洗净他的身体，梳理他的头发，并为之搽上香油。她最后一次伸手滑过他的头发，感觉到它们的重量，想起新婚当晚自己初次碰触的情景。他的头发从未修剪，有多少死者有如此殊荣呢?她把脸深埋其中，吸进发油朦胧的芳香。他闻起来有青草和大地的感觉，有轻烟、精液和骏马的气息，他闻起来有卓戈的味道。我生命中的太阳，请你原谅我，她想，原谅我所做的一切，以及我必须做的一切。我的星星，我付出了代价，可这个代价实在太高、太高了……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6792');"><p>Dany braided his hair and slid the silver rings onto his mustache and hung his bells one by one. So many bells, gold and silver and bronze. Bells so his enemies would hear him coming and grow weak with fear. She dressed him in horsehair leggings and high boots, buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver medallions about his waist. Over his scarred chest she slipped a painted vest, old and faded, the one Drogo had loved best. For herself she chose loose sandsilk trousers, sandals that laced halfway up her legs, and a vest like Drogo’s.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6792" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮为他扎起发辪，把银环穿上他的胡子，又把铃铛一个个系在他发梢。这么多铃铛，其中有金、银，还有青铜，这些铃铛将向他的敌人宣告他的到来，令他们胆怯害怕。她为他穿上马鬃绑腿和高统长靴，在他腰间系上一条满是金银奖牌的沉重皮带。最后，她为他穿上彩绘背心，遮住胸膛的伤疤，这背心虽然老旧褪色，却是他最喜欢的一件。至于自己，她选了一件宽松的沙丝长裤，一双绑到膝盖的凉鞋，以及和卓戈穿的相似的背心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6793');"><p>The sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the pyre. The Dothraki watched in silence as Jhogo and Aggo bore him from the tent. Dany walked behind them. They laid him down on his cushions and silks, his head toward the Mother of Mountains far to the northeast.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6793" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当她召唤他们来把卓戈的遗体搬到火葬台上时，太阳已经快要下山。乔戈和阿戈抬着他走出帐篷，多斯拉克人在旁静默地观看。丹妮走在他们之后。他们让他躺在自己的枕头和丝被上，头朝遥远东北的圣母山。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6794');"><p>"Oil," she commanded, and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre, soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass, until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance. "Bring my eggs," Dany commanded her handmaids. Something in her voice made them run.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6794" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“拿油来。”她一声令下，他们便抱来那一罐罐香油，浇淋在火葬堆上，浸湿了丝被、树枝和捆捆干草，渗进下面的木柴，空气中弥漫着香气。“把我的蛋也拿来。”丹妮吩咐女仆，声音里的某种东西促使她们拔腿就跑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6795');"><p>Ser Jorah took her arm. "My queen, Drogo will have no use for dragon’s eggs in the night lands. Better to sell them in Asshai. Sell one and we can buy a ship to take us back to the Free Cities. Sell all three and you will be a wealthy woman all your days."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6795" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士抓住她的臂膀。“女王陛下，卓戈在夜晚的国度是用不着龙蛋的，不如拿到亚夏去卖了，只需卖一颗，我们便足以买下一艘大船，返回自由贸易城邦。而卖掉三颗所换来的财富，够您一辈子享用不尽。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6796');"><p>"They were not given to me to sell," Dany told him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6796" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他送我这些蛋，不是要我拿去卖的。”丹妮告诉他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6797');"><p>She climbed the pyre herself to place the eggs around her sun-and-stars. The black beside his heart, under his arm. The green beside his head, his braid coiled around it. The cream-and-gold down between his legs. When she kissed him for the last time, Dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on his lips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6797" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她爬上火葬堆，亲自将龙蛋放置于她的曰和星身边。黑色的放在他心上，用手掌按住；绿色的放在他头旁，用发辪卷起；乳白和金黄相间的那颗则放在他双腿之间。随后，丹妮最后一次与他吻别，尝到他嘴唇上香精的甜蜜。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6798');"><p>As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. "You are mad," the godswife said hoarsely.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6798" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从火葬台上爬下来时，她注意到弥丽•马兹•笃尔注视着自己。“你疯了。”女祭司嘶声道。

Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped away, Dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi’s flat black eyes; in its place was something that might have been fear. Then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6804" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，我会的，”丹妮说，“但我要的不是你的哀嚎，而是你的生命。我记得你曾对我说：惟有死亡方能换取生命。”弥丽•马兹•笃尔张口欲言，但最后还是没有答话。 丹妮步下火葬台，发现巫魔女那双平板黑眼里的轻蔑已经不见，取而代之的是近似恐惧的神色。能做的都已经做了，接下来就是等待太阳落幕，群星现身。

The oil took the fire at once, the brush and dried grass a heartbeat later. Tiny flames went darting up the wood like swift red mice, skating over the oil and leaping from bark to branch to leaf. A rising heat puffed at her face, soft and sudden as a lover’s breath, but in seconds it had grown too hot to bear. Dany stepped backward. The wood crackled, louder and louder. Mirri Maz Duur began to sing in a shrill, ululating voice. The flames whirled and writhed, racing each other up the platform. The dusk shimmered as the air itself seemed to liquefy from the heat. Dany heard logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew louder, shriller?.?.?.?then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6808');"><p>And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. His clothing took fire, and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and greasy. Dany’s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, forever.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6809');"><p>She could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit. The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur’s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6809" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她闻到人肉烧熟的味道，这与营火上烤马肉的气息并无二致。在渐渐深沉的暮色里，火葬台宛如一只咆哮的巨兽，盖过了弥丽•马兹•笃尔微弱的惨叫，吐出长长的火舌，舔噬夜空的肚腹。烟雾愈加浓密，多斯拉克人一边咳嗽，一边纷纷后退。橙色的巨焰鼓起炼狱的强风，将附近的旗臶吹得啪哒作响，木柴嘶声爆裂，发光的余烬自烟幕中升起，朝无边的黑夜飘去，仿若干百只新生的萤火虫。烈焰高升，挥动着巨大而火红的翅膀，逼得多斯拉克人节节退后，连莫尔蒙也走避开来，只有丹妮纹丝不动。她是真龙传人，体内有熊熊烈焰。

The flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, alive with heat. Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing. This is a wedding, too, she thought. Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent. The godswife thought her a child, but children grow, and children learn.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6810" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>早在很久以前，她便已察觉了真相，只是当时的火盆不够热，丹妮一边想，一边朝大火走近一步。焰火在她面前蠕动，活如婚礼当天的女舞者，旋转着，高歌着，舞动着她们红橙黄三色的头纱。它们模样虽然骇人，形体却随着高热展现生机，显得异常美丽。丹妮张开双臂，迎向它们，她的皮肤泛红发光。这也像一场婚礼啊，她心想。弥丽•马兹•笃尔已经安静下来。女祭司当她是小孩子，但孩子是会成长，会学习的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6811');"><p>Another step, and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, even through her sandals. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had once run. Ser Jorah was shouting behind her, but he did not matter anymore, only the fire mattered. The flames were so beautiful, the loveliest things she had ever seen, each one a sorcerer robed in yellow and orange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame; she saw fish and foxes and monsters, wolves and bright birds and flowering trees, each more beautiful than the last. She saw a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, its flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame. Yes, my love, my sun-and-stars, yes, mount now, ride now.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6812');"><p>Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing.

Bits of burning wood slid down at her, and Dany was showered with ash and cinders. And something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk of curved rock, pale and veined with gold, broken and smoking. The roaring filled the world, yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder.

No, she wanted to shout to him, no, my good knight, do not fear for me. The fire is mine. I am Daenerys Stormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don’t you see? Don’t you SEE? With a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky, the pyre collapsed and came down around her.
