</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2187');"><p>One Sunday the race for the Grand Prix de Paris was being run in the Bois de Boulogne beneath skies rendered sultry by the first heats of June. The sun that morning had risen amid a mist of dun-colored dust, but toward eleven o'clock, just when the carriages were reaching the Longchamps course, a southerly wind had swept away the clouds; long streamers of gray vapor were disappearing across the sky, and gaps showing an intense blue beyond were spreading from one end of the horizon to the other. In the bright bursts of sunlight which alternated with the clouds the whole scene shone again, from the field which was gradually filling with a crowd of carriages, horsemen and pedestrians, to the still-vacant course, where the judge's box stood, together with the posts and the masts for signaling numbers, and thence on to the five symmetrical stands of brickwork and timber, rising gallery upon gallery in the middle of the weighing enclosure opposite. Beyond these, bathed in the light of noon, lay the vast level plain, bordered with little trees and shut in to the westward by the wooded heights of Saint-Cloud and the Suresnes, which, in their turn, were dominated by the severe outlines of Mont-Valerien.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2187" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>六月份的一个星期日，天气刚开始炎热，天空昏昏暗暗，一场暴风雨就要来临，巴黎的跑马大奖赛正在布洛涅森林举行。清晨，太阳在橙黄色的尘雾中升起。但是，快到十一点钟，马车都到了隆尚赛马场时，骤然刮起一阵南风，把乌云驱散了；灰蒙蒙的雾霭散成长长的碎片，随风飘去，蓝莹莹的云隙不断伸扩开来，染蓝了整个天空。阳光从两片云彩之间照射下来，照在赛马场上，把一切照得金光灿烂。草地上渐渐挤满了马车、骑师和行人，但跑道上仍然阒无一人，只有裁判员的岗亭、终点标志杆和用于挂赛马成绩表的柱子。对面，在骑师体重测量处的围墙中央，有五座对称的观众看台，看台是用砖头和木架搭成的，其形状颇像长廊。赛马场外面，一片广阔的平地沐浴着中午阳光，周围长着小树，西边是长满树木的圣克鲁山丘和絮伦山丘，背后耸立着瓦莱莲峰。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2188');"><p>Nana, as excited as if the Grand Prix were going to make her fortune, wanted to take up a position by the railing next the winning post. She had arrived very early—she was, in fact, one of the first to come—in a landau adorned with silver and drawn, a la Daumont, by four splendid white horses. This landau was a present from Count Muffat. When she had made her appearance at the entrance to the field with two postilions jogging blithely on the near horses and two footmen perching motionless behind the carriage, the people had rushed to look as though a queen were passing. She sported the blue and white colors of the Vandeuvres stable, and her dress was remarkable. It consisted of a little blue silk bodice and tunic, which fitted closely to the body and bulged out enormously behind her waist, thereby bringing her lower limbs into bold relief in such a manner as to be extremely noticeable in that epoch of voluminous skirts. Then there was a white satin dress with white satin sleeves and a sash worn crosswise over the shoulders, the whole ornamented with silver guipure which shone in the sun. In addition to this, in order to be still more like a jockey, she had stuck a blue toque with a white feather jauntily upon her chignon, the fair tresses from which flowed down beyond her shoulders and resembled an enormous russet pigtail.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2188" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜兴致盎然，仿佛大奖赛要决定她的命运似的，她一心要坐在终点标志杆旁边紧靠栅栏的地方观看。她很早就来了，是到得最早的观众之一。她是乘坐一辆镶银的双篷四轮马车来的，由四匹雪白骏马拉着，这辆车是缪法伯爵作为礼物赠送给她的。当她到达草坪入口处时，骑在左边两匹马上的两名车夫驾车疾驶，两个跟班站在车子后部一动不动，这时人群中你推我搡，人人竞相观看，就像王后经过那里似的。她穿的服装是旺德夫尔赛马服的两种颜色，即蓝色和白色，显得非常别致，蓝绸短上衣和蓝绸紧身褡紧紧绷在身上，腰后高高凸起一个裙撑，这样，大腿的轮廓被明显衬托出来，当时流行穿宽大裙子，这样的穿戴打扮是不落俗套的；外面套一件白缎子长裙，袖子也是白缎子的，肩上披着一条白缎子三角围巾，全身穿戴都镶着银色镂空花边，被阳光照得闪闪烁烁。此外，为了使自己更像骑师的样子，她又大胆地在发髻上戴上一顶蓝色无边女帽，帽上插一根白翎毛，发髻上的一缕缕金发垂挂到背上，酷似红棕色马的长长尾巴。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2189');"><p>Twelve struck. The public would have to wait more than three hours for the Grand Prix to be run. When the landau had drawn up beside the barriers Nana settled herself comfortably down as though she were in her own house. A whim had prompted her to bring Bijou and Louiset with her, and the dog crouched among her skirts, shivering with cold despite the heat of the day, while amid a bedizenment of ribbons and laces the child's poor little face looked waxen and dumb and white in the open air. Meanwhile the young woman, without troubling about the people near her, talked at the top of her voice with Georges and Philippe Hugon, who were seated opposite on the front seat among such a mountain of bouquets of white roses and blue myosotis that they were buried up to their shoulders.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2189" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>十二点钟敲响了。还要等三个多小时，跑马大奖赛才能开始。娜娜的双篷四轮马车靠栅栏边停放后，她就像在家里一样自由自在。她一时心血来潮，竟把小狗珍宝和小路易也带来了。小狗躺在她的裙子里，虽然天气很热，还冷得哆哆嗦嗦；孩子身上披着彩带和花边，样子挺有趣，一声不吭，一张可怜的蜡黄小脸被风吹得变得苍白。而娜娜旁若无人，高声与乔治和菲利普谈话，兄弟两人坐在娜娜对面的一张长凳上，两旁是一束束白玫瑰和蓝色勿忘我，花堆放得与他们的肩膀一样高。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2190');"><p>"Well then," she was saying, "as he bored me to death, I showed him the door. And now it's two days that he's been sulking."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2190" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“唉！”她说道，“他把我烦死了，我就把他赶出去了……已经两天了，他还在生我的气呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2191');"><p>She was talking of Muffat, but she took care not to confess to the young men the real reason for this first quarrel, which was that one evening he had found a man's hat in her bedroom. She had indeed brought home a passer-by out of sheer ennui—a silly infatuation.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2191" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她说的是缪法，不过她没有对于贡兄弟说出他们第一次口角的原因。一天晚上，缪法在她的卧室里发现一顶男人的帽子，那是她一时糊涂干的蠢事。为了消愁解闷，她把一个过路男人带回家了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2192');"><p>"You have no idea how funny he is," she continued, growing merry over the particulars she was giving. "He's a regular bigot at bottom, so he says his prayers every evening. Yes, he does. He's under the impression I notice nothing because I go to bed first so as not to be in his way, but I watch him out of the corner of my eye. Oh, he jaws away, and then he crosses himself when he turns round to step over me and get to the inside of the bed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2192" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们不知道他是多么滑稽可笑，”她继续说道，津津乐道地讲了一些细节，“实际上他是一个地道的伪君子……因为这样，他每天晚上都做祈祷。这可一点不假。他总以为我没有看见，因为我不想妨碍他，总是先上床睡觉，其实我在瞟着他，他口中念念有词……上床时还要画一个十字，从我身上跨过去，在床里边躺下……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2193');"><p>"Jove, it's sly," muttered Philippe. "That's what happens before, but afterward, what then?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2193" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！他真狡猾，”菲利普嘀咕道，“他上床前上床后都祈祷了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2194');"><p>She laughed merrily.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2194" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她莞尔一笑，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2195');"><p>"Yes, just so, before and after! When I'm going to sleep I hear him jawing away again. But the biggest bore of all is that we can't argue about anything now without his growing 'pi.' I've always been religious. Yes, chaff as much as you like; that won't prevent me believing what I do believe! Only he's too much of a nuisance: he blubbers; he talks about remorse. The day before yesterday, for instance, he had a regular fit of it after our usual row, and I wasn't the least bit reassured when all was over."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2195" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是这样，上床前和上床后都祈祷。当我模模糊糊要睡着时，又听见他嘴里念念有词……不过，最令人讨厌的是，我们每次争吵，他还装成一副教士的样子。我嘛，我一向是信仰宗教的，你们怎么笑我都可以，反正不影响我信仰我该信仰的宗教……他太讨厌了，他抽抽噎噎，还说他心里很内疚。前天就是这样，我们争吵后，他歇斯底里大发作，搞得我一点不得安宁……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2196');"><p>But she broke off, crying out:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2196" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说到这里，她突然中断了这个话题，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2197');"><p>"Just look at the Mignons arriving. Dear me, they've brought the children! Oh, how those little chaps are dressed up!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2197" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“瞧，米尼翁夫妇来了。瞧！他们把孩子也带来了！…… 小家伙们穿得怪模怪样！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2198');"><p>The Mignons were in a landau of severe hue; there was something substantially luxurious about their turnout, suggesting rich retired tradespeople. Rose was in a gray silk gown trimmed with red knots and with puffs; she was smiling happily at the joyous behavior of Henri and Charles, who sat on the front seat, looking awkward in their ill-fitting collegians' tunics. But when the landau had drawn up by the rails and she perceived Nana sitting in triumph among her bouquets, with her four horses and her liveries, she pursed up her lips, sat bolt upright and turned her head away. Mignon, on the other hand, looking the picture of freshness and gaiety, waved her a salutation. He made it a matter of principle to keep out of feminine disagreements.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2198" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>米尼翁夫妇乘坐一辆颜色素净的双篷四轮马车，那是发了横财的市民的豪华奢侈品。罗丝穿一条灰色绸裙子，裙子镶着红色绉泡饰带和花结，满面笑容，她看见亨利和夏尔挺快乐，心里很高兴。两个孩子坐在前面凳子上，穿着过分肥大的中学生制服，看上去有点耸肩缩颈。双篷四轮马车停放在栅栏边时，罗丝瞥见娜娜喜气洋洋地坐在鲜花中间，她的车子由四匹马拉着，还有穿号衣的跟班和车夫，她抿起嘴唇，板起面孔，扭过头去。米尼翁的态度恰恰相反，他容光焕发，目光炯炯，挥挥手，打了一个招呼。女人之间发生口角，他一般是不介入的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2199');"><p>"By the by," Nana resumed, "d'you know a little old man who's very clean and neat and has bad teeth—a Monsieur Venot? He came to see me this morning."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2199" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对啦，”娜娜又说道，“你们认识一个矮个子老头吗？就是那个穿得干干净净、满嘴坏牙齿的韦诺先生……他今天早上来看过我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2200');"><p>"Monsieur Venot?" said Georges in great astonishment. "It's impossible! Why, the man's a Jesuit!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2200" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“韦诺先生吗？”乔治惊愕地说道，“这不可能，他是耶稣会的会士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2201');"><p>"Precisely; I spotted that. Oh, you have no idea what our conversation was like! It was just funny! He spoke to me about the count, about his divided house, and begged me to restore a family its happiness. He was very polite and very smiling for the matter of that. Then I answered to the effect that I wanted nothing better, and I undertook to reconcile the count and his wife. You know it's not humbug. I should be delighted to see them all happy again, the poor things! Besides, it would be a relief to me for there are days—yes, there are days—when he bores me to death."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2201" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说得很对，我也感觉出来了。啊！你们真想象不到我们谈了些什么！真有趣！……他向我谈到伯爵，说他们夫妻关系不和睦，恳求我把幸福还给他们家庭……不过，他很懂礼貌，说话时笑吟吟的……于是，我回答说，这是我求之不得的事，我保证叫伯爵同他的妻子言归于好……你们知道，我这样说不是开玩笑，看到他们幸福，我感到由衷高兴！另外，我也可以轻松一下，因为前些日子，说真的，他把我缠得够呛！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2202');"><p>The weariness of the last months escaped her in this heartfelt outburst. Moreover, the count appeared to be in big money difficulties; he was anxious and it seemed likely that the bill which Labordette had put his name to would not be met.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2202" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这出自内心的呼声道出了她最近几个月来的厌倦情绪。此外，伯爵似乎手头极其拮据；他心事重重，他签给拉博德特的本票很可能兑现不了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2203');"><p>"Dear me, the countess is down yonder," said Georges, letting his gaze wander over the stands.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2203" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“恰巧伯爵夫人在那儿。”乔治说道，他的目光扫视一下看台。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2204');"><p>"Where, where?" cried Nana. "What eyes that baby's got! Hold my sunshade, Philippe."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2204" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她在哪儿？”娜娜大声问道，“这孩子眼睛真好！……菲利普，替我打一下阳伞。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2205');"><p>But with a quick forward dart Georges had outstripped his brother. It enchanted him to be holding the blue silk sunshade with its silver fringe. Nana was scanning the scene through a huge pair of field glasses.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2205" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔治的动作快，抢在他哥哥的前头把伞接过来，他能替娜娜拿着那把带着银色流苏的阳伞，心里非常高兴。娜娜眼睛对着一只很大的望远镜，向看台上到处观望。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2206');"><p>"Ah yes! I see her," she said at length. "In the right-hand stand, near a pillar, eh? She's in mauve, and her daughter in white by her side. Dear me, there's Daguenet going to bow to them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2206" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！对了，我看见她了，”她终于说道，她在看台右边，在一根柱子旁边，对吗？她穿着淡紫色衣服，她女儿穿着白色衣服，坐在她身旁……瞧！达盖内走过去跟她们打招呼了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2207');"><p>Thereupon Philippe talked of Daguenet's approaching marriage with that lath of an Estelle. It was a settled matter—the banns were being published. At first the countess had opposed it, but the count, they said, had insisted. Nana smiled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2207" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，菲利普便谈起达盖内不久要同瘦高个子爱丝泰勒结婚的事。这桩婚事已经定下来了，教堂的结婚预告已经登出来了。伯爵夫人起初反对女儿的婚事，但是据说伯爵硬要她同意。娜娜听后笑了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2208');"><p>"I know, I know," she murmured. "So much the better for Paul. He's a nice boy—he deserves it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2208" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道，我知道，”她低声说道，“对保尔来说，这太好了。 他是个好小伙子，他配得上这门亲事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2209');"><p>And leaning toward Louiset:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2209" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她弯下腰，对小路易说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2210');"><p>"You're enjoying yourself, eh? What a grave face!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2210" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你觉得好玩吗？……看你那一本正经的样子！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2211');"><p>The child never smiled. With a very old expression he was gazing at all those crowds, as though the sight of them filled him with melancholy reflections. Bijou, chased from the skirts of the young woman who was moving about a great deal, had come to nestle, shivering, against the little fellow.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2211" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>孩子脸上没有一丝笑容，他看着周围的人，神态像个大人。他心情沮丧，思考着他所看到的一切。娜娜动个不停，小狗从她的裙子里跑出来，跑到孩子身边，浑身哆嗦着。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2212');"><p>Meanwhile the field was filling up. Carriages, a compact, interminable file of them, were continually arriving through the Porte de la Cascade. There were big omnibuses such as the Pauline, which had started from the Boulevard des Italiens, freighted with its fifty passengers, and was now going to draw up to the right of the stands. Then there were dogcarts, victorias, landaus, all superbly well turned out, mingled with lamentable cabs which jolted along behind sorry old hacks, and four-in-hands, sending along their four horses, and mail coaches, where the masters sat on the seats above and left the servants to take care of the hampers of champagne inside, and "spiders," the immense wheels of which were a flash of glittering steel, and light tandems, which looked as delicately formed as the works of a clock and slipped along amid a peal of little bells. Every few seconds an equestrian rode by, and a swarm of people on foot rushed in a scared way among the carriages. On the green the far-off rolling sound which issued from the avenues in the Bois died out suddenly in dull rustlings, and now nothing was audible save the hubbub of the ever-increasing crowds and cries and calls and the crackings of whips in the open. When the sun, amid bursts of wind, reappeared at the edge of a cloud, a long ray of golden light ran across the field, lit up the harness and the varnished coach panels and touched the ladies' dresses with fire, while amid the dusty radiance the coachmen, high up on their boxes, flamed beside their great whips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2212" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>草坪上的车马和人越来越多。马车继续不断从瀑布门那边驶来，一辆挨着一辆，排成一条长龙。其中有从意大利人大街开来的波利娜式公共马车，里面坐了五十名乘客，驶到看台右边停下来；还有运送猎犬的马车、四轮敞篷马车、豪华双篷四轮马车，它们同由劣马拉着的摇摇晃晃的破旧出租马车混在一起；有一人驾驶的四马马车，有邮车，车主人高高坐在座位上，仆人们则在车里看管香槟酒篮子，还有两轮轻便马车，巨大的钢轮闪烁着耀眼的光芒，有双套的轻便二轮马车，其部件精巧得像钟表的零件，行驶起来时，车上的铃铛叮叮作响。不时有一个骑马人，还有一群行人行色匆匆地从马车中走过。车子从遥远的布洛涅森林那边驶来，一路上发出隆隆的声音，一到草坪上，隆隆声便戛然变成低沉摩擦声；现在草坪上的人越来越多，耳畔只响着嘈杂声、叫喊声、呼唤声、鞭子在空中飞舞的劈啪声。疾风吹散乌云，太阳从一片云边上又露了出来，一道金光照射下来，把马具和上了油漆的车身照得通亮，女人们的服装被照得红艳艳的；在耀眼的光雾中，车夫们高高地坐在驾驶座上，他们的身子和长长的鞭子像着了火似的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2213');"><p>Labordette was getting out of an open carriage where Gaga, Clarisse and Blanche de Sivry had kept a place for him. As he was hurrying to cross the course and enter the weighing enclosure Nana got Georges to call him. Then when he came up:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2213" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>拉博德特从一辆敞篷四轮马车上走下来，车上还坐着加加、克莱利瑟和布朗瑟德西弗里，拉博德特的座位是他们留给他的。他行色匆匆，要穿越跑道，进入测量体重处时，娜娜让乔治把他叫过来。当他走过来时，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2214');"><p>"What's the betting on me?" she asked laughingly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2214" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜笑着问道： “我的牌价是多少？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2215');"><p>She referred to the filly Nana, the Nana who had let herself be shamefully beaten in the race for the Prix de Diane and had not even been placed in April and May last when she ran for the Prix des Cars and the Grande Poule des Produits, both of which had been gained by Lusignan, the other horse in the Vandeuvres stable. Lusignan had all at once become prime favorite, and since yesterday he had been currently taken at two to one.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2215" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她指的是那匹取名为娜娜的小母马，这匹马在狄安娜奖比赛中遭到惨败，甚至在今年四月份和五月份举行的飞车杯奖和良种幼马大赛奖中，也未获得名次，获胜的是旺德夫尔的一匹名叫吕西尼昂的马。于是，吕西尼昂顿时成了人们的热门话题；从前一天起，人们普遍以二比一为它下赌注。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2216');"><p>"Always fifty to one against," replied Labordette.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2216" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你的比数总是一比五十。”拉博德特回答道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2217');"><p>"The deuce! I'm not worth much," rejoined Nana, amused by the jest. "I don't back myself then; no, by jingo! I don't put a single louis on myself."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2217" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真见鬼，我真不值钱，”娜娜又说道，她觉得这种玩笑很逗趣，“那么，我不拿自己来赌了……绝不赌自己！我连一个金路易也不押在我自己身上。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2218');"><p>Labordette went off again in a great hurry, but she recalled him. She wanted some advice. Since he kept in touch with the world of trainers and jockeys he had special information about various stables. His prognostications had come true a score of times already, and people called him the "King of Tipsters."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2218" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>拉博德特忙得不亦乐乎，说完转身就走，娜娜连忙把他叫回来，她想问问他的看法。他与赛马训练师和骑师们一直有联系，对于参赛的马匹的情况特别熟悉，他的预言已经多次准确无误，人家都叫他赛马消息大王。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2219');"><p>"Let's see, what horses ought I to choose?" said the young woman. "What's the betting on the Englishman?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2219" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说，我该押哪匹马？”娜娜再三问道，“那匹英国马的牌价是多少？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2220');"><p>"Spirit? Three to one against. Valerio II, the same. As to the others, they're laying twenty-five to one against Cosinus, forty to one against Hazard, thirty to one against Bourn, thirty-five to one against Pichenette, ten to one against Frangipane."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2220" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说的是那匹精灵马吗？是一比三……瓦勒里奥二世，也是一比三，其余的马，如科西尼是一比二十五，幸运是一比四十，布姆是一比三十，皮什内特是一比三十五，杏仁奶油是一比十……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2221');"><p>"No, I don't bet on the Englishman, I don't. I'm a patriot. Perhaps Valerio II would do, eh? The Duc de Corbreuse was beaming a little while ago. Well, no, after all! Fifty louis on Lusignan; what do you say to that?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2221" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，我不赌那匹英国马了，我是一个爱国的人……嗯？我可能押瓦勒里奥二世，德科布勒兹公爵刚才喜形于色……哎！不！还是不行。五十个金路易押在吕西尼昂上，你说行吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2222');"><p>Labordette looked at her with a singular expression. She leaned forward and asked him questions in a low voice, for she was aware that Vandeuvres commissioned him to arrange matters with the bookmakers so as to be able to bet the more easily. Supposing him to have got to know something, he might quite well tell it her. But without entering into explanations Labordette persuaded her to trust to his sagacity. He would put on her fifty louis for her as he might think best, and she would not repent of his arrangement.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2222" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>拉博德特用异乎寻常的表情看了她一眼。娜娜俯着身子，低声询问他，因为她知道旺德夫尔委托拉博德特到赛马赌注登记人那里为他下赌注的，以便赌得更方便些。他若得到什么消息，就会说出来。可是拉博德特什么也未透露，叫她相信他嗅觉是敏感的，他将根据自己的判断，把她的五十个金路易押上去，她对此是不会后悔的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2223');"><p>"All the horses you like!" she cried gaily, letting him take his departure, "but no Nana; she's a jade!"

The young men thought her sally very amusing, while Louiset in his ignorance lifted his pale eyes to his mother's face, for her loud exclamations surprised him. However, there was no escape for Labordette as yet. Rose Mignon had made a sign to him and was now giving him her commands while he wrote figures in a notebook. Then Clarisse and Gaga called him back in order to change their bets, for they had heard things said in the crowd, and now they didn't want to have anything more to do with Valerio II and were choosing Lusignan. He wrote down their wishes with an impassible expression and at length managed to escape. He could be seen disappearing between two of the stands on the other side of the course.

They were by this time drawn up five rows deep, and a dense mass of them spread along the barriers, checkered by the light coats of white horses. Beyond them other carriages stood about in comparative isolation, looking as though they had stuck fast in the grass. Wheels and harness were here, there and everywhere, according as the conveyances to which they belonged were side by side, at an angle, across and across or head to head. Over such spaces of turf as still remained unoccupied cavaliers kept trotting, and black groups of pedestrians moved continually. The scene resembled the field where a fair is being held, and above it all, amid the confused motley of the crowd, the drinking booths raised their gray canvas roofs which gleamed white in the sunshine. But a veritable tumult, a mob, an eddy of hats, surged round the several bookmakers, who stood in open carriages gesticulating like itinerant dentists while their odds were pasted up on tall boards beside them.

Besides the Mignons, besides Gaga, Clarisse and Blanche, there were present, to the right and left, behind and in the middle of the mass of carriages now hemming in her landau, the following ladies: Tatan Nene and Maria Blond in a victoria, Caroline Hequet with her mother and two gentlemen in an open carriage, Louise Violaine quite alone, driving a little basket chaise decked with orange and green ribbons, the colors of the Mechain stables, and finally, Lea de Horn on the lofty seat of a mail coach, where a band of young men were making a great din. Farther off, in a HUIT RESSORTS of aristocratic appearance, Lucy Stewart, in a very simple black silk dress, sat, looking distinguished beside a tall young man in the uniform of a naval cadet. But what most astounded Nana was the arrival of Simonne in a tandem which Steiner was driving, while a footman sat motionless, with folded arms, behind them. She looked dazzling in white satin striped with yellow and was covered with diamonds from waist to hat. The banker, on his part, was handling a tremendous whip and sending along his two horses, which were harnessed tandemwise, the leader being a little warm-colored chestnut with a mouselike trot, the shaft horse a big brown bay, a stepper, with a fine action.

Having arrived in a cab, whence she could not see anything, the Tricon had quietly mounted the coach box.

All the latter smiled discreetly at her while she, in her superiority, pretended not to know them.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2241');"><p>Nana was scandalized. Presently the merits of the several horses began to be discussed, and La Faloise, wishing to be thought very much in the swim, spoke of them all as sorry jades. Frangipane, Baron Verdier's horse, was by The Truth out of Lenore. A big bay horse he was, who would certainly have stood a chance if they hadn't let him get foundered during training. As to Valerio II from the Corbreuse stable, he wasn't ready yet; he'd had the colic in April. Oh yes, they were keeping that dark, but he was sure of it, on his honor! In the end he advised Nana to choose Hazard, the most defective of the lot, a horse nobody would have anything to do with. Hazard, by jingo—such superb lines and such an action! That horse was going to astonish the people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2241" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜听了非常气愤。于是，大家便议论起每匹马的优点。拉法卢瓦兹装得很内行，他把所有的马都说成劣马。他接着评论起来：“韦尔迪埃男爵的那匹杏红奶油，说实话，倒是一匹高大的枣红马，如果不是训练时弄得筋疲力尽，倒是有希望获胜的。至于科布勒兹的那匹瓦勒里奥二世，在四月份患了绞痛病，不能参加比赛；噢，这些情况人家都不说出来，不过，他用荣誉担保，他说的情况是确实无疑的！他最后劝娜娜押幸运，它是梅尚家的，大家认为那是最差的一匹马，谁也不肯押它。真了不起！幸运体形漂亮，行动敏捷！这匹马肯定会让大家吃惊！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2242');"><p>"No," said Nana, "I'm going to put ten louis on Lusignan and five on Boum."

Gresham had bad luck; he would never get to the post.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2245" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他急得透不过气来。菲利普指出，吕西尼昂获得过飞车杯奖和良种幼马大赛奖。拉法卢瓦兹立即驳斥说，这又能证明什么呢？什么也不能证明。恰恰相反，应该对这一点产生怀疑。何况骑吕西尼昂的骑师是格雷沙姆；你们竟然给它打包票！格雷沙姆是个倒霉鬼，它绝对赢不了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2246');"><p>And from one end of the field to the other the discussion raging in Nana's landau seemed to spread and increase. Voices were raised in a scream; the passion for gambling filled the air, set faces glowing and arms waving excitedly, while the bookmakers, perched on their conveyances, shouted odds and jotted down amounts right furiously. Yet these were only the small fry of the betting world; the big bets were made in the weighing enclosure. Here, then, raged the keen contest of people with light purses who risked their five-franc pieces and displayed infinite covetousness for the sake of a possible gain of a few louis. In a word, the battle would be between Spirit and Lusignan. Englishmen, plainly recognizable as such, were strolling about among the various groups. They were quite at home; their faces were fiery with excitement; they were afready triumphant. Bramah, a horse belonging to Lord Reading, had gained the Grand Prix the previous year, and this had been a defeat over which hearts were still bleeding. This year it would be terrible if France were beaten anew. Accordingly all the ladies were wild with national pride. The Vandeuvres stable became the rampart of their honor, and Lusignan was pushed and defended and applauded exceedingly. Gaga, Blanche, Caroline and the rest betted on Lusignan. Lucy Stewart abstained from this on account of her son, but it was bruited abroad that Rose Mignon had commissioned Labordette to risk two hundred louis for her. The Tricon, as she sat alone next her driver, waited till the last moment. Very cool, indeed, amid all these disputes, very far above the ever-increasing uproar in which horses' names kept recurring and lively Parisian phrases mingled with guttural English exclamations, she sat listening and taking notes majestically.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2246" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在娜娜的马车上掀起的这场争论，现在似乎扩大到整个草坪上。一些人发出尖叫声，赌博的热情高涨了，每人的脸上火辣辣的，大家挥舞着拳头。赌注登记人高高地站在他们的马车上，声嘶力竭地喊着中彩牌价，记录着数字。呆在这里的都是一些下小赌注的赌客，押大赌注的都在体重测量处的围墙内进行；在这里进行激烈较量的，只是一些囊中没有几个钱的人，拿一百个苏来冒冒险，觊觎的也不过是几个金路易。总而言之，一场大战将在精灵和吕西尼昂之间展开。一些英国人一看就认得出来，他们在人群中来回走动，像在自己家里一样，个个满脸通红，露出胜利者的神态。里丁勋爵的那匹名叫布拉玛的马，在去年的大奖赛中赢得了胜利，法国人还在为法国马的惨败而心痛不已，今年如果法国再次败北，将是法国人的一次灾难。所以，出于民族自豪感，太太们都兴奋万分。旺德夫尔的马变成她们的荣誉的堡垒，大家都推吕西尼昂，为它辩护，为它欢呼。加加、布朗瑟、卡罗利娜和其他人都押吕西尼昂。吕西斯图华因为儿子在场，没有下赌注；有消息传说罗丝米尼翁委托拉博德特为她押了两百金路易。只有拉特里贡一人坐在车夫旁边，要等到最后再押赌注；她不管别人的争论，保持着冷静，越来越响的嘈杂声对她的情绪毫无影响。嘈杂声中有人叫马的名字，在巴黎人的轻快的谈话声中，夹杂着英国人的带喉音的叫嚷声，她神色庄重，一边听着，一边把数字记下来。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2248');"><p>Indeed, nobody was asking for the filly; she was not even being mentioned. The outsider of the Vandeuvres's stud was swamped by Lusignan's popularity. But La Faloise flung his arms up, crying:

But as the three young men were darting off to propagandize, Nana shouted after them:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2253');"><p>"You know I don't want to have anything to do with her; I don't for the world! Georges, ten louis on Lusignan and five on Valerio II."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2254');"><p>Meanwhile they had started fairly off, and she watched them gaily as they slipped between wheels, ducked under horses' heads and scoured the whole field. The moment they recognized anyone in a carriage they rushed up and urged Nana's claims. And there were great bursts of laughter among the crowd when sometimes they turned back, triumphantly signaling amounts with their fingers, while the young woman stood and waved her sunshade. Nevertheless, they made poor enough work of it. Some men let themselves be persuaded; Steiner, for instance, ventured three louis, for the sight of Nana stirred him. But the women refused point-blank. "Thanks," they said; "to lose for a certainty!" Besides, they were in no hurry to work for the benefit of a dirty wench who was overwhelming them all with her four white horses, her postilions and her outrageous assumption of side. Gaga and Clarisse looked exceedingly prim and asked La Faloise whether he was jolly well making fun of them. When Georges boldly presented himself before the Mignons' carriage Rose turned her head away in the most marked manner and did not answer him. One must be a pretty foul sort to let one's name be given to a horse! Mignon, on the contrary, followed the young man's movements with a look of amusement and declared that the women always brought luck.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2254" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可是，他们飞快地走了。娜娜高兴极了，她望着他们在马车中间穿行，弯着腰从马头下面走来走去，跑遍了整个草坪。他们一看见哪辆马车里有熟人，便赶紧跑过去，竭力推荐娜娜。当他们推荐成功了，就转过头来，笑容满面，伸出手指，表示数字多少，娜娜站在车上，摇动着阳伞，人群中发出一阵哄堂大笑。不过，他们的成绩相当可怜。只有几个男人被他们说服了，例如斯泰内，只要他一看见娜娜，心里就发痒，他押了三个金路易冒冒险。但是女人们都干脆拒绝下赌注。谢谢吧，下了肯定要输掉！干吗急于去为一个娼妇扬名而卖力呢？这个婊子以她的四匹白马，她的跟班和她那副趾高气扬的神态，把她们都压垮了。加加和克拉利瑟很不高兴，责问拉法卢瓦兹是不是根本不把她们放在眼里。乔治鼓着勇气走到米尼翁夫妇的马车前面，罗丝怒不可遏，转过头去，不理睬他。把自己的名字给了一匹马，真是一个十足的下流货！米尼翁则不然，他兴致勃勃地听乔治的宣传，说女人总是会给人带来好运的。 几个年轻人跑了很长时间，去找赌注登记人了解情况，当他们回来时，娜娜问道：

Amid the expectant murmur of the bystanders she questioned him about this sudden rise in her value. But he replied evasively; doubtless a demand for her had arisen. She had to content herself with this explanation. Moreover, Labordette announced with a preoccupied expression that Vandeuvres was coming if he could get away.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2259');"><p>The race was ending unnoticed; people were all waiting for the Grand Prix to be run—when a storm burst over the Hippodrome. For some minutes past the sun had disappeared, and a wan twilight had darkened over the multitude. Then the wind rose, and there ensued a sudden deluge. Huge drops, perfect sheets of water, fell. There was a momentary confusion, and people shouted and joked and swore, while those on foot scampered madly off to find refuge under the canvas of the drinking booths. In the carriages the women did their best to shelter themselves, grasping their sunshades with both hands, while the bewildered footmen ran to the hoods. But the shower was already nearly over, and the sun began shining brilliantly through escaping clouds of fine rain. A blue cleft opened in the stormy mass, which was blown off over the Bois, and the skies seemed to smile again and to set the women laughing in a reassured manner, while amid the snorting of horses and the disarray and agitation of the drenched multitude that was shaking itself dry a broad flush of golden light lit up the field, still dripping and glittering with crystal drops.

Then she dabbed it over Bijou, who was trembling more violently than ever. It would not matter in the least; there were a few drops on the white satin of her dress, but she didn't care a pin for them. The bouquets, refreshed by the rain, glowed like snow, and she smelled one ecstatically, drenching her lips in it as though it were wet with dew.

At that distance you could only distinguish a compact, confused mass of people, heaped up, as it were, on the ascending ranges of steps, a dark background relieved by light dots which were human faces. The sunlight filtered in through openings near the roof at each end of the stand and detached and illumined portions of the seated multitude, where the ladies' dresses seemed to lose their distinguishing colors. But Nana was especially amused by the ladies whom the shower had driven from the rows of chairs ranged on the sand at the base of the stands. As courtesans were absolutely forbidden to enter the enclosure, she began making exceedingly bitter remarks about all the fashionable women therein assembled. She thought them fearfully dressed up, and such guys!

Her money was well placed; she would see that all in good time.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2275');"><p>Just then the field grew more animated than before. Open-air lunches were arranged in the interval before the Grand Prix. There was much eating and more drinking in all directions, on the grass, on the high seats of the four-in-hands and mail coaches, in the victorias, the broughams, the landaus. There was a universal spread of cold viands and a fine disorderly display of champagne baskets which footmen kept handing down out of the coach boots. Corks came out with feeble pops, which the wind drowned. There was an interchange of jests, and the sound of breaking glasses imparted a note of discord to the high-strung gaiety of the scene. Gaga and Clarisse, together with Blanche, were making a serious repast, for they were eating sandwiches on the carriage rug with which they had been covering their knees. Louise Violaine had got down from her basket carriage and had joined Caroline Hequet. On the turf at their feet some gentlemen had instituted a drinking bar, whither Tatan, Maria, Simonne and the rest came to refresh themselves, while high in air and close at hand bottles were being emptied on Lea de Horn's mail coach, and, with infinite bravado and gesticulation, a whole band were making themselves tipsy in the sunshine, above the heads of the crowd. Soon, however, there was an especially large crowd by Nana's landau. She had risen to her feet and had set herself to pour out glasses of champagne for the men who came to pay her their respects. Francois, one of the footmen, was passing up the bottles while La Faloise, trying hard to imitate a coster's accents, kept pattering away:

At one moment she conceived the idea of sending Georges with a glass of champagne to Rose Mignon, who was affecting temperance.

Then Nana remembered Louiset, who was sitting forgotten behind her. Maybe he was thirsty, and she forced him to take a drop or two of wine, which made him cough dreadfully.

A stealthy impulse was gradually bringing in the whole field. Nana would fling everyone a laughing smile or an amusing phrase.

Soon there was only one noisy crowd, and that was round her landau, where she queened it among outstretched glasses, her yellow hair floating on the breeze and her snowy face bathed in the sunshine. Then by way of a finishing touch and to make the other women, who were mad at her triumph, simply perish of envy, she lifted a brimming glass on high and assumed her old pose as Venus Victrix.

The prize given by the city of Paris had just been run for, and Cornemuse had gained it. Now the Grand Prix was about to be run, and the fever of the crowd increased, and they were tortured by anxiety and stamped and swayed as though they wanted to make the minutes fly faster. At this ultimate moment the betting world was surprised and startled by the continued shortening of the odds against Nana, the outsider of the Vandeuvres stables. Gentlemen kept returning every few moments with a new quotation: the betting was thirty to one against Nana; it was twenty-five to one against Nana, then twenty to one, then fifteen to one. No one could understand it. A filly beaten on all the racecourses! A filly which that same morning no single sportsman would take at fifty to one against! What did this sudden madness betoken? Some laughed at it and spoke of the pretty doing awaiting the duffers who were being taken in by the joke. Others looked serious and uneasy and sniffed out something ugly under it all. Perhaps there was a "deal" in the offing. Allusion was made to well-known stories about the robberies which are winked at on racecourses, but on this occasion the great name of Vandeuvres put a stop to all such accusations, and the skeptics in the end prevailed when they prophesied that Nana would come in last of all.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2303');"><p>And with that the discussion began again. Price was an English celebrity. Why had Vandeuvres got this jockey to come over, seeing that Gresham ordinarily rode Nana? Besides, they were astonished to see him confiding Lusignan to this man Gresham, who, according to La Faloise, never got a place. But all these remarks were swallowed up in jokes, contradictions and an extraordinarily noisy confusion of opinions. In order to kill time the company once more set themselves to drain bottles of champagne. Presently a whisper ran round, and the different groups opened outward. It was Vandeuvres. Nana affected vexation.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2303" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是大家又议论纷纷。普里斯在英国颇有名气，在法国却鲜为人知。平时总是格雷沙姆骑娜娜，为什么旺德夫尔这次请来这位骑师呢？另外，人们惊讶的是他把吕西尼昂也交给格雷沙姆，据拉法卢瓦兹说，格雷沙姆从来没有跑赢过。不过，所有这些意见，都被开玩笑的话、反对的意见和各种不寻常的意见的嘈杂声淹没了。人们为了消磨时间，又喝起香槟酒。接着，听见一阵窃窃私语声，人群中让出一条路来。旺德夫尔来了。 娜娜佯作生气。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2319');"><p>Such a tone was not germane either to his temperament or his habits, and Nana was rather surprised than wounded. Besides, he was ashamed of himself directly afterward, and when she begged him in a dry voice to behave politely he apologized. For some time past he had suffered from such sudden changes of temper. No one in the Paris of pleasure or of society was ignorant of the fact that he was playing his last trump card today. If his horses did not win, if, moreover, they lost him the considerable sums wagered upon them, it would mean utter disaster and collapse for him, and the bulwark of his credit and the lofty appearance which, though undermined, he still kept up, would come ruining noisily down. Moreover, no one was ignorant of the fact that Nana was the devouring siren who had finished him off, who had been the last to attack his crumbling fortunes and to sweep up what remained of them. Stories were told of wild whims and fancies, of gold scattered to the four winds, of a visit to Baden-Baden, where she had not left him enough to pay the hotel bill, of a handful of diamonds cast on the fire during an evening of drunkenness in order to see whether they would burn like coal. Little by little her great limbs and her coarse, plebeian way of laughing had gained complete mastery over this elegant, degenerate son of an ancient race. At that time he was risking his all, for he had been so utterly overpowered by his taste for ordure and stupidity as to have even lost the vigor of his skepticism. A week before Nana had made him promise her a chateau on the Norman coast between Havre and Trouville, and now he was staking the very foundations of his honor on the fulfillment of his word. Only she was getting on his nerves, and he could have beaten her, so stupid did he feel her to be.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2319" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这样说话的口气不像他的性格，也不像他的习惯，与其说她感到不快，还不如说她感到惊讶。而旺德夫尔呢，他觉得有些羞愧，当她态度冷漠地要求他说话礼貌一些时，他便向她道歉。一段时间以来，他经常这样突然发脾气。在巴黎的风流男女中和上流社会中，没有人不知道他是在孤注一掷。如果他的赛马都跑不赢，把押在它们身上的巨款全部输光，对他来说，将是一场大灾难，他就彻底完蛋；他那长年累月建立起来的信誉，他那已受损坏、被债务和放荡掏空了的生命所维持的华丽外表，就要在毁灭性的巨响中崩溃。没有一个人不知道，娜娜是吞噬男人的娼妇，是她葬送了他；她是在他濒于破产时，最后来到他生活中的女人，她把他的财产洗劫一空。据说他们疯狂地挥霍钱财，一次去巴黎旅游，她把他的钱花得精光，最后连付旅馆的钱也不剩；一天晚上，他们醉酒后，居然抓起一把钻石扔进炭火里，想观察一下钻石是否也像煤炭一样燃烧。娜娜以她粗壮的四肢、巴黎郊区妇女的下流笑声征服了这个精明、没落的古老家族的子弟。现在，他已好色成性，连戒心也丧失殆尽，只好铤而走险了。一个星期以前，她还要他答应她在勒阿弗尔和特鲁维尔之间的诺曼底海滨买一座别墅，他只能用他的最后荣誉来保证他信守自己的诺言。不过，这一次她惹怒了他，他觉得她很愚蠢，真想揍她一顿。

Nana, greatly puffed up at the thought that at last she was setting foot on the forbidden ground, put on her best behavior and walked slowly by the ladies seated at the foot of the stands. On ten rows of chairs the toilets were densely massed, and in the blithe open air their bright colors mingled harmoniously. Chairs were scattered about, and as people met one another friendly circles were formed, just as though the company had been sitting under the trees in a public garden. Children had been allowed to go free and were running from group to group, while over head the stands rose tier above crowded tier and the light-colored dresses therein faded into the delicate shadows of the timberwork. Nana stared at all these ladies. She stared steadily and markedly at the Countess Sabine. After which, as she was passing in front of the imperial stand, the sight of Muffat, looming in all his official stiffness by the side of the empress, made her very merry.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2321');"><p>"Oh, how silly he looks!" she said at the top of her voice to Vandeuvres. She was anxious to pay everything a visit. This small parklike region, with its green lawns and groups of trees, rather charmed her than otherwise. A vendor of ices had set up a large buffet near the entrance gates, and beneath a rustic thatched roof a dense throng of people were shouting and gesticulating. This was the ring. Close by were some empty stalls, and Nana was disappointed at discovering only a gendarme's horse there. Then there was the paddock, a small course some hundred meters in circumference, where a stable help was walking about Valerio II in his horsecloths. And, oh, what a lot of men on the graveled sidewalks, all of them with their tickets forming an orange-colored patch in their bottonholes! And what a continual parade of people in the open galleries of the grandstands! The scene interested her for a moment or two, but truly, it was not worth while getting the spleen because they didn't admit you inside here.

In order to overtop and command the surrounding crowd they had taken up positions on wooden benches, and they were advertising their prices on the trees beside them. They had an ever-vigilant glance, and they booked wagers in answer to a single sign, a mere wink, so rapidly that certain curious onlookers watched them openmouthed, without being able to understand it all. Confusion reigned; prices were shouted, and any unexpected change in a quotation was received with something like tumult. Occasionally scouts entered the place at a run and redoubled the uproar as they stopped at the entrance to the rotunda and, at the tops of their voices, announced departures and arrivals. In this place, where the gambling fever was pulsing in the sunshine, such announcements were sure to raise a prolonged muttering sound.

It was one of his former coachmen, an enormous fellow with the shoulders of an ox and a high color. Now that he was trying his fortunes at race meetings on the strength of some mysteriously obtained capital, the count was doing his utmost to push him, confiding to him his secret bets and treating him on all occasions as a servant to whom one shows one's true character. Yet despite this protection, the man had in rapid succession lost very heavy sums, and today he, too, was playing his last card. There was blood in his eyes; he looked fit to drop with apoplexy.

But as he was going off Marechal remembered something and was sorry he had not questioned him about the shortening of the odds on the filly.

It was like a waiting room in a suburban station, and Nana was again hugely disillusioned, for she had been picturing to herself something on a very vast scale, a monumental machine, in fact, for weighing horses. Dear me, they only weighed the jockeys! Then it wasn't worth while making such a fuss with their weighing! In the scale a jockey with an idiotic expression was waiting, harness on knee, till a stout man in a frock coat should have done verifying his weight. At the door a stable help was holding a horse, Cosinus, round which a silent and deeply interested throng was clustering.

At this Nana got up and stood on one of the seats of her carriage so as to obtain a better view, and in so doing she trampled the bouquets of roses and myosotis underfoot. With a sweeping glance she took in the wide, vast horizon. At this last feverish moment the course was empty and closed by gray barriers, between the posts of which stood a line of policemen. The strip of grass which lay muddy in front of her grew brighter as it stretched away and turned into a tender green carpet in the distance. In the middle landscape, as she lowered her eyes, she saw the field swarming with vast numbers of people, some on tiptoe, others perched on carriages, and all heaving and jostling in sudden passionate excitement.

When Nana turned in the direction of the stands on the other side the faces seemed diminished, and the dense masses of heads were only a confused and motley array, filling gangways, steps and terraces and looming in deep, dark, serried lines against the sky. And beyond these again she over looked the plain surrounding the course. Behind the ivy-clad mill to the right, meadows, dotted over with great patches of umbrageous wood, stretched away into the distance, while opposite to her, as far as the Seine flowing at the foot of a hill, the avenues of the park intersected one another, filled at that moment with long, motionless files of waiting carriages; and in the direction of Boulogne, on the left, the landscape widened anew and opened out toward the blue distances of Meudon through an avenue of paulownias, whose rosy, leafless tops were one stain of brilliant lake color. People were still arriving, and a long procession of human ants kept coming along the narrow ribbon of road which crossed the distance, while very far away, on the Paris side, the nonpaying public, herding like sheep among the wood, loomed in a moving line of little dark spots under the trees on the skirts of the Bois.

Valerio II scored a success as he came in; he was small and very lively, and his colors were soft green bordered with pink. The two Vandeuvres horses were slow to make their appearance, but at last, in Frangipane's rear, the blue and white showed themselves. But Lusignan, a very dark bay of irreproachable shape, was almost forgotten amid the astonishment caused by Nana. People had not seen her looking like this before, for now the sudden sunlight was dyeing the chestnut filly the brilliant color of a girl's red-gold hair.

And with that a strange ardent prayer, which was almost religious, went up for Lusignan, while people heaped abuse on Spirit and his dismal mute of a jockey. Among the crowd scattered over the grass the wind of excitement put up whole groups of people and set their boot soles flashing in air as they ran. Horsemen crossed the green at a furious gallop. And Nana, who was slowly revolving on her own axis, saw beneath her a surging waste of beasts and men, a sea of heads swayed and stirred all round the course by the whirlwind of the race, which clove the horizon with the bright lightning flash of the jockeys. She had been following their movement from behind while the cruppers sped away and the legs seemed to grow longer as they raced and then diminished till they looked slender as strands of hair. Now the horses were running at the end of the course, and she caught a side view of them looking minute and delicate of outline against the green distances of the Bois. Then suddenly they vanished behind a great clump of trees growing in the middle of the Hippodrome.

They were pointed out; people estimated what ground they had gained or lost in disconnected, gasping phrases. And Nana, who had mounted up on the coach box, as though some power had lifted her thither, stood white and trembling and so deeply moved as not to be able to speak.

It was the last fierce outburst of colossal partisanship; a hundred thousand spectators were possessed by a single passion, burning with the same gambler's lust, as they gazed after the beasts, whose galloping feet were sweeping millions with them. The crowd pushed and crushed—fists were clenched; people gaped, openmouthed; every man was fighting for himself; every man with voice and gesture was madly speeding the horse of his choice.

And in a fit of furious audacity and triumphant will he put his heart into the filly, held her up, lifted her forward, drenched in foam, with eyes of blood. The whole rush of horses passed with a roar of thunder: it took away people's breaths; it swept the air with it while the judge sat frigidly waiting, his eye adjusted to its task. Then there was an immense re-echoing burst of acclamation. With a supreme effort Price had just flung Nana past the post, thus beating Spirit by a head.

The cry rolled up and swelled with the violence of a tempest, till little by little it filled the distance, the depths of the Bois as far as Mont Valerien, the meadows of Longchamps and the Plaine de Boulogne. In all parts of the field the wildest enthusiasm declared itself. "Vive Nana! Vive la France! Down with England!" The women waved their sunshades; men leaped and spun round, vociferating as they did so, while others with shouts of nervous laughter threw their hats in the air. And from the other side of the course the enclosure made answer; the people on the stands were stirred, though nothing was distinctly visible save a tremulous motion of the air, as though an invisible flame were burning in a brazier above the living mass of gesticulating arms and little wildly moving faces, where the eyes and gaping mouths looked like black dots. The noise did not cease but swelled up and recommenced in the recesses of faraway avenues and among the people encamped under the trees, till it spread on and on and attained its climax in the imperial stand, where the empress herself had applauded. "Nana! Nana! Nana!" The cry rose heavenward in the glorious sunlight, whose golden rain beat fiercely on the dizzy heads of the multitude.

By and by, when this crowd had become somewhat less disorderly and a lane had been formed as far as the exit and Nana was again applauded as she went off with Price hanging lifelessly and vacantly over her neck, she smacked her thigh energetically, lost all self-possession, triumphed in crude phrases:

Labordette, as he made off, had just announced to her a gain of two thousand louis, for he had put her fifty on Nana at forty to one. But the money stirred her less than this unforeseen victory, the fame of which made her queen of Paris. All the other ladies were losers. With a raging movement Rose Mignon had snapped her sunshade, and Caroline Hequet and Clarisse and Simonne—nay, Lucy Stewart herself, despite the presence of her son—were swearing low in their exasperation at that great wench's luck, while the Tricon, who had made the sign of the cross at both start and finish, straightened up her tall form above them, went into an ecstasy over her intuition and damned Nana admiringly as became an experienced matron.

The band of Nana's immediate followers had made a fierce uproar, and now Georges, choking with emotion, continued shouting all by himself in breaking tones.

Indeed, that movement which had made her carriage a center of attraction to the whole field was now ending in an apotheosis, and Queen Venus was enthroned amid suddenly maddened subjects. Bordenave, behind her, was muttering oaths, for he yearned to her as a father. Steiner himself had been reconquered—he had deserted Simonne and had hoisted himself upon one of Nana's carriage steps. When the champagne had arrived, when she lifted her brimming glass, such applause burst forth, and "Nana! Nana! Nana!" was so loudly repeated that the crowd looked round in astonishment for the filly, nor could any tell whether it was the horse or the woman that filled all hearts.

Meanwhile, amid much disputing, the name of Vandeuvres was again mentioned. It was quite evident now: for two years past Vandeuvres had been preparing his final stroke and had accordingly told Gresham to hold Nana in, while he had only brought Lusignan forward in order to make play for the filly. The losers were vexed; the winners shrugged their shoulders. After all, wasn't the thing permissible? An owner was free to run his stud in his own way. Many others had done as he had! In fact, the majority thought Vandeuvres had displayed great skill in raking in all he could get about Nana through the agency of friends, a course of action which explained the sudden shortening of the odds. People spoke of his having laid two thousand louis on the horse, which, supposing the odds to be thirty to one against, gave him twelve hundred thousand francs, an amount so vast as to inspire respect and to excuse everything.

Voices were raised; an atrocious scandal began to be openly canvassed. That poor fellow Vandeuvres was done for; he had spoiled his splendid hit with a piece of flat stupidity, an idiotic robbery, for he had commissioned Marechal, a shady bookmaker, to lay two thousand louis on his account against Lusignan, in order thereby to get back his thousand and odd openly wagered louis. It was a miserable business, and it proved to be the last rift necessary to the utter breakup of his fortune. The bookmaker being thus warned that the favorite would not win, had realized some sixty thousand francs over the horse. Only Labordette, for lack of exact and detailed instructions, had just then gone to him to put two hundred louis on Nana, which the bookmaker, in his ignorance of the stroke actually intended, was still quoting at fifty to one against. Cleared of one hundred thousand francs over the filly and a loser to the tune of forty thousand, Marechal, who felt the world crumbling under his feet, had suddenly divined the situation when he saw the count and Labordette talking together in front of the enclosure just after the race was over. Furious, as became an ex-coachman of the count's, and brutally frank as only a cheated man can be, he had just made a frightful scene in public, had told the whole story in atrocious terms and had thrown everyone into angry excitement. It was further stated that the stewards were about to meet.

After all, it was quite likely; she remembered such things, and then that Marechal had a dirty, hangdog look. Nevertheless, she was still rather doubtful when Labordette appeared. He was very white.

When toward ten o'clock she made her appearance, the uproar was afready formidable. That classic night of madness had brought together all that was young and pleasure loving, and now this smart world was wallowing in the coarseness and imbecility of the servants' hall. There was a fierce crush under the festoons of gas lamps, and men in evening coats and women in outrageous low-necked old toilets, which they did not mind soiling, were howling and surging to and fro under the maddening influence of a vast drunken fit. At a distance of thirty paces the brass instruments of the orchestra were inaudible. Nobody was dancing. Stupid witticisms, repeated no one knew why, were going the round of the various groups. People were straining after wit without succeeding in being funny. Seven women, imprisoned in the cloakroom, were crying to be set free. A shallot had been found, put up to auction and knocked down at two louis. Just then Nana arrived, still wearing her blue-and-white racecourse costume, and amid a thunder of applause the shallot was presented to her. People caught hold of her in her own despite, and three gentlemen bore her triumphantly into the garden, across ruined grassplots and ravaged masses of greenery. As the bandstand presented an obstacle to her advance, it was taken by storm, and chairs and music stands were smashed. A paternal police organized the disorder.

That morning she was chatting with Mme Lerat, the old lady having come in to bring her news of Louiset, whom the open air had upset. A long story, which was occupying the attention of all Paris, interested her beyond measure. Vandeuvres, after being warned off all racecourses and posted at the Cercle Imperial on the very evening after the disaster, had set fire to his stable on the morrow and had burned himself and his horses to death.

Oh, how they did frighten me when they told me about it yesterday evening! You see, he might easily have murdered me some fine night. And besides, oughtn't he to have given me a hint about his horse? I should at any rate have made my fortune! He said to Labordette that if I knew about the matter I would immediately inform my hairdresser and a whole lot of other men. How polite, eh? Oh dear, no, I certainly can't grieve much for him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2426" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他早就对我说过，他要这样死。”娜娜说道，“这个人真正是个疯子！……昨天晚上我知道这个消息时，我被吓坏了。你知道，他简直能杀死我，一天夜里……另外，他哪一匹马能跑赢也不告诉我一声，这样做对吗？如果告诉我，我至少能发一笔财！……他对拉博德特说过，如果让我知道了，我就会立即告诉我的理发师和许多男人。这话说得多么不礼貌！……啊！ 不，说实话，对他的死我也不怎么惋惜。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2427');"><p>After some reflection she had grown very angry. Just then Labordette came in; he had seen about her bets and was now the bearer of some forty thousand francs. This only added to her bad temper, for she ought to have gained a million. Labordette, who during the whole of this episode had been pretending entire innocence, abandoned Vandeuvres in decisive terms. Those old families, he opined, were worn out and apt to make a stupid ending.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2427" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她越想越生气。恰巧这时候，拉博德特走进来；他已算好了帐，给娜娜送来四万法郎。她见了这笔钱，更是火上加油，因为她本来可以赢一百万法郎，对于这次投机勾当，拉博德特装得一身清白，干脆抛弃了旺德夫尔。这些古老家族早就徒有其名了，最后都落得这样愚蠢的结局。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2428');"><p>"Oh dear no!" said Nana. "It isn't stupid to burn oneself in one's stable as he did. For my part, I think he made a dashing finish; but, oh, you know, I'm not defending that story about him and Marechal. It's too silly. Just to think that Blanche has had the cheek to want to lay the blame of it on me! I said to her: 'Did I tell him to steal?' Don't you think one can ask a man for money without urging him to commit crime? If he had said to me, 'I've got nothing left,' I should have said to him, 'All right, let's part.' And the matter wouldn't have gone further."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2428" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！不对，”娜娜说道，“把自己关在马厩里自焚，这种做法并不算愚蠢，我倒觉得这样是挺有勇气的……啊！你知道，他与马雷夏尔的那件纠葛，我并不为他辩护。我一想到布朗瑟想把这件事的责任推给我，我就回答说：‘难道我叫他去舞弊的吗？’一个女人向一个男人讨钱，并不是叫他去犯罪，你说是吗？如果他对我说：‘我一个子儿也没有了’，我就会对他说，‘行了，我们分手吧。’这样事情就不会糟到这个地步。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2430');"><p>"But as to the merry little finish up, oh, that was awfully smart!" continued Nana. "It appears to have been terrible enough to give you the shudders! He sent everybody away and boxed himself up in the place with a lot of petroleum. And it blazed! You should have seen it! Just think, a great big affair, almost all made of wood and stuffed with hay and straw! The flames simply towered up, and the finest part of the business was that the horses didn't want to be roasted. They could be heard plunging, throwing themselves against the doors, crying aloud just like human beings. Yes, people haven't got rid of the horror of it yet."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2430" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不过他那略具喜庆色彩的结局倒是很精彩的！”娜娜又说，“看上去很可怕，令人毛骨悚然。他把所有人都打发走，把自己关在马厩里，浇上汽油……接着烧起来，此景值得一看！可以想象，一个几乎完全是木质结构的庞然大物，里面又堆满麦秸和干草！……火焰蹿得有宝塔一般高……最壮观的，是那些不愿被活活烧死的马。只听见它们尥着蹶子，拼命撞门，像人一样喊叫……是的，人们对这幕可怖情景还心有余悸呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2431');"><p>Labordette let a low, incredulous whistle escape him. For his part, he did not believe in the death of Vandeuvres. Somebody had sworn he had seen him escaping through a window. He had set fire to his stable in a fit of aberration, but when it had begun to grow too warm it must have sobered him. A man so besotted about the women and so utterly worn out could not possibly die so pluckily.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2431" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>拉博德特轻轻舒了口气，样子像将信将疑。他不相信旺德夫尔已经死了。有人发誓说，亲眼看见他从一扇窗户逃了出去。他是一时神经错乱才点火烧马厩的。不过，到被烧到不能忍受时，他神智清醒了。一个在女人圈子里鬼混、落到囊空如洗境地的蠢男人是不会这样勇敢自杀的。
