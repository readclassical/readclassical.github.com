</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"><p>"We should start back," Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them. "The wildlings are dead."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“既然野人（注解１）已经死了，”眼看周围的树林逐渐阴暗，盖瑞不禁催促道，“咱们回头吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"><p>"Do the dead frighten you?" Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“死人吓着你了么？”威玛•罗伊斯爵士带着轻浅的笑意问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"><p>Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. "Dead is dead," he said. "We have no business with the dead."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>盖瑞并未中激将之计，年过五十的他算得上是个老人，这辈子看过太多的贵族子弟来来去去。“死了就是死了，”他说，“咱们没必要和死人打交道。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"><p>"Are they dead?" Royce asked softly. "What proof have we?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你确定他们真的死了么？”罗伊斯轻声问，“证据何在？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"><p>"Will saw them," Gared said. "If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough for me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“威尔看到了，”盖瑞说，“我相信他说的话。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"><p>Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner. "My mother told me that dead men sing no songs," he put in.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威尔早料到他们早晚会把自己卷入这场争执，只是没想到这么快。“我妈说过，死人不会唱歌。”他插嘴。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"><p>"My wet nurse said the same thing, Will," Royce replied. "Never believe anything you hear at a woman’s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead." His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“威尔，我奶妈也说过这话，”罗伊斯回答，“千万别相信你在女人怀里听到的话。 人就算是死了，也能让我们学到很多东西。”他的余音在暮色昏暝的森林里回荡，似乎大声了点。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"><p>"We have a long ride before us," Gared pointed out. "Eight days, maybe nine. And night is falling."
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“眼前路还长得很，”盖瑞指出，“少不了要走个八九天，况且现在天色渐渐暗了下来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"><p>Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. "It does that every day about this time. Are you unmanned by the dark, Gared?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威长罗伊斯爵士意兴阑珊地扫视天际。“每天这时候不都这样？盖瑞，你该不会伯黑吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"><p>Will could see the tightness around Gared’s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night’s Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威尔可以看见盖瑞紧抿的嘴唇，以及他厚重黑斗篷下强自遏抑的怒火。盖瑞当了四十年的守夜人（注解２），这种资历可不是随便给人寻开心的。但是盖瑞不只是愤怒，在他受伤的自尊底下，威尔隐约可以察觉到某种潜藏的不安，一种近似于畏惧的紧张情绪。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"><p>Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now, and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威尔深有同感。他戍守绝境长城不过四年，当初首次越墙北进，所有的传说故事突然都涌上心头，把他吓得四肢发软，事后回想起难免觉得好笑。如今他是拥有百余次巡逻经验的老手，眼前这片南方人称作鬼影森林的无垠荒野，他早已无所畏惧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"><p>Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而今晚却是个例外。此夜回异于往昔，四面环暗中有种莫可名状，让他汗毛竖立的惊悚。他们轻骑北出长城，九天来昼夜不断推进，紧咬野人土匪的足迹。情况日益恶化，而今天已然降到谷底。阴森北风吹得树影幢幢，宛如狰狞活物，威尔整天都觉得自己受到一种冰冷且对他毫无好感的不知名东西监视，盖瑞也感觉到了，此刻威尔心中只想掉转马头，没命似地逃回长城。但这却是万万不能在长官面前说起的念头。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"><p>Especially not a commander like this one.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>尤其是这样的长官。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"><p>Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch for less than half a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe was concerned.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威玛•罗伊斯爵士出身贵族世家，在儿孙满堂的家里排行老么。他是个俊美的十八岁青年，有双灰色眸子，举止优雅，瘦得像把尖刀。骑在他那匹健壮的黑色战马上，比骑着体型较小的犁马的威尔和盖瑞高出许多。他穿着黑色皮靴，黑色羊毛裤，黑色鼹鼠皮手套，黑色羊毛衫外头是硬皮甲，又罩了一件闪闪发光的黑色环甲。威玛爵士宣誓成为守夜人还不满半年，但他绝非毫无准备空手而来，最起码他的行头一件不少。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"><p>His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. "Bet he killed them all himself, he did," Gared told the barracks over wine, "twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior." They had all shared the laugh.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他身上最耀眼的行头，自然便是那件既厚实，又软得吓人的黑色貂皮斗篷。“我敢打赌，那一堆黑貂一定是他亲手杀的，”盖瑞在军营里喝酒时对战友说，“我们伟大的战士哦，把它们的小头一颗颗扭断啦。”当时可引得众人哄笑成一团。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"><p>It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron. Gared must have felt the same.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>假如你的长官是个大伙儿饮酒作乐时嘲笑的对象，你要怎么去尊敬他呢？威尔骑在马上，不禁如此想着。想必盖瑞也深有同感。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"><p>"Mormont said as we should track them, and we did," Gared said. "They’re dead. They shan’t trouble us no more. There’s hard riding before us. I don’t like this weather. If it snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow’s the best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice storm, my lord?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“莫尔蒙（注解３）叫我们追查野人行踪，我们也照办了，”盖瑞道，“现在他们死了，再也不会来骚扰我们。眼前还有好长一段路等着我们。我实在不喜欢这种天气，要是下起雪来，我们得花两个礼拜才能回去。下雪还算不上什么，大人，您可见过冰风暴肆虐的景象？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"><p>The lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that. "Tell me again what you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out."
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小少爷似乎没听见这番话。他用他特有的那种兴致缺缺、漫不经心的方式审视着渐暗的暮色。威尔跟在他身边已经有一段时间，知道这种时候最好不要打断他。“威尔，再跟我说一辫你看到了些什么。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"><p>Will had been a hunter before he joined the Night’s Watch. Well, a poacher in truth. Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters’ own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters’ own bucks, and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as silent as Will, and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在成为守夜人以前，威尔原本靠打猎维生。说得难听点，其实就是盗猎者。当年他在海利斯特家族的森林里偷猎公鹿，正忙着剥鹿皮，弄得一手血腥的时候，被受雇于梅利斯特家的流浪武士逮个正着。他若是不选择加入黑衫军，就只有双手被砍一途。威尔潜行的本事是一等一的，在森林里的无声潜行没人比得上，而黑衫军的弟兄们果然也很快就发现了他的长处。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"><p>"The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream," Will said. "I got close as I dared. There’s eight of them, men and women both. No children I could see. They put up a lean-to against the rock. The snow’s pretty well covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but the firepit was still plain as day. No one moving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so still."
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“营地在两哩外，翻过山脊，紧邻着一条溪。”威尔答道，“我已经靠得很近了。总共有八个人，男女都有，但没看见小孩。他们背靠着大石头，雪几乎要把营地整个盖住，不过我还是分辨得出来。没有营火，但火堆的余烬还很明显。他们动也没动，我仔细看了好一会儿，活人绝不会躺得这么安静。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"><p>"Did you see any blood?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你有发现血迹么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"><p>"Well, no," Will admitted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯，没有。”威尔坦承。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"><p>"Did you see any weapons?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你有看见任何武器么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"><p>"Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron. It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“几支剑、两三把弓，还有个家伙带了一柄斧头。铁打的双刃斧，看起来挺重的，就放在他右手边的地上。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"><p>"Did you make note of the position of the bodies?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你有记下他们躺着的相对位置么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"><p>Will shrugged. "A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on the ground. Fallen, like."
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威尔耸耸肩。“两三个靠在石头上，大部分都躺在地上，像是被打死的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"><p>"Or sleeping," Royce suggested.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“也有可能是在睡觉。”罗伊斯提议。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"><p>"Fallen," Will insisted. "There’s one woman up an ironwood, half-hid in the branches. A far-eyes." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“肯定是被打死的，”威尔坚持己见，“因为有个女的躲在铁树林里，应该是斥候。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"><p>He smiled thinly. "I took care she never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that she wasn’t moving neither." Despite himself, he shivered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他浅浅一笑。“我小心得很，没让她见着。但等到我靠近，却发现她也没反应。”说到这他不禁一阵颤抖。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"><p>"You have a chill?" Royce asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你受寒了？”罗伊斯问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"><p>"Some," Will muttered. "The wind, m’lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有点吧，”威尔喃喃道，“大人，是这风的关系。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"><p>The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves whispered past them, and Royce’s destrier moved restlessly. "What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?" Ser Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>年轻骑士转头面对灰发老兵。结霜的落叶在他们耳边低语飘过，罗伊斯的战马局促不安。“盖瑞，你觉得是谁杀了这些人？”威玛爵士随口问道，顺手整理他貂皮长袍的褶榈。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"><p>"It was the cold," Gared said with iron certainty. "I saw men freeze last winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up on you quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don’t have the strength to fight it. It’s easier just to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don’t feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and drowsy, and everything starts to fade, and then it’s like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, like."
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是这该死的天气，”盖瑞斩钉截铁地说，“上次冬天来的时候（注解４）我亲眼见过人活活冻死，再之前那次也看过，当时我还是个孩子。人人都说当时积雪深达四十尺，北风冷得跟冰一样，但更正要命的是低温。它会无声无息地逮住你，比威尔还安静，起先你会发抖、牙齿打颤，两腿一伸，梦见烫过的酒，温暖的营火。它可是很烫人的，再也没别的东西像寒冷一样烫人了。但只消过了一会儿，接着它会钻进你体内，开始填满你的身体，过不了多久你就没力气抵抗。你会觉得坐下或小睡片刻要容易得多，听说到了最后完全不会觉得痛苦。你会觉得先是浑身无力，昏昏欲睡，然后一切渐渐消逝，最后，就像是淹没在热牛奶里一样，安详得很。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"><p>"Such eloquence, Gared," Ser Waymar observed. "I never suspected you had it in you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我看你很有诗意嘛，”威玛爵士下了评论，“没想到你有这方面的天分。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"><p>"I’ve had the cold in me too, lordling." Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been. "Two ears, three toes, and the little finger off my left hand. I got off light. We found my brother frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face."
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，我亲身体验过严寒的威力，”盖瑞往后拉开他的挡风帽，好让威玛爵士清楚看见他耳朵冻掉之后剩下的肉团。“两只耳朵，三根脚趾，还有左手的小指，我这样算是轻伤了。我大哥当年就是在站岗的时候被活活冻死，等我们找到他，他脸上却还挂着笑意。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"><p>Ser Waymar shrugged. "You ought dress more warmly, Gared."
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威玛爵士耸肩道：“我说盖瑞，你该多穿两件衣服的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"><p>Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester Aemon had cut the ears away. "We’ll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes." He pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and sullen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>盖瑞怒视着他的年轻长官，气得耳根发红。当年伊蒙学士（注解５）把他坏死的耳朵割去之后，现在耳洞旁还留着伤疤。“等冬天真正来临的时候，再看看你能穿得多暖。” 他拉起当风帽，缩着身子骑在马上，阴沉地不再吭声。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"><p>"If Gared said it was the cold?.?.?.?" Will began.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“既然盖瑞都说是天气的关系了……”威尔正要开口。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"><p>"Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“威尔，上礼拜你有没有站卫兵？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"><p>"Yes, m’lord." There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches. What was the man driving at?
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有啊，大人。”他哪个礼拜没抽到站卫兵的签，这家伙究竟想说什么？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_41');"><p>"And how did you find the Wall?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_41" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“长城的情形如何？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_42');"><p>"Weeping," Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out. "They couldn’t have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn’t cold enough."
</p></origin><translate id="div_42" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在滴水啊，”威尔皱着眉头说。这下他听懂了。“所以说他们不是冻死的，假如城墙会滴水，表示天气还不够冷。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_43');"><p>Royce nodded. "Bright lad. We’ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire." The knight’s smile was cocksure. "Will, lead us there. I would see these dead men for myself."
</p></origin><translate id="div_43" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗伊斯点点头。“聪明。过去这礼拜结了点霜，偶尔还下点雪，但绝对没有冷到冻死八个人的地步。更何况他们穿着保暖的毛皮御寒衣物，所处的地形足以遮挡风雪，还有足够的生火材料。”骑士露出自信满满的笑容。“威尔，带路吧，我要亲眼看看这些死人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_44');"><p>And then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and honor bound them to obey.
</p></origin><translate id="div_44" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>事情演变至此，他们别无选择。既然命令都下了，也只有照办的份。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_45');"><p>Will went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light snow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its crust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier snorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. Gared brought up the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode.
</p></origin><translate id="div_45" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威尔打前锋，骑着他那头长毛的马，在矮树丛里小小心翼翼地探路。昨夜下了一场小雪，这会儿树丛底下有许多石块、树根和水洼，一不小心就会失足。威玛•罗伊斯爵士跟在后头，他那头高壮骏马不耐烦地吐着气。巡逻任务最不适合骑战马，但贵族子弟哪听得进去？老兵盖瑞殿后，一路低声喃喃自语。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_46');"><p>Twilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise, then faded to black. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will was grateful for the light.
</p></origin><translate id="div_46" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>暮色渐沉，无云的天空转为淤青般的深紫，然后没入黑幕。星星出来了，新月也升起。威尔暗自感谢星月的光亮。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_47');"><p>"We can make a better pace than this, surely," Royce said when the moon was full risen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_47" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们应该可以再走快点。”罗伊斯说。这时月亮已快升到天顶了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_48');"><p>"Not with this horse," Will said. Fear had made him insolent. "Perhaps my lord would care to take the lead?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_48" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你的马还没这份能耐，”威尔道，恐惧使得他无礼了起来。“还是少爷您要走前头试试？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_49');"><p>Ser Waymar Royce did not deign to reply.
</p></origin><translate id="div_49" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威玛•罗伊斯爵士显然不屑回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_50');"><p>Somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_50" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>---缺失---
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_51');"><p>Will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_51" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威尔在一棵长满树瘤的老铁树旁停住，然后下了马。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_52');"><p>"Why are you stopping?" Ser Waymar asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_52" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么停下来了？”威玛爵士问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_53');"><p>"Best go the rest of the way on foot, m’lord. It’s just over that ridge."
</p></origin><translate id="div_53" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，后面的路用走的比较好，翻过那座山脊就到了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_54');"><p>Royce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A cold wind whispered through the trees. His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-alive.
</p></origin><translate id="div_54" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗伊斯也停下来凝神远望，一脸思量的表情。一阵冷风飒飒响过林间，他的貂皮大衣在背后抖了一下，彷佛有了生命。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_55');"><p>"There’s something wrong here," Gared muttered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_55" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这儿不太对劲。”盖瑞喃喃地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_56');"><p>The young knight gave him a disdainful smile. "Is there?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_56" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>年轻骑士轻蔑地对他一笑。“有么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_57');"><p>"Can’t you feel it?" Gared asked. "Listen to the darkness."

He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well away from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the moonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the look of it. Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger.

He whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort.

Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the words seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a bird, a reflection on the snow, some trick of the moonlight. What had he seen, after all?

The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took.

No human metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the thing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor.
