</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4530');"><p>High," Syrio Forel called out, slashing at her head. The stick swords clacked as Arya parried.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4530" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“上。”西利欧•佛瑞尔叫喊着，朝她头部挥去。艾莉亚举剑挡格，木剑相交，喀的一声。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4531');"><p>"Left," he shouted, and his blade came whistling. Hers darted to meet it. The clack made him click his teeth together.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4531" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“左。”他又叫，木剑随即呼啸而出。她的剑也急速迎去。又是喀的一声，她咬紧牙关。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4532');"><p>"Right," he said, and "Low," and "Left," and "Left" again, faster and faster, moving forward. Arya retreated before him, checking each blow.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4532" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“右，”他说，之后是“下”、“左”、“左”，越来越快，向前步步进逼。艾莉亚则不断后退，挥开每一记攻势。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4533');"><p>"Lunge," he warned, and when he thrust she sidestepped, swept his blade away, and slashed at his shoulder. She almost touched him, almost, so close it made her grin. A strand of hair dangled in her eyes, limp with sweat. She pushed it away with the back of her hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4533" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“开始冲锋了。”他警告。于是当他向前猛攻，她往旁边一闪，扫开他的剑，朝他肩膀砍去。她差一点就碰到他了，就差那么一点点，她禁不住得意地笑起来。一撮淌着汗水的头发垂下，在她眼前晃来晃去，她用手背拨开。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4534');"><p>"Left," Syrio sang out. "Low." His sword was a blur, and the Small Hall echoed to the clack clack clack. "Left. Left. High. Left. Right. Left. Low. Left!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4534" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“左。”西利欧叫道。“下。”他的剑快得看不清，喀喀声响彻小厅。“左，左，上，左，右，左，下，左!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4535');"><p>The wooden blade caught her high in the breast, a sudden stinging blow that hurt all the more because it came from the wrong side. "Ow," she cried out. She would have a fresh bruise there by the time she went to sleep, somewhere out at sea. A bruise is a lesson, she told herself, and each lesson makes us better.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4535" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这一剑刺得很高，正中她的胸膛。她剧痛难忍，因为这次攻击方向全然不对，打了她一个措手不及。“哎哟!”她叫道。看来，等今晚在海上某个地方睡觉的时候，胸部大概已经淤青一片了。每次受伤都是一次教训，她告诉自己，而每次教训都让我们更强。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4536');"><p>Syrio stepped back. "You are dead now."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4536" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西利欧后退。“你已经死了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4537');"><p>Arya made a face. "You cheated," she said hotly. "You said left and you went right."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4537" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚扮起鬼脸。“你作弊啦，”她气冲冲地说，“你明明说左边结果却打右边。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4538');"><p>"Just so. And now you are a dead girl."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4538" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就是这样，你从此就是个死女孩了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4539');"><p>"But you lied!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4539" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可你‘骗人’啊!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4540');"><p>"My words lied. My eyes and my arm shouted out the truth, but you were not seeing."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4540" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的嘴巴骗人，我的眼睛和手说的可是真话，只是你视而不见。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4541');"><p>"I was so," Arya said. "I watched you every second!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4541" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我哪里看不见，”艾莉亚说，“我每秒钟都盯着你看!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4542');"><p>"Watching is not seeing, dead girl. The water dancer sees. Come, put down the sword, it is time for listening now."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4542" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“死掉的小妹妹，‘观看’不代表‘洞察’。水舞者一定要能洞察。来，把剑放下，听课的时候到了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4543');"><p>She followed him over to the wall, where he settled onto a bench. "Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, and are you knowing how that came to pass?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4543" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她跟着他走到墙边，他在板凳上坐下。“西利欧•佛瑞尔能当上布拉佛斯海王的首席剑士，你知道凭什么吗? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4544');"><p>"You were the finest swordsman in the city."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4544" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“因为你是全城最厉害的剑客。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4545');"><p>"Just so, but why? Other men were stronger, faster, younger, why was Syrio Forel the best? I will tell you now." He touched the tip of his little finger lightly to his eyelid. "The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4545" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就是这样，但为什么是我?有很多人比我强壮，比我敏捷，比我年轻，为什么是西利欧•佛瑞尔最厉害?现在让我来告诉你。”他用指尖轻轻碰了碰睫毛。“诀窍在于洞察，洞察事物的真相。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4546');"><p>"Hear me. The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow, to lands strange and wonderful, and when they return their captains fetch queer animals to the Sealord’s menagerie. Such animals as you have never seen, striped horses, great spotted things with necks as long as stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging manticores, tigers that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with scythes for claws. Syrio Forel has seen these things.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4546" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“听着。海风吹到何方，布拉佛斯的船就开往何地。他们去过很多稀奇古怪的地方，每次返航，船长都会为海王的百兽园献上远方的动物。那是你从未见过的各式珍禽异兽，比如有条纹的马，全身长满斑点、脖子像高跷一样长的东西，还有浑身是毛、长得跟母牛一样大的鼠猪，会螫人的狮身蝎尾兽，把幼兽装在袋子里的老虎，还有走来走去、有镰刀般的爪子的恐怖蜥蜴。这些东西西利欧•佛瑞尔通通都见过。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4547');"><p>"On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the Sealord sent for me. Many bravos had come to him, and as many had been sent away, none could say why. When I came into his presence, he was seated, and in his lap was a fat yellow cat. He told me that one of his captains had brought the beast to him, from an island beyond the sunrise. ‘Have you ever seen her like?’ he asked of me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4547" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我说的那天，前任首席剑土刚刚去世，海王便传我过去，只因按照布拉佛斯的传统必须立刻选择继承人。之前已有不少杀手去见过他，结果通通都被遣走，谁也说不出原因。我进去的时候，他安详地坐着，膝上躺了一只肥胖的黄猫，他告诉我：这是他手下某位船长从比日出之地更远的小岛上带回来给他的。‘你没见过像她这样的动物吧? ’他问我。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4548');"><p>"And to him I said, ‘Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like him,’ and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named the first sword."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4548" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“而我对他说：‘每晚我在布拉佛斯的小巷都见到几于只他这种动物。’海王听了抚掌大笑，当日就任命我为首席剑士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4549');"><p>Arya screwed up her face. "I don’t understand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4549" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚露出一张苦脸。“我不懂。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4550');"><p>Syrio clicked his teeth together. "The cat was an ordinary cat, no more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw. How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said ‘her,’ and that is what the others saw. Are you hearing?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4550" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西利欧把牙齿磨得咯咯作响。“那只是一只平凡无奇的猫。其他人以为会看到珍禽异兽，所以他们眼中就只看得到珍禽异兽。他们说这只猫很大，可那只猫并不特别大，只不过因为好吃懒做，海王又常拿自己餐桌上的东西喂它，所以才稍微发福。他们又说它耳朵小巧玲珑，其实只是因为和其他猫打架的时候被咬掉了一块。那明明就是只公猫，但海王开口说‘她’，他们也就信以为真。你听懂了吗?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4551');"><p>Arya thought about it. "You saw what was there."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4551" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚仔细想想。“你洞察了事情的真相。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4552');"><p>"Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4552" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就是这样。最重要的就是睁大眼睛。心会说谎，头脑会愚弄我们，只有眼睛雪亮。用你的眼睛看，用你的耳朵听，用你的嘴巴尝，用你的鼻子闻，用你的皮肤去感觉，最后才用脑袋去想，这样才会洞察真相。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4553');"><p>"Just so," said Arya, grinning.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4553" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就是这样。”艾莉亚嘻嘻笑道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4554');"><p>Syrio Forel allowed himself a smile. "I am thinking that when we are reaching this Winterfell of yours, it will be time to put this needle in your hand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4554" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西利欧•佛瑞尔难得地露出微笑。“我在想，等我们抵达你家那个临冬城，也差不多是该让你使用这把缝衣针的时候了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4555');"><p>"Yes!" Arya said eagerly. "Wait till I show Jon..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4555" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太棒了!”艾莉亚迫不及待地说，“到时候我让琼恩看——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4556');"><p>Behind her the great wooden doors of the Small Hall flew open with a resounding crash. Arya whirled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4556" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>轰的一声，身后的小厅大木门被人撞开，艾莉亚立刻旋身。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4557');"><p>A knight of the Kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five Lannister guardsmen arrayed behind him. He was in full armor, but his visor was up. Arya remembered his droopy eyes and rustcolored whiskers from when he had come to Winterfell with the king: Ser Meryn Trant. The red cloaks wore mail shirts over boiled leather and steel caps with lion crests. "Arya Stark," the knight said, "come with us, child."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4557" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一名御林铁卫站在门拱下，身后跟了五个兰尼斯特卫士。他全副武装，只把头盔的面罩打开。此人陪国王来临冬城作客时，艾莉亚见过他，记得他那低垂的眼睛和铁锈色的小胡子，这必是马林•特兰爵士无疑。红披风的侍卫穿着皮革背心和锁甲，头戴雄狮钢盔。“艾莉亚•史塔克，”骑士说，“孩子，跟我们走。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4558');"><p>Arya chewed her lip uncertainly. "What do you want?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4558" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚犹豫不决地噘起嘴。“你们找我做什么?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4559');"><p>"Your father wants to see you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4559" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你父亲要见你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4560');"><p>Arya took a step forward, but Syrio Forel held her by the arm. "And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in the place of his own? I am wondering."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4560" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚向前走了一步，但西利欧•佛利尔握住她的手。“艾德大人为何不派他的手下，反而派兰尼斯特家的人来呢? 我很好奇。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4561');"><p>"Mind your place, dancing master," Ser Meryn said. "This is no concern of yours."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4561" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“舞蹈老师，别不识好歹，”马林爵士说，“此事与你无关。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4562');"><p>"My father wouldn’t send you," Arya said. She snatched up her stick sword. The Lannisters laughed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4562" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我父亲才不会派你们来呢。”艾莉亚说着举起她的木剑。兰尼斯特侍卫见了哈哈大笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4563');"><p>"Put down the stick, girl," Ser Meryn told her. "I am a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, the White Swords."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4563" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小妹妹乖，把棍子放下，”马林爵士告诉她，“我乃御林铁卫众弟兄的一员，是宣誓效命的白骑士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4564');"><p>"So was the Kingslayer when he killed the old king," Arya said. "I don’t have to go with you if I don’t want."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4564" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“杀老国王的弑君者也是啊。”艾莉亚说，“我不想去，我不想跟你走。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4565');"><p>Ser Meryn Trant ran out of patience. "Take her," he said to his men. He lowered the visor of his helm.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4565" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>马林•特兰爵士没了耐性。“抓住她。”他对手下说，然后放下面罩。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4566');"><p>Three of them started forward, chainmail clinking softly with each step. Arya was suddenly afraid. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself, to slow the racing of her heart.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4566" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>三个卫士向前走来，锁子甲随着跨出的每一步发出清脆的碰撞。艾莉亚突然害怕起来。恐惧比利剑更伤人，她告诉自己，慢慢缓和狂乱的心跳。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4567');"><p>Syrio Forel stepped between them, tapping his wooden sword lightly against his boot. "You will be stopping there. Are you men or dogs that you would threaten a child?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4567" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西利欧•佛瑞尔走上前来，挡在中间，边拿木剑轻敲靴子。“到此为止。你们是人还是狗，居然有脸威胁小孩子?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4568');"><p>"Out of the way, old man," one of the red cloaks said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4568" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“滚开，老头子。”一名红袍侍卫叫道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4569');"><p>Syrio’s stick came whistling up and rang against his helm. "I am Syrio Forel, and you will now be speaking to me with more respect."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4569" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西利欧的木棍咻地一声上窜，敲了那人头盔一下。“我是西利欧•佛瑞尔，从现在开始，你跟我讲话要放尊重点。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4570');"><p>"Bald bastard." The man yanked free his longsword. The stick moved again, blindingly fast. Arya heard a loud crack as the sword went clattering to the stone floor. "My hand," the guardsman yelped, cradling his broken fingers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4570" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“秃头浑球。”来人拔出长剑。木棍再度窜动，快得刺眼。艾莉亚只听喀啦一声，钢剑已掉在石地板上。“我的子。”那名守卫惨叫着握住断掉的手指。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4571');"><p>"You are quick, for a dancing master," said Ser Meryn.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4571" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“以一个舞蹈老师来说，你挺快。”马林爵士评价。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4572');"><p>"You are slow, for a knight," Syrio replied.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4572" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“以一个骑士而言，你太慢。”西利欧回敬。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4573');"><p>"Kill the Braavosi and bring me the girl," the knight in the white armor commanded.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4573" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“宰了这布拉佛斯人，把那小女孩抓来。”白甲骑士命令。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4574');"><p>Four Lannister guardsmen unsheathed their swords. The fifth, with the broken fingers, spat and pulled free a dagger with his left hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4574" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>四个兰尼斯特士兵纷纷抽出佩剑，断指的那个啐了口唾沫，用左手拔出匕首。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4575');"><p>Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together, sliding into his water dancer’s stance, presenting only his side to the foe. "Arya child," he called out, never looking, never taking his eyes off the Lannisters, "we are done with dancing for the day. Best you are going now. Run to your father."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4575" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西利欧•佛瑞尔喀喀咬紧牙齿，滑出水舞者的姿势，侧面迎敌。“小艾莉亚，”他叫道，但他看都没看她一眼，自始至终没将视线自兰尼斯特卫兵身上移开。“今天的舞蹈课到此为止。你最好快走，跑步去找你父亲。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4576');"><p>Arya did not want to leave him, but he had taught her to do as he said. "Swift as a deer," she whispered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4576" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚不想抛下他，但他教导她要听话。“疾如鹿。”她小声说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4577');"><p>"Just so," said Syrio Forel as the Lannisters closed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4577" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就是这样。”西利欧•佛瑞尔说。兰尼斯特士兵向他围去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4578');"><p>Arya retreated, her own sword stick clutched tightly in her hand. Watching him now, she realized that Syrio had only been toying with her when they dueled. The red cloaks came at him from three sides with steel in their hands. They had chainmail over their chest and arms, and steel codpieces sewn into their pants, but only leather on their legs. Their hands were bare, and the caps they wore had noseguards, but no visor over the eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4578" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚缓缓后退，手里紧紧握着木剑。看着西利欧应战的架式，她才明白平日和她交手时，他不过随意玩玩罢了。红袍武土握着钢剑从三面向他进逼，他们的胸膛和手臂受锁甲保护，短裤缝了金属护膝，但脚上只有皮革绑腿，双手暴露在外。他们的头盔虽有护鼻，却没有面罩遮眼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4579');"><p>Syrio did not wait for them to reach him, but spun to his left. Arya had never seen a man move as fast. He checked one sword with his stick and whirled away from a second. Off balance, the second man lurched into the first. Syrio put a boot to his back and the red cloaks went down together. The third guard came leaping over them, slashing at the water dancer’s head. Syrio ducked under his blade and thrust upward. The guardsman fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole where his left eye had been.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4579" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西利欧不等他们靠近，便闪身向左。艾莉亚不敢想象人的动作竟能那么快。他用木棍挡住一把剑，旋身躲过第二把。第二个人失去重心，踉跄着朝先前那人跌去。西利欧朝他后背补上一脚，两个红袍武士摔成一团。第三个卫士跳过他们冲来，挥剑往水舞者的头砍去。西利欧身子一低，向上疾刺。那名守卫惨叫倒地，本来是左眼的地方，如今只剩一个血淋淋的窟窿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4580');"><p>The fallen men were getting up. Syrio kicked one in the face and snatched the steel cap off the other’s head. The dagger man stabbed at him. Syrio caught the thrust in the helmet and shattered the man’s kneecap with his stick. The last red cloak shouted a curse and charged, hacking down with both hands on his sword. Syrio rolled right, and the butcher’s cut caught the helmetless man between neck and shoulder as he struggled to his knees. The longsword crunched through mail and leather and flesh. The man on his knees shrieked. Before his killer could wrench free his blade, Syrio jabbed him in the apple of his throat. The guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back, clutching at his neck, his face blackening.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4580" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>摔倒的人准备爬起。西利欧踢中一人的面门，扯下另一人的头盔。拿匕首的人朝他猛刺，西利欧用头盔接住他的攻势，然后用木棍敲碎了来人的膝盖。最后一个红袍武士喝骂一声，双手持剑，猛力挥砍着朝他冲锋。西利欧疾闪向右，于是那个没了头盔，正挣扎着站起的人遭了殃，那记屠夫般的猛斩正中他肩脖交接处。利剑砍碎锁甲、皮革和血肉，此人跪倒在地，厉声惨叫。杀他的人还来不及抽出剑，西利欧已刺中他的喉头。卫土发出窒息般的叫声，蹒跚后退，双手掐着脖子，脸如死灰。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4581');"><p>Five men were down, dead, or dying by the time Arya reached the back door that opened on the kitchen. She heard Ser Meryn Trant curse. "Bloody oafs," he swore, drawing his longsword from its scabbard.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4581" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等艾莉亚走到通往厨房的后门时，五个人不是倒地丧命，就是奄奄一息。她听见马林•特兰爵士咒道：“一群废物，”然后拔出长剑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4582');"><p>Syrio Forel resumed his stance and clicked his teeth together. "Arya child," he called out, never looking at her, "be gone now."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4582" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西利欧•佛瑞尔恢复了战斗姿势，牙齿咯咯作响。“小艾莉亚，”他头也不回地叫道，“快走。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4583');"><p>Look with your eyes, he had said. She saw: the knight in his pale armor head to foot, legs, throat, and hands sheathed in metal, eyes hidden behind his high white helm, and in his hand cruel steel. Against that: Syrio, in a leather vest, with a wooden sword in his hand. "Syrio, run," she screamed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4583" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>用你的眼睛看，他刚才教导过。于是她看了：骑士穿着全身重铠，头、脚、乃至喉咙、手臂都由钢甲保护，双眼隐藏在纯白高盔后，手拿狰狞的精钢长剑。反观西利欧：皮革背心和手中的木剑。“西利欧，快跑!”她尖叫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4584');"><p>"The first sword of Braavos does not run," he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at him. Syrio danced away from his cut, his stick a blur.

Never do what they expect, Syrio once said. Arya went down, around and around, leaping over the narrow stone steps two and three at a time.

With each step she took, the shadows moved against the walls, as if they were turning to watch her pass. "Dragons," she whispered. She slid Needle out from under her cloak. The slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big, yet somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand.

She held Needle in her left hand, her sword hand, the candle in her right fist. Hot wax ran down across her knuckles. The entrance to the well had been to the left, so Arya went right. Part of her wanted to run, but she was afraid of snuffing out her candle. She heard the faint squeaking of rats and glimpsed a pair of tiny glowing eyes on the edge of the light, but rats did not scare her. Other things did. It would be so easy to hide here, as she had hidden from the wizard and the man with the forked beard. She could almost see the stableboy standing against the wall, his hands curled into claws with the blood still dripping from the deep gashes in his palms where Needle had cut him. He might be waiting to grab her as she passed. He would see her candle coming a long way off. Maybe she would be better off without the light?.?.?.?

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4628');"><p>Fear cuts deeper than swords, the quiet voice inside her whispered. Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She’d been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who’d been no bigger than Rickon was now. They’d only had one candle between them, and Bran’s eyes had gotten as big as saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter, with their wolves at their feet and their iron swords across their laps.

Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had told her there were spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. "There are worse things than spiders and rats," he whispered. "This is where the dead walk." That was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya’s hand.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4630');"><p>When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb’s leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. "You stupid," she told him, "you scared the baby," but Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4631');"><p>The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her. The stableboy was dead, she’d killed him, and if he jumped out at her she’d kill him again. She was going home. Everything would be better once she was home again, safe behind Winterfell’s grey granite walls.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4632');"><p>Her footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead of her as Arya plunged deeper into the darkness.
