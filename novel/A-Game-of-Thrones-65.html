</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5926');"><p>The flies circled Khal Drogo slowly, their wings buzzing, a low thrum at the edge of hearing that filled Dany with dread.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5926" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>成群苍蝇围绕着卓戈卡奥，缓缓打转，翅膀嗡嗡的声音在丹妮的听觉边际回环，令她满怀恐惧。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5927');"><p>The sun was high and pitiless. Heat shimmered in waves off the stony outcrops of low hills. A thin finger of sweat trickled slowly between Dany’s swollen breasts. The only sounds were the steady clop of their horses’ hooves, the rhythmic tingle of the bells in Drogo’s hair, and the distant voices behind them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5927" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>无情的骄阳高挂天空，热气从低矮丘陵裸露的岩层间蒸散而出。汗水如一根根纤细的手指，自丹妮肿胀的双乳缓缓流下。天地间，惟一的声音是马蹄坚定的哒哒声，丹妮发际铃铛有韵律的轻响，以及身后悄声的交谈。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5928');"><p>Dany watched the flies.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5928" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮盯着苍蝇。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5929');"><p>They were as large as bees, gross, purplish, glistening. The Dothraki called them bloodflies. They lived in marshes and stagnant pools, sucked blood from man and horse alike, and laid their eggs in the dead and dying. Drogo hated them. Whenever one came near him, his hand would shoot out quick as a striking snake to close around it. She had never seen him miss. He would hold the fly inside his huge fist long enough to hear its frantic buzzing. Then his fingers would tighten, and when he opened his hand again, the fly would be only a red smear on his palm.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5929" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>它们大如蜜蜂，体形沉重，略呈紫色，发出湿黏而恶心的光。多斯拉克人称其为 “血蝇”。它们居住于沼泽地和死水潭，以吸食人马鲜血为生，并在腐尸或濒死的人畜身上产卵。卓戈恨极了这种生物，每当有血蝇靠近，他的手便如灵蛇般迅速窜出，一把抓住，她从未见他失手过。他会把苍蝇握在巨掌里，听任它狂乱地嗡嗡乱飞，最后才用力捏紧，等张开手，苍蝇已成为他掌心的一滩红印。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5930');"><p>Now one crept across the rump of his stallion, and the horse gave an angry flick of its tail to brush it away. The others flitted about Drogo, closer and closer. The khal did not react. His eyes were fixed on distant brown hills, the reins loose in his hands. Beneath his painted vest, a plaster of fig leaves and caked blue mud covered the wound on his breast. The herbwomen had made it for him. Mirri Maz Duur’s poultice had itched and burned, and he had torn it off six days ago, cursing her for a maegi. The mud plaster was more soothing, and the herbwomen made him poppy wine as well. He’d been drinking it heavily these past three days; when it was not poppy wine, it was fermented mare’s milk or pepper beer.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5930" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，有一只血蝇在他坐骑的臀部爬来爬去，骏马愤怒地甩着尾巴，想把它赶走。其他苍蝇则在卓戈周围来回飞动，越飞越近，然而卡奥却没有反应。他的视线朝向远方的褐色丘陵，缰绳松松垮垮地垂在手中。在他的彩绘背心下，一层无花果叶和干涸的蓝泥覆盖着胸前的伤口，那是草药妇人专为他调臸的。弥丽•马兹•笃尔的药膏不仅灼热，更令他搔痒难耐，因此六天前他便已撕掉膏药，骂她是“巫魔女”。泥膏比较舒服，况且草药妇人还为他调臸了罂粟酒，这三天来他喝得厉害，即便不喝罂粟酒，他也豪饮发酵马奶或胡椒啤酒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5931');"><p>Yet he scarcely touched his food, and he thrashed and groaned in the night. Dany could see how drawn his face had become. Rhaego was restless in her belly, kicking like a stallion, yet even that did not stir Drogo’s interest as it had. Every morning her eyes found fresh lines of pain on his face when he woke from his troubled sleep. And now this silence. It was making her afraid. Since they had mounted up at dawn, he had said not a word. When she spoke, she got no answer but a grunt, and not even that much since midday.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5931" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而他却几乎不碰食物，到了夜里则是又踢打又呻吟。丹妮看得出，他的脸变得好削瘦。雷戈在她的肚子里不断骚动，活像一匹骏马，但丝毫没有引起卓戈的兴趣。每天早上，当他从噩梦中醒来，她便发现他的脸上又多了新的痛苦痕迹。眼下，他竟连话也不说了，使她倍感惊恐。是啊，自从他们日出时出发以来，他连一个字也没有说。即便她主动开口，得到的也只是一声咕哝，过了中午，连咕哝都没了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5932');"><p>One of the bloodflies landed on the bare skin of the khal’s shoulder. Another, circling, touched down on his neck and crept up toward his mouth. Khal Drogo swayed in the saddle, bells ringing, as his stallion kept onward at a steady walking pace.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5932" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一只血蝇降落在卡奥裸露的肩膀上，另外一只则盘旋片刻，停上了他脖子，并朝他嘴巴爬去。卓戈卡奥在马鞍上微微晃动，发际铃铛轻声作响，坐骑则以稳定的步伐继续前进。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5933');"><p>Dany pressed her heels into her silver and rode closer. "My lord," she said softly. "Drogo. My sun-and-stars."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5933" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮夹紧银马，骑到他身旁。“夫君，”她轻声说，“卓戈，我的日和星。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5934');"><p>He did not seem to hear. The bloodfly crawled up under his drooping mustache and settled on his cheek, in the crease beside his nose. Dany gasped, "Drogo." Clumsily she reached over and touched his arm.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5934" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他似乎根本没听见。血蝇顺着他长长的胡子往上爬，爬上脸颊，停在鼻子旁的皱痕里。丹妮惊讶得屏住呼吸。“卓戈，”她笨拙地伸手去扶他的臂膀。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5935');"><p>Khal Drogo reeled in the saddle, tilted slowly, and fell heavily from his horse. The flies scattered for a heartbeat, and then circled back to settle on him where he lay.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5935" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥在马鞍上晃了晃，缓缓倾斜，重重地从马上摔了下去。血蝇群散开了一个心跳的瞬间，随即又徘徊而回，停在他身亡。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5936');"><p>"No," Dany said, reining up. Heedless of her belly for once, she scrambled off her silver and ran to him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5936" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，”丹妮连忙勒住缰绳，不顾自己的大肚子，蹒跚着翻下小银马，奔向他身边。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5937');"><p>The grass beneath him was brown and dry. Drogo cried out in pain as Dany knelt beside him. His breath rattled harshly in his throat, and he looked at her without recognition. "My horse," he gasped. Dany brushed the flies off his chest, smashing one as he would have. His skin burned beneath her fingers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5937" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他身下的草地棕黄干枯。当丹妮在他身边跪下时，卓戈发出痛苦的叫喊。他的呼吸卡在喉咙里，看她的眼神仿佛不认得她。“我的马。”他喘着气说。丹妮挥开他胸膛上的苍蝇，学他的样子捏死了一只。手指下，他的皮肤烫得吓人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5938');"><p>The khal’s bloodriders had been following just behind them. She heard Haggo shout as they galloped up. Cohollo vaulted from his horse. "Blood of my blood," he said as he dropped to his knees. The other two kept to their mounts.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5938" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卡奥的血盟卫就跟在后面。她听见哈戈大喊，他们快马加鞭地赶来。科霍罗自马背一跃而下。“吾血之血”他边跪边喊。其他两人则留在马上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5939');"><p>"No," Khal Drogo groaned, struggling in Dany’s arms. "Must ride. Ride. No."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5939" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，”卓戈卡奥呻吟着在丹妮怀中挣扎。“必须骑马。骑马。不。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5940');"><p>"He fell from his horse," Haggo said, staring down. His broad face was impassive, but his voice was leaden.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5940" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他从自己的马上摔下来。”哈戈瞪着脚下的他们说，他那张阔脸毫无表情，但声音如铅般沉重。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5941');"><p>"You must not say that," Dany told him. "We have ridden far enough today. We will camp here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5941" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别说这种话，”丹妮告诉他，“今天我们骑得也够远了，就在这里扎营。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5942');"><p>"Here?" Haggo looked around them. The land was brown and sere, inhospitable. "This is no camping ground."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5942" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这里?”哈戈环顾四周。此地植物干枯，一片棕黄，不适人居。“这里不能扎营。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5943');"><p>"It is not for a woman to bid us halt," said Qotho, "not even a khaleesi."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5943" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“女人无权命令我们停下，”柯索说，“即便卡丽熙也不例外。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5944');"><p>"We camp here," Dany repeated. "Haggo, tell them Khal Drogo commanded the halt. If any ask why, say to them that my time is near and I could not continue. Cohollo, bring up the slaves, they must put up the khal’s tent at once. Qotho..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5944" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们就在这里扎营。”丹妮重复，“哈戈，传话下去，就说卓戈卡奥命令大家停下。若有人间起原因，就说我快生了，无法再走。科霍罗，把奴隶带来，让他们立刻搭起卡奥的帐篷。柯索——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5945');"><p>"You do not command me, Khaleesi," Qotho said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5945" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“卡丽熙，你无权命令我。”柯索说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5946');"><p>"Find Mirri Maz Duur," she told him. The godswife would be walking among the other Lamb Men, in the long column of slaves. "Bring her to me, with her chest."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5946" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你去把弥丽•马兹•笃尔找来。”她告诉他。女祭司应该和其他“羊人”一起，位于长长的奴隶队伍中。“带她来见我，叫她把药箱也带来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5947');"><p>Qotho glared down at her, his eyes hard as flint. "The maegi." He spat. "This I will not do."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5947" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>柯索从马上瞪着她，两眼刚硬如燧石。“巫魔女，”他啐了一口，“我不干。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5948');"><p>"You will," Dany said, "or when Drogo wakes, he will hear why you defied me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5948" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你立刻去办，”丹妮说，“否则等卓戈醒来，他会想知道你为何忤逆我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5949');"><p>Furious, Qotho wheeled his stallion around and galloped off in anger?.?.?.?but Dany knew he would return with Mirri Maz Duur, however little he might like it. The slaves erected Khal Drogo’s tent beneath a jagged outcrop of black rock whose shadow gave some relief from the heat of the afternoon sun. Even so, it was stifling under the sandsilk as Irri and Doreah helped Dany walk Drogo inside. Thick patterned carpets had been laid down over the ground, and pillows scattered in the corners. Eroeh, the timid girl Dany had rescued outside the mud walls of the Lamb Men, set up a brazier. They stretched Drogo out on a woven mat. "No," he muttered in the Common Tongue. "No, no." It was all he said, all he seemed capable of saying.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5949" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>柯索愤怒地调转马头，飞奔而去……但丹妮知道，无论他多么不情愿，终究是会把弥丽•马兹•笃尔带来的。奴隶们在一片崎岖的黑色岩层下搭起卓戈卡奥的大帐，那里的阴影可以稍稍遮挡午后的骄阳。即便如此，当伊丽和多莉亚协助丹妮搀扶卓戈走进沙丝帐时，里面依旧热得令人窒息。地上铺着厚重的绘画地毯，枕头散置于角落。埃萝叶，那个丹妮在“羊人”城镇的泥墙外解救的羞怯女孩，已经燃起一个火盆。他们让卓戈平躺在草席上。“不，”他用通用语呢喃着，“不，不。”他只说得出这个字，仿佛这是他能力惟一所及。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5950');"><p>Doreah unhooked his medallion belt and stripped off his vest and leggings, while Jhiqui knelt by his feet to undo the laces of his riding sandals. Irri wanted to leave the tent flaps open to let in the breeze, but Dany forbade it. She would not have any see Drogo this way, in delirium and weakness. When her khas came up, she posted them outside at guard. "Admit no one without my leave," she told Jhogo. "No one."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5950" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>多莉亚解开他的奖章腰带，脱下他的背心和绑腿，姬琪则跪在他脚边，为他解开骑马凉鞋。伊丽想让帐篷敞开通风，但丹妮不准，她绝不能让别人看见卓戈神臹不清的虚弱模样。当她的卡斯部众抵达时，她要他们守在门口。“未经我允许，不准任何人进来。”她对乔戈说，“谁都不行。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5951');"><p>Eroeh stared fearfully at Drogo where he lay. "He dies," she whispered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5951" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>埃萝叶畏惧地看着躺在席上的卓戈。“他死了。”她小声说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5952');"><p>Dany slapped her. "The khal cannot die. He is the father of the stallion who mounts the world. His hair has never been cut. He still wears the bells his father gave him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5952" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮抽了她一个耳光。“卡奥不会死，他是骑着世界的骏马之父，他的头发从未修剪，至今依旧绑着他父亲留给他的铃铛。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5953');"><p>"Khaleesi, " Jhiqui said, "he fell from his horse."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5953" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可是，卡丽熙，”姬琪道，“他从自己的马上摔下来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5954');"><p>Trembling, her eyes full of sudden tears, Dany turned away from them. He fell from his horse! It was so, she had seen it, and the bloodriders, and no doubt her handmaids and the men of her khas as well. And how many more? They could not keep it secret, and Dany knew what that meant. A khal who could not ride could not rule, and Drogo had fallen from his horse.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5954" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮眼中突然盈满泪水，她颤抖着别过头去。他从自己的马上摔下来! 的确如此，不仅她亲眼目睹，血盟卫看到了，目击者还包括她的女仆和卡斯部众。除此之外还有多少呢?他们不可能保守秘密，丹妮知道这意味着什么：无法骑马的卡奥便无能统治，而卓戈竟从自己的马上摔了下去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5955');"><p>"We must bathe him," she said stubbornly. She must not allow herself to despair. "Irri, have the tub brought at once. Doreah, Eroeh, find water, cool water, he’s so hot." He was a fire in human skin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5955" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们必须帮他沐浴。”她固执地说。她绝不能让自己陷入绝望。“伊丽，叫人马上把澡盆搬来。多莉亚、埃萝叶，去找水，要凉水，他身体好烫。”他简直是人皮包裹的一团火。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5956');"><p>The slaves set up the heavy copper tub in the corner of the tent. When Doreah brought the first jar of water, Dany wet a length of silk to lay across Drogo’s brow, over the burning skin. His eyes looked at her, but he did not see. When his lips opened, no words escaped them, only a moan. "Where is Mirri Maz Duur?" she demanded, her patience rubbed raw with fear.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5956" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奴隶们将沉重的赤铜澡盆放在帐篷角落。当多莉亚拿来第一罐水时，丹妮浸湿一卷丝布，盖在卓戈滚烫的额际。他双眼直视，却视而不见。他张开嘴巴，却说不出话，只有呻吟。“弥丽•马兹•笃尔在哪儿? ”她的耐心快要被恐惧磨光，忍不住厉声臼问。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5957');"><p>"Qotho will find her," Irri said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5957" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“柯索一定能找到她，”伊丽说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5958');"><p>Her handmaids filled the tub with tepid water that stank of sulfur, sweetening it with jars of bitter oil and handfuls of crushed mint leaves. While the bath was being prepared, Dany knelt awkwardly beside her lord husband, her belly great with their child within. She undid his braid with anxious fingers, as she had on the night he’d taken her for the first time, beneath the stars. His bells she laid aside carefully, one by one. He would want them again when he was well, she told herself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5958" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>女仆们将澡盆灌满散发着硫磺气息的温水，加入几罐苦油和几把捣碎的薄荷叶。在她们准备洗澡水时，身怀六甲的丹妮笨拙地跪在夫君身边，用不安的手指解开他的发辪，一如他在星空下与她初次结合的那个晚上。她小心翼翼地把他的铃铛一个个放好，她告诉自己，等他康复，他需要重新系上这些铃铛。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5959');"><p>A breath of air entered the tent as Aggo poked his head through the silk. "Khaleesi, " he said, "the Andal is come, and begs leave to enter."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5959" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一股空气吹进帐篷，原来是阿戈从丝幕间探头。“卡丽熙，”他说，“安达尔人来了，他请求进来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5960');"><p>"The Andal" was what the Dothraki called Ser Jorah. "Yes," she said, rising clumsily, "send him in." She trusted the knight. He would know what to do if anyone did.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5960" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“安达尔人”是多斯拉克人对乔拉爵士的称呼。“好的，”她笨拙地起身，“让他进来。”她信任这位骑士，假如还有人知道现在该怎么做，那此人非他莫属。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5961');"><p>Ser Jorah Mormont ducked through the door flap and waited a moment for his eyes to adjust to the dimness. In the fierce heat of the south, he wore loose trousers of mottled sandsilk and open-toed riding sandals that laced up to his knee. His scabbard hung from a twisted horsehair belt. Under a bleached white vest, he was bare-chested, skin reddened by the sun. "Talk goes from mouth to ear, all over the khalasar," he said. "It is said Khal Drogo fell from his horse."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5961" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士低头穿过帐门，等了一会儿，使眼睛适应黑暗。在南方的炎热气候下，他穿了宽松的斑纹沙丝长裤，绑到膝盖、露出脚趾的骑马凉鞋，佩剑则挂在一条曲折的马鬃带上。在漂白的背心下，他赤裸胸膛，皮肤因日晒而通红。“到处都是谣言，整个卡拉萨都传辫了。”他说，“据说卓戈卡奥从自己的马上摔下来。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5962');"><p>"Help him," Dany pleaded. "For the love you say you bear me, help him now."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5962" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“帮帮他吧，”丹妮哀求。“看在你承诺过对我的爱份上，帮帮他罢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5963');"><p>The knight knelt beside her. He looked at Drogo long and hard, and then at Dany. "Send your maids away."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5963" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>骑士在她身边跪下，意味深长地审视卓戈良久，最后对丹妮说：“把您的女仆支开。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5964');"><p>Wordlessly, her throat tight with fear, Dany made a gesture. Irri herded the other girls from the tent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5964" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮的喉咙因恐惧而紧绷，她一言不发地打了个手势，伊丽便哄着其他人出了帐篷。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5965');"><p>When they were alone, Ser Jorah drew his dagger. Deftly, with a delicacy surprising in such a big man, he began to scrape away the black leaves and dried blue mud from Drogo’s chest. The plaster had caked hard as the mud walls of the Lamb Men, and like those walls it cracked easily. Ser Jorah broke the dry mud with his knife, pried the chunks from the flesh, peeled off the leaves one by one. A foul, sweet smell rose from the wound, so thick it almost choked her. The leaves were crusted with blood and pus, Drogo’s breast black and glistening with corruption.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5965" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她们离去后，乔拉爵士抽出匕首，熟练地割开卓戈胸膛上的黑叶和于蓝泥，动作之轻巧，难以想像竟是出自如此一位大汉之手。敷料早已干如羊人的泥墙，也像泥墙一样轻易破裂。乔拉爵士用匕首切开干泥，撬掉血肉上的碎块，剥下一片片叶子。一股恶臭甜腻的味道从伤口涌出，浓烈得让她不能呼吸。满地落叶结满了血块和脓疮，卓戈的胸膛一片漆黑，腐烂的伤口闪闪发亮。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5966');"><p>"No," Dany whispered as tears ran down her cheeks. "No, please, gods hear me, no."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5966" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，”丹妮小声说，泪水滚下双颊。“不，求求你，诸神救救我，不要。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5967');"><p>Khal Drogo thrashed, fighting some unseen enemy. Black blood ran slow and thick from his open wound.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5967" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥抽搐了一下，好似在与某个看不见的敌人拼斗。黑色的脓血自他伤口缓缓地流下。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5968');"><p>"Your khal is good as dead, Princess."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5968" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“公主殿下，您的卡奥与死人无异。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5969');"><p>"No, he can’t die, he mustn’t, it was only a cut." Dany took his large callused hand in her own small ones, and held it tight between them. "I will not let him die ?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5969" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，他不能死，他不可以死，这只是个小伤，”丹妮伸出细小的双手，紧紧握住卓戈长满老茧的巨掌。“我不会让他死……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5970');"><p>Ser Jorah gave a bitter laugh. "Khaleesi or queen, that command is beyond your power. Save your tears, child. Weep for him tomorrow, or a year from now. We do not have time for grief. We must go, and quickly, before he dies."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5970" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士苦涩地笑笑。“无论你是卡丽熙还是公主，只怕这个命令都超出了你的能力所及。孩子，请留住你的泪水，明天、或是明年再为他哀悼，眼下我们无暇悲伤。趁他还没断气，我们得赶紧走。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5971');"><p>Dany was lost. "Go? Where should we go?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5971" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮不知所措。“走? 去哪里?”

A crowd had gathered to stare at Dany with hard black eyes, their faces like masks of beaten copper. She saw Ser Jorah Mormont, wearing mail and leather now, sweat beading on his broad, balding forehead. He pushed his way through the Dothraki to Dany’s side.

Ser Jorah parried as best he could, but the slashes came so fast that it seemed to Dany that Qotho had four arakhs and as many arms. She heard the crunch of sword on mail, saw sparks fly as the long curved blade glanced off a gauntlet. Suddenly it was Mormont stumbling backward, and Qotho leaping to the attack. The left side of the knight’s face ran red with blood, and a cut to the hip opened a gash in his mail and left him limping. Qotho screamed taunts at him, calling him a craven, a milk man, a eunuch in an iron suit. "You die now!" he promised, arakh shivering through the red twilight. Inside Dany’s womb, her son kicked wildly. The curved blade slipped past the straight one and bit deep into the knight’s hip where the mail gaped open.

Dany cried out for help, but no one heard. Rakharo was fighting Haggo, arakh dancing with arakh until Jhogo’s whip cracked, loud as thunder, the lash coiling around Haggo’s throat. A yank, and the bloodrider stumbled backward, losing his feet and his sword. Rakharo sprang forward, howling, swinging his arakh down with both hands through the top of Haggo’s head. The point caught between his eyes, red and quivering. Someone threw a stone, and when Dany looked, her shoulder was torn and bloody. "No," she wept, "no, please, stop it, it’s too high, the price is too high." More stones came flying. She tried to crawl toward the tent, but Cohollo caught her. Fingers in her hair, he pulled her head back and she felt the cold touch of his knife at her throat. "My baby," she screamed, and perhaps the gods heard, for as quick as that, Cohollo was dead. Aggo’s arrow took him under the arm, to pierce his lungs and heart.

She tried to rise, and agony seized her and squeezed her like a giant’s fist. The breath went out of her; it was all she could do to gasp.
