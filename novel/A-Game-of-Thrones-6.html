</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_396');"><p>There were times, not many, but a few, when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard. As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_396" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在某些场合——虽然不多，却依旧存在——琼恩•雪诺会暗自庆幸自己是个私生子。当他拿起传来的酒壶，把自己刚喝干的杯子斟满时，他惊觉现在就是这样的场合。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_397');"><p>He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_397" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他返身坐回长凳，和青年侍从们坐在一起，啜饮杯中佳酿。满口夏日红酒甜美的水果香气，牵起他嘴角的一丝微笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_398');"><p>The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and fresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon’s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.
</p></origin><translate id="div_398" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>临冬城的大厅里热气蒸腾，四溢着烤肉和刚出炉的面包所散发的香味。大厅的灰石墙上挂满了各家旗臶，白色是史塔克家族的冰原奔狼，金色是拜拉席恩家族的宝冠雄鹿，绯红则是兰尼斯特家族的怒吼雄狮。大厅里有位歌手正拨弄竖琴，高唱歌谣，然而在炉火熊熊，蜡碟碰撞和酩酊交谈的喧嚣覆盖下，坐在长厅末端的他根本听不清楚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_399');"><p>It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon’s brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and queen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that. Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for.
</p></origin><translate id="div_399" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>为国王接风洗尘而举办的欢迎晚宴，已经进行了整整四个钟头。琼恩的兄弟姐妹和他隔着整个大厅，他们和王子公主们坐在一起，只比史塔克公爵夫妇和国王王后所处的高台低一席。每逢这种特殊场合，他的公爵父亲总会特许每个孩子喝一杯葡萄酒，但不准再多。反倒是像他这样与随从仆役们在一块儿，没人会管他喝多少。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_400');"><p>And he was finding that he had a man’s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass. They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king’s offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon had gotten a good long look at them all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_400" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他发现自己的酒量原来和成人差不多，在身旁这群兴高采烈的年轻人怂恿下，每当喝干一杯，他们就怂恿他再来一杯。琼恩很乐意与他们为伍，津津有味地听他们彼此吹嘘战争、打猎和偷情的故事。他相信这群伙伴绝对比王子公主们有趣。先前当访客们从大门口鱼贯而入时，他已经满足了自己的好奇心。队伍正好从他座位前方不远处经过，他便好好地瞧了个清楚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_401');"><p>His lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes. His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him. Even at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile.
</p></origin><translate id="div_401" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的公爵父亲护送王后走在前面，她正如传闻中那么美丽，镶满宝石的头冠衬着她金色的长发，闪闪发亮，其上镶嵌的翡翠和她璀璨明亮的碧眼搭配得完美无瑕。父亲搀扶她步上高台，引她到席位坐下，然而她自始至终都没正眼瞧他一下。琼恩虽然只有十四岁，但他还是看得出王后的笑容只是表面功夫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_402');"><p>Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king was a great disappointment to Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups.
</p></origin><translate id="div_402" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着是国王本人，他挽着史塔克夫人的手走了进来。琼恩见到国王，只觉大失所望。父亲常说起那个天下无双的勇士劳勃•拜拉席恩，三叉戟河的恶魔，全国最骁勇善战的武士，在王公贵族间卓然不群。可在琼恩眼里，他不过是个红脸长须，汗流浃背的胖子，走起路来一副耽溺杯中物的模样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_403');"><p>After them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. Close behind came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided she was insipid. Robb didn’t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool.
</p></origin><translate id="div_403" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在他之后进来的是孩子们，小瑞肯走在第一，很努力地要装出三岁小孩所能表现出来的庄严姿态。他走到琼恩面前时还停下来打招呼，琼恩只得催促他快走。罗柏紧跟在后，他穿着象征史塔克家族色彩的灰绒白边羊毛衣，挽着弥赛菈公主的手。她还是个小女孩，年纪不满八岁，珠光宝气的发网内金色卷发有如瀑布般流泻直下。他们经过时，琼恩注意到她看着罗柏时的羞赧微笑。他的结论是这女孩八成挺无趣。不过罗柏根本就没发现她有多蠢，他自己也看着她，笑得像个傻子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_404');"><p>His half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose white-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, Joffrey Baratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon’s vast dismay. Prince Joffrey had his sister’s hair and his mother’s deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon did not like Joffrey’s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell’s Great Hall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_404" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着他的两个异母妹妹也护送王子们进来了，艾莉亚和胖嘟嘟的托曼王子走在一块儿，他那白金色的长发比她的头发还要长。大她两岁的珊莎则陪着王太子乔佛里•拜拉席恩。乔佛里今年十二岁，年纪比琼恩和罗柏都小，长得却比两人都要高，琼恩想到这就不痛快。乔佛里王子有妹妹的长发和母亲的深邃碧眼，金色的发卷盖过金色宽领带和高贵的天鹅绒衣领，珊莎走在他身旁，容光焕发。不过琼恩可一点也不喜欢乔佛里那副嘴唇上噘，对临冬城大厅轻蔑鄙夷的神态。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_405');"><p>He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen’s brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which. Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered "Kingslayer" behind his back.
</p></origin><translate id="div_405" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他对走在王太子后面的这一对比较感兴趣：他们是王后的兄弟，都是凯岩城兰尼斯特家的人。任何人都不会把谁是“雄狮”，谁又是“小恶魔”给弄混的。詹姆•兰尼斯特爵士是瑟曦王后的孪生手足，生得高大英挺，金发飘扬，有着闪亮的碧眼和利如刀锋的笑容。他穿着大红丝臼长衫，漆黑高统靴和黑缎长披风。上衣的前胸用金线绣了只兰尼斯特家怒吼不驯的雄狮。人们称他“兰尼斯特雄狮”，又在背后窃窃私语“弑君者”这个名号。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_406');"><p>Jon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as the man passed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_406" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩发觉自己几乎无法将视线自他身上抽离。这才是王者应有的风范，詹姆走过面前时，他如此暗想。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_407');"><p>Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother’s side. Tyrion Lannister, the youngest of Lord Tywin’s brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, they had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his brother’s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. His head was too large for his body, with a brute’s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. One green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. Jon watched him with fascination.
</p></origin><translate id="div_407" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着他望向詹姆的兄弟，他正摇摇摆摆、半躲藏地走在哥哥身边。提利昂•兰尼斯特是泰温公爵年纪最小，也最丑陋的孩子。诸神赐予瑟曦和詹姆的一切优点，一样都没留给提利昂。他是个身高只有哥哥一半的侏儒，鼓动着畸形的双腿努力想跟上哥哥的脚步。他的头大得不合比例，鼓胀额头下是一张扭曲的怪脸。双眼一碧一黑，从满头长直金发下面向外窥视，他头发的颜色几乎金亮成白。琼恩饶富兴味地看着他打面前经过。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_408');"><p>The last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night’s Watch, and his father’s ward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by. Theon ignored him utterly, but there was nothing new in that. After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and returned, and then the feasting began.
</p></origin><translate id="div_408" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>达官贵胄中最后进来的是他叔叔，守夜人部队的班扬•史塔克，以及父亲年轻的养子席恩•葛雷乔伊。班扬经过时对他露出温和的微笑，席恩则对他完全视若无睹，不过这也不是一两天的事情了。等贵宾全部就座之后，大家彼此举杯祝福，互致贺词，然后晚宴便正式开始。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_409');"><p>Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped.
</p></origin><translate id="div_409" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩从那时起就在喝酒，到现在还没停下。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_410');"><p>Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at him. "Hungry again?" he asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs. Ghost ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too.
</p></origin><translate id="div_410" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>长桌下有东西摩擦他的脚，低头只见一对红眼睛盯着他望。“肚子又饿了？”他问。餐桌中间还有半只蜜汁烤鸡，琼恩伸手撕下一只鸡腿，突然心生一计，用餐刀把整只鸡的肉切割下来，然后让剩余的鸡骨从自己双腿间滑到地上。“白灵”野蛮却安静地撕咬起骨头。他的兄妹们都不准带狼进宴会厅，惟有琼恩所处的大厅尾端，狗多得数不清，自然也没人管他的小狼。他告诉自己这也算专有的好福气。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_411');"><p>His eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken.
</p></origin><translate id="div_411" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>眼睛突然一阵刺痛，琼恩粗鲁地揉揉，咒骂着熏烟。他又喝了一大口葡萄酒，然后看着白灵吞噬了整只鸡。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_412');"><p>Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share. Jon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three times the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. Ghost went back to his meal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_412" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>狗们在餐桌间来回走动，跟着女侍四处逡巡。其中有一只长着大大的黄眼睛的黑色混血母狗闻到了鸡肉香味，便停下脚步，低身挤过长椅想要分一杯羹。琼恩冷眼旁观双方对臷，只见那母狗喉头发出低吼，慢慢靠近。白灵则沉默地抬头，用那双血红的眼睛冷冷瞪视对方。母狗发出一声愤怒的挑衅，她的身躯是小冰原狼的三倍，但白灵却动也不动，只霸占住自己的食物，张开嘴巴，露出尖牙。母狗见状，又吠了一声，最后决定这场架还是不打为妙。于是它转身溜走，离去前还不忘傲慢地吠了一声以维持自尊。白灵继续低头猛嚼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_413');"><p>Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating.
</p></origin><translate id="div_413" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩得意地笑着，探手到桌底摸摸它一身蓬松的白绒毛。小狼抬起头望他，温柔地咬了他的手一口，然后又低头大快朵颐。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_414');"><p>"Is this one of the direwolves I’ve heard so much of?" a familiar voice asked close at hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_414" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这就是大名鼎鼎的冰原狼吗？”一个熟悉的声音在身旁问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_415');"><p>Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf’s. "Yes," he said. "His name is Ghost."
</p></origin><translate id="div_415" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩开心地抬头，班叔叔把手放在他头上，拨弄着他的头发，就好像他刚才拨弄白灵身上的毛一样。“对，”他回答，“它叫做白灵。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_416');"><p>One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he’d been telling to make room at the table for their lord’s brother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon’s hand. "Summerwine," he said after a taste. "Nothing so sweet. How many cups have you had, Jon?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_416" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一名正说着低级故事的侍从停下来，挪出位置给公爵的弟弟坐。班扬•史塔克跨坐上长凳，从琼恩手里接过酒杯。“夏日红，”他尝了一口后缓缓地说，“没有东西比得上这酒甜美。琼恩，你今晚喝了几杯？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_417');"><p>Jon smiled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_417" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩笑而不答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_418');"><p>Ben Stark laughed. "As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk." He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into it. It crunched.
</p></origin><translate id="div_418" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>班扬•史塔克笑道：“果不出我所料。呵呵，算了。记得我自己第一次喝得酩酊大醉时，年纪比你还小。”他从旁边木餐盘里拣起一颗滴着棕色肉汁的烤洋葱，一口咬将下去，发出松脆的喀嚓声响。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_419');"><p>His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night’s Watch. Tonight it was rich black velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped round his neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. "A very quiet wolf," he observed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_419" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的叔叔容貌锐利，瘦削有如危岩嶙峋，但他灰蓝色的眼睛里永远带着笑意。他和所有守夜人一样一袭黑衣，今晚他身着厚实的天鹅绒长衫，脚穿皮里高统靴，腰系宽边皮带和镀银扣环，脖间还戴了串沉甸甸的银项链。班扬一边吃洋葱，一边兴味盎然地看着白灵。“很安静的一只狼。”他做出结论。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_420');"><p>"He’s not like the others," Jon said. "He never makes a sound. That’s why I named him Ghost. That, and because he’s white. The others are all dark, grey or black."
</p></origin><translate id="div_420" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“它和其他几只很不一样，”琼恩说，“从来都一声不吭，所以我才叫它白灵，这也是因为它的毛色，其他几只狼毛色都很深，不是灰就是黑。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_421');"><p>"There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings." Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look. "Don’t you usually eat at table with your brothers?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_421" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“长城外也有冰原狼，我们外出巡逻时经常听到它们的嚎叫。”班扬•史塔克意味深长地看着琼恩，“你平日不是都和你弟弟他们同桌吃饭吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_422');"><p>"Most times," Jon answered in a flat voice. "But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_422" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那是平日，”琼恩语调平板地回答，“夫人认为，今晚若让私生子与他们同桌用餐，对王族是种侮辱。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_423');"><p>"I see." His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall. "My brother does not seem very festive tonight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_423" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“原来如此。”叔叔转头看看大厅尽头高台上的餐桌，“我哥哥今晚看上去不太有庆祝的兴致。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_424');"><p>Jon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes. His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture. "The queen is angry too," Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. "Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn’t want him to go."
</p></origin><translate id="div_424" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩也注意到了，私生子必须学会察言观色，洞悉隐藏在人们眼里的喜怒哀乐。他父亲固然举止都合乎礼数，但神情里却有种琼恩从未见过的拘束。他不多说话，始终用低低的眼神扫视全厅，目光十分空洞。隔着两个位子的国王倒是整晚开怀畅饮，络腮胡后那张大脸胀得通红，他不断地举杯敬酒，听了每一个笑话都乐得前仰后合，每一道菜他都像个饿鬼似地吃个不休。但坐在他身旁的王后却如一尊冰冷的雕像。“王后也在生气，”琼恩低声对他叔叔说，“下午父亲大人带国王去了地下陵寝，王后本不希望他去的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_425');"><p>Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. "You don’t miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man like you on the Wall."
</p></origin><translate id="div_425" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>班扬仔细地审视了琼恩一番，说：“琼恩，什么事都逃不过你眼光，是么？我们长城守军很需要你这样的人才。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_426');"><p>Jon swelled with pride. "Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I’m the better sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle."
</p></origin><translate id="div_426" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩骄傲地说：“罗柏用起长枪来比我有力，但是我剑使得比较好，胡伦还说我的骑术在城里也是数一数二。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_427');"><p>"Notable achievements."
</p></origin><translate id="div_427" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“的确很不容易。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_428');"><p>"Take me with you when you go back to the Wall," Jon said in a sudden rush. "Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will."
</p></origin><translate id="div_428" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你回去的时候，带我一道走罢。”琼恩突然激动起来，“只要你去跟父亲大人说，他一定会同意，我知道他一定会。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_429');"><p>Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully. "The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_429" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>班扬叔叔再度审视他的脸庞，“琼恩，对一个男孩子来说，长城是个很艰苦的地方。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_430');"><p>"I am almost a man grown," Jon protested. "I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children."
</p></origin><translate id="div_430" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我差不多成年了，”琼恩辩解，“下个命名日我就满十五岁，而且鲁温师傅说私生子会比其他孩子长得快。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_431');"><p>"That’s true enough," Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon’s cup from the table, filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow.
</p></origin><translate id="div_431" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这倒是真的。”班扬的嘴角向下微翘，他从桌上拿起琼恩的酒杯，斟满葡萄酒，深吸一口。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_432');"><p>"Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne," Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_432" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“戴伦•坦格利安征服多恩领的时候也不过十四岁。”琼恩又说。传说中的年轻龙王是他心目中的英雄。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_433');"><p>"A conquest that lasted a summer," his uncle pointed out. "Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn’t a game." He took another sip of wine. "Also," he said, wiping his mouth, "Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died. Or have you forgotten that part?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_433" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那场仗可是打了一整个夏天，”叔叔提醒道，“你说的这个年轻国王，为了攻下多恩，死了一万人，后来为了守住它，又死了五万人。应该有人告诉他，战争可不是儿戏。”他又啜了口酒，抹抹嘴，“而且，戴伦•坦格利安十八岁就英年早逝，你该不会忘记这一部分吧？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_434');"><p>"I forget nothing," Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller. "I want to serve in the Night’s Watch, Uncle."
</p></origin><translate id="div_434" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我什么都没忘，”琼恩吹嘘，酒精让他胆子也大了起来。他试着坐直身子，好让自己看起来更高大，“叔叔，我想进入守夜人部队服役。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_435');"><p>He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon would be Robb’s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_440');"><p>"You might, if you knew what it meant," Benjen said. "If you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_442');"><p>Benjen Stark stood up. "More’s the pity." He put a hand on Jon’s shoulder. "Come back to me after you’ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we’ll see how you feel."
</p></origin><translate id="div_442" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>班扬•史塔克站起身，“我就可惜你不是我孩子。”他拍拍琼恩肩膀，“等你在外面生了两三个私生子，再来找我，到时候看看自己会有什么想法。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_443');"><p>Jon trembled. "I will never father a bastard," he said carefully. "Never!" He spat it out like venom.
</p></origin><translate id="div_443" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩浑身颤抖。“我绝不会在外面生什么私生子，”他一字一顿地说，“永远不会！”他将最后一句话当成毒液般吐出口。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_444');"><p>Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet.
</p></origin><translate id="div_444" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时他惊觉全桌的人不知什么时候都静了下来，所有人都盯着他。他只觉泪水充满眼眶，最后他站了起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_445');"><p>"I must be excused," he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and bolted before they could see him cry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night.
</p></origin><translate id="div_445" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“恕我先告退。”他用最后一丝尊严说道，然后趁其他人看到他眼泪掉下之前，旋风似地跑开。他一定是喝多了，两只脚仿佛打了结，当即与一位女侍撞个满怀，使一壶掺香料的葡萄酒泼洒在地，四座顿时响起哄堂大笑。琼恩眼中的热泪滚下面颊，有人想搀他，但他甩开善意的手，凭着辨不清地面的眼睛，继续朝大门跑去。白灵紧随其后，奔进低垂的夜幕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_446');"><p>The yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but Jon would have traded places with him in an instant. Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. Jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there. Winterfell reminded him of that tonight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_446" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>空荡的庭院分外寂静，内墙城垛上只有一位拉紧斗篷抵御寒意的守卫，独自蜷缩墙角，虽然看上去百无聊赖，表情悲苦，但琼恩却有一千个一万个想和他交换位置的愿望。除此之外，整座孤城四下漆黑，满是寂寥。琼恩曾去过一座被遗弃的庄园，那里杳无人迹、沉默阴郁，四下一片肃然，惟有巨石在默默倾诉过往主人的景况。今夜的临冬城便让琼恩联想起当时的情景。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_447');"><p>The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. They were the last things Jon wanted to hear. He wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go.
</p></origin><translate id="div_447" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>笙歌舞乐从身后敞开的窗户向外流泻，正是他此刻最不想听的靡靡之音。他用衣袖抹去泪水，气恼自己如何把持不住，随后准备转身离开。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_448');"><p>"Boy," a voice called out to him. Jon turned.
</p></origin><translate id="div_448" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小子。”有人叫住他。琼恩转头。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_449');"><p>Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. "Is that animal a wolf?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_449" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂•兰尼斯特正坐在厅堂前门上面突出的壁架上，睥睨世间万物，活像只石像鬼。这侏儒朝他笑笑：“你身旁那家伙可是只狼？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_450');"><p>"A direwolf," Jon said. "His name is Ghost." He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly forgotten. "What are you doing up there? Why aren’t you at the feast?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_450" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是冰原狼。”琼恩说，“叫做白灵。”他抬头望着侏儒，先前的不满被好奇取而代之。“你在那儿做什么？怎没在里面参加晚宴呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_451');"><p>"Too hot, too noisy, and I’d drunk too much wine," the dwarf told him. "I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your wolf?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_451" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“里面太热太吵，我又多喝了点酒。”侏儒告诉他，“很久以前，我就学到了一个教训：在你的哥哥身上呕吐是件不太礼貌的事。我可以靠近瞧瞧你那只狼吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_452');"><p>Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly. "Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_452" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩迟疑了一下，然后缓缓点头：“你能自己下来么？还是要我去弄张梯子？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_453');"><p>"Oh, bleed that," the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_453" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“去，瞧不起我啊？”小个子说。他两手往后一用力，整个人翻腾进半空中。琼恩惊讶得喘不过气，瞠目结舌地看着提利昂紧缩成一个球，轻巧地以手着地，然后后空翻站起身。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_454');"><p>Ghost backed away from him uncertainly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_454" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>白灵有些迟疑地向后退了几步。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_455');"><p>The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. "I believe I’ve frightened your wolf. My apologies."
</p></origin><translate id="div_455" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>侏儒拍拍身上的灰尘，笑道：“我想我一定是吓着你的小狼了。真不好意思。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_456');"><p>"He’s not scared," Jon said. He knelt and called out. "Ghost, come here. Come on. That’s it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_456" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他才没被吓着。”琼恩边说边弯身唤道：“白灵，过来，快过来，乖。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_457');"><p>The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon’s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. "Shy, isn’t he?" Lannister observed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_457" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小狼溜达过来，亲热地用鼻子摩擦琼恩的脸颊，却始终对提利昂•兰尼斯特保持警戒。当侏儒伸手想摸它时，它立刻抽身后退，露出利齿，发出无声的咆哮。“挺怕生的么？”兰尼斯特说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_458');"><p>"Sit, Ghost," Jon commanded. "That’s it. Keep still." He looked up at the dwarf. "You can touch him now. He won’t move until I tell him to. I’ve been training him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_458" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“白灵，坐下。”琼恩命令，“就是这样，坐着别乱动。”他抬头望向侏儒，“你现在可以摸他了。除非我叫它动，否则他不会乱动的。我正在训练他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_459');"><p>"I see," Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost’s ears and said, "Nice wolf."
</p></origin><translate id="div_459" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“原来如此。”兰尼斯特搔搔白灵两耳间白如细雪的绒毛，“乖狼狼。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_460');"><p>"If I wasn’t here, he’d tear out your throat," Jon said. It wasn’t actually true yet, but it would be.
</p></origin><translate id="div_460" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“若我不在这里，他早把你的喉咙撕开了。”琼恩说。其实这话当下还不能成真，不过看小狼的长势却也为时不远。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_461');"><p>"In that case, you had best stay close," the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. "I am Tyrion Lannister."
</p></origin><translate id="div_461" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果这样，那你还是别走开的好。”侏儒答道。他歪了歪那颗过大的脑袋，用那双大小不一的眼睛仔细打量琼恩，“我是提利昂•兰尼斯特。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_462');"><p>"I know," Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange.
</p></origin><translate id="div_462" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道。”琼恩边说边起身。他站着比那侏儒高多了，不禁觉得很怪异。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_463');"><p>"You’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_463" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你是奈德•史塔克的私生子吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_464');"><p>Jon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_464" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩只觉得一股寒意刺进全身，他抿紧嘴唇，没有答话。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_465');"><p>"Did I offend you?" Lannister said. "Sorry. Dwarfs don’t have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head." He grinned. "You are the bastard, though."
</p></origin><translate id="div_465" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我冒犯到你了吗？”兰尼斯特忙道，“抱歉，侏儒向来不太懂得察言观色。反正历来杂耍卖艺的侏儒前辈们个个衣着随便，口无遮拦，我也就有样学样啦。”他嘿嘿笑着，“不过你确实是个私生子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_466');"><p>"Lord Eddard Stark is my father," Jon admitted stiffly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_466" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“艾德•史塔克大人是我父亲没错。”琼恩终于还是承认了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_467');"><p>Lannister studied his face. "Yes," he said. "I can see it. You have more of the north in you than your brothers."
</p></origin><translate id="div_467" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯，”兰尼斯特端详着他的脸，“看得出来。跟你那些兄弟相比，你还比较有北方人的味道。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_468');"><p>"Half brothers," Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf’s comment, but he tried not to let it show.
</p></origin><translate id="div_468" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“同父异母的兄弟。”琼恩纠正，心里暗暗为侏儒的说法感到高兴。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_469');"><p>"Let me give you some counsel, bastard," Lannister said. "Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_469" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么私生子小弟，让我给你一点建议罢。”兰尼斯特道，“永远不要忘记自己是什么人，因为这个世界不会忘记。你要化阻力为助力，如此一来才没有弱点。用它来武装自己，就没有人可以用它来伤害你。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_470');"><p>Jon was in no mood for anyone’s counsel. "What do you know about being a bastard?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_470" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩可没心情听人说教：“你又知道身为私生子是什么样了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_471');"><p>"All dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes."
</p></origin><translate id="div_471" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“全天下的侏儒，在他们父亲眼里都跟私生子没两样。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_472');"><p>"You are your mother’s trueborn son of Lannister."
</p></origin><translate id="div_472" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你可是你母亲的亲生儿子，地地道道的兰尼斯特。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_473');"><p>"Am I?" the dwarf replied, sardonic. "Do tell my lord father. My mother died birthing me, and he’s never been sure."
</p></origin><translate id="div_473" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是么？”侏儒苦笑，“这话你去跟我父亲大人说吧。我妈生我的时候难产而死，所以我老爸始终不确定我是不是他亲生的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_474');"><p>"I don’t even know who my mother was," Jon said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_474" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我连我母亲是谁都不知道。”琼恩道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_475');"><p>"Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are." He favored Jon with a rueful grin. "Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs." And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_475" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“反正是个女人。”他朝琼恩露出一抹哀伤的笑容，“小子，请记住，虽然全天下的侏儒都可能被视为私生子，私生子却不见得要被人视为侏儒。”说完，他转过身，驼着背返回宴会大厅，嘴里还哼起一首爱情小调。当他打开门的刹那，室内的灯光将他的背影清楚地洒在庭院中。就在那一瞬间，提利昂•兰尼斯特的身影宛如帝王般昂首挺立。
