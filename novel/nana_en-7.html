</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1304');"><p>One December evening three months afterward Count Muffat was strolling in the Passage des Panoramas. The evening was very mild, and owing to a passing shower, the passage had just become crowded with people. There was a perfect mob of them, and they thronged slowly and laboriously along between the shops on either side. Under the windows, white with reflected light, the pavement was violently illuminated. A perfect stream of brilliancy emanated from white globes, red lanterns, blue transparencies, lines of gas jets, gigantic watches and fans, outlined in flame and burning in the open. And the motley displays in the shops, the gold ornaments of the jeweler's, the glass ornaments of the confectioner's, the light-colored silks of the modiste's, seemed to shine again in the crude light of the reflectors behind the clear plate-glass windows, while among the bright-colored, disorderly array of shop signs a huge purple glove loomed in the distance like a bleeding hand which had been severed from an arm and fastened to a yellow cuff.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1304" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>三个月后，十二月的一天夜晚，缪法伯爵漫步在全景胡同里。那天晚上，气温宜人，刚刚下了一阵暴雨，行人都到胡同里来避雨。那儿人满为患，店铺之间，行人拥挤不堪，形成一条长蛇阵，人们只能艰难地缓缓而行。白色的球形灯罩、红色的灯笼、蓝色的透明画、一排排脚灯、用灯管做成的巨大手表和扇子的模型发出一道道耀眼夺目的光芒，把玻璃橱窗照得通明。橱窗里的商品五颜六色，珠宝店的黄金制品，糖果店的水晶玻璃器皿，时装店的鲜艳丝绸，在反射镜的强光照射下，映在明洁的镜子里。在五光十色、杂乱无章的招牌中，远处有一个招牌清晰可见，上面的图案是一只紫红色的手套，酷似一只砍下来的手，血淋淋的，被拴在一只黄色的袖口上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1305');"><p>Count Muffat had slowly returned as far as the boulevard. He glanced out at the roadway and then came sauntering back along the shopwindows. The damp and heated atmosphere filled the narrow passage with a slight luminous mist. Along the flagstones, which had been wet by the drip-drop of umbrellas, the footsteps of the crowd rang continually, but there was no sound of voices. Passers-by elbowed him at every turn and cast inquiring looks at his silent face, which the gaslight rendered pale. And to escape these curious manifestations the count posted himself in front of a stationer's, where with profound attention contemplated an array of paperweights in the form of glass bowls containing floating landscapes and flowers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1305" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>缪法伯爵慢悠悠地走到大街上，他向马路上望了一眼，然后又沿着店铺，慢慢走回来。湿热的空气在狭窄的胡同里凝结成明亮的水气。石板地被从雨伞上滴下来的水淋得湿漉漉的，只听见上面响着行人的脚步声，街上听不见一个人讲话。每当他与行人擦肩而过，行人都要对他打量一番，他的脸总是板着，被煤气灯照得灰白。于是，为了避开行人的好奇目光，缪法伯爵伫立在一家文具店门前，出神地欣赏玻璃橱窗里的玻璃球镇纸，球里浮现着山水和花草。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1306');"><p>He was conscious of nothing: he was thinking of Nana. Why had she lied to him again? That morning she had written and told him not to trouble about her in the evening, her excuse being that Louiset was ill and that she was going to pass the night at her aunt's in order to nurse him. But he had felt suspicious and had called at her house, where he learned from the porter that Madame had just gone off to her theater. He was astonished at this, for she was not playing in the new piece. Why then should she have told him this falsehood, and what could she be doing at the Varietes that evening? Hustled by a passer-by, the count unconsciously left the paperweights and found himself in front of a glass case full of toys, where he grew absorbed over an array of pocketbooks and cigar cases, all of which had the same blue swallow stamped on one corner. Nana was most certainly not the same woman! In the early days after his return from the country she used to drive him wild with delight, as with pussycat caresses she kissed him all round his face and whiskers and vowed that he was her own dear pet and the only little man she adored. He was no longer afraid of Georges, whom his mother kept down at Les Fondettes. There was only fat Steiner to reckon with, and he believed he was really ousting him, but he did not dare provoke an explanation on his score. He knew he was once more in an extraordinary financial scrape and on the verge of being declared bankrupt on 'change, so much so that he was clinging fiercely to the shareholders in the Landes Salt Pits and striving to sweat a final subscription out of them. Whenever he met him at Nana's she would explain reasonably enough that she did not wish to turn him out of doors like a dog after all he had spent on her. Besides, for the last three months he had been living in such a whirl of sensual excitement that, beyond the need of possessing her, he had felt no very distinct impressions. His was a tardy awakening of the fleshly instinct, a childish greed of enjoyment, which left no room for either vanity or jealousy. Only one definite feeling could affect him now, and that was Nana's decreasing kindness. She no longer kissed him on the beard! It made him anxious, and as became a man quite ignorant of womankind, he began asking himself what possible cause of offense he could have given her. Besides, he was under the impression that he was satisfying all her desires. And so he harked back again and again to the letter he had received that morning with its tissue of falsehoods, invented for the extremely simple purpose of passing an evening at her own theater. The crowd had pushed him forward again, and he had crossed the passage and was puzzling his brain in front of the entrance to a restaurant, his eyes fixed on some plucked larks and on a huge salmon laid out inside the window.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1306" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其实他什么也没有看见，他在想娜娜。她为什么再次说谎呢？早上，她给他写了一封信，叫他晚上别来打扰她，借口说小路易病了，她要到姑妈家过夜，以便照料他。可是伯爵起了疑心，他跑到娜娜那里，从门房那里知道娜娜到剧院去了。他对这件事感到诧异，因为她在新上演的戏中没有扮演角色。她为什么要说谎呢？今晚她在游艺剧院里干什么呢？ 伯爵被一个行人挤了一下，但他并没有在意。他离开了镇纸橱窗，站到一个小摆设橱窗前面，全神贯注着里面陈列的笔记本和雪茄烟盒，这些东西的一个角上都印着一只蓝燕子的图案。毫无疑问，娜娜变了。她从乡下回来后的最初几天里，她几乎把他搞疯了，她吻遍他的脸，吻他的胡子，像母猫一样的温柔。她还向他发誓，说他是她最爱的小狗，她唯一钟爱的男人。他再也不担心乔治来了，因为乔治被他妈妈留在丰岱特庄园了。现在只剩下胖子斯泰内，伯爵想取他而代之，但他又不敢对他公开说出来。他知道，斯泰内在经济上重新陷入极度困境之中，在交易所里几乎破了产，现在便拼命抓住朗德盐场的股东们，竭力从他们身上榨取最后一笔钱。他每次在娜娜家碰见斯泰内时，娜娜总是用合乎情理的口气对他说，斯泰内为她花了那么多钱，她还不想把他像条狗一样赶出去。另外，三个月来，他生活在昏昏欲醉的性生活中，除了占有娜娜，他不再有别的什么明显需要。因为他的肉欲迟迟才觉醒，他像贪吃的儿童一样，心目中根本不存在虚荣和嫉妒。现在唯一的明显感觉令他震惊：娜娜不那么热情了，她不再吻他的胡子了。这使他忐忑不安。他思量着，他是一个不大了解女人的人，他究竟有什么地方不能满她的意。不过，他认为自己已经满足了她的所有欲望。他又想到早上那封信，想到她编造谎言把事情搞得复杂了，其实，她的目的很简单，只不过到剧院去过一夜。人群中又拥挤起来，他被挤到胡同对面，站在一家餐馆的门厅前面，苦苦思索着，眼睛瞅着一个橱窗里煺了毛的云雀和一条横放着的大鲑鱼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1307');"><p>At length he seemed to tear himself away from this spectacle. He shook himself, looked up and noticed that it was close on nine o'clock. Nana would soon be coming out, and he would make her tell the truth. And with that he walked on and recalled to memory the evenings he once passed in that region in the days when he used to meet her at the door of the theater.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1307" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>最后他仿佛不再注意橱窗里的那些东西了。他振作起来，抬头一看，发觉快到九点钟了。娜娜马上就出来，他将要求她把真实想法说出来。接着他又踱起步来，他一边走，一边回忆起以往晚上到这里来接娜娜的情景。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1308');"><p>He knew all the shops, and in the gas-laden air he recognized their different scents, such, for instance, as the strong savor of Russia leather, the perfume of vanilla emanating from a chocolate dealer's basement, the savor of musk blown in whiffs from the open doors of the perfumers. But he did not dare linger under the gaze of the pale shopwomen, who looked placidly at him as though they knew him by sight. For one instant he seemed to be studying the line of little round windows above the shops, as though he had never noticed them before among the medley of signs. Then once again he went up to the boulevard and stood still a minute or two. A fine rain was now falling, and the cold feel of it on his hands calmed him. He thought of his wife who was staying in a country house near Macon, where her friend Mme de Chezelles had been ailing a good deal since the autumn. The carriages in the roadway were rolling through a stream of mud. The country, he thought, must be detestable in such vile weather. But suddenly he became anxious and re-entered the hot, close passage down which he strode among the strolling people. A thought struck him: if Nana were suspicious of his presence there she would be off along the Galerie Montmartre.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1308" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这里的每个店铺他都熟悉，在充满煤气味的空气中，他能辨别出每个店铺的气味，如俄罗斯皮革的浓重的气味，从巧克力店的地下室里飘上来的香草味，从化妆品店的敞开的大门里散发出来的麝香味。柜台里脸色苍白的女店员似乎都认识他，时常静静地盯着他看，所以他不敢在她们面前停留。有一阵子，他似乎在研究商店上面的一排小圆窗户，好像在杂乱无章的招牌中，第一次看见那一排小圆窗户。随后，他又一次走到大街上，在那儿站了一会儿。雨已变成了毛毛细雨，落在他的手上，他感到凉冰冰的，这时他才镇静下来。现在，他想到了他的妻子，她住在马孔附近的一座古堡里，她的女友德谢泽勒夫人也住在古堡里，从秋天起，她病得很厉害；马路上的马车，像在泥泞般的河道中间行驶，这样的鬼天气，在乡下就糟糕了。这时，他突然不安起来，他再次回到闷热的胡同里，他在人群中大步流星地走着，因为他忽然想到，如果娜娜戒备他，她可能会从蒙马特长廊那边溜走。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1309');"><p>After that the count kept a sharp lookout at the very door of the theater, though he did not like this passage end, where he was afraid of being recognized. It was at the corner between the Galerie des Varietes and the Galerie Saint-Marc, an equivocal corner full of obscure little shops. Of these last one was a shoemaker's, where customers never seemed to enter. Then there were two or three upholsterers', deep in dust, and a smoky, sleepy reading room and library, the shaded lamps in which cast a green and slumberous light all the evening through. There was never anyone in this corner save well-dressed, patient gentlemen, who prowled about the wreckage peculiar to a stage door, where drunken sceneshifters and ragged chorus girls congregate. In front of the theater a single gas jet in a ground-glass globe lit up the doorway. For a moment or two Muffat thought of questioning Mme Bron; then he grew afraid lest Nana should get wind of his presence and escape by way of the boulevard. So he went on the march again and determined to wait till he was turned out at the closing of the gates, an event which had happened on two previous occasions. The thought of returning home to his solitary bed simply wrung his heart with anguish. Every time that golden-haired girls and men in dirty linen came out and stared at him he returned to his post in front of the reading room, where, looking in between two advertisements posted on a windowpane, he was always greeted by the same sight. It was a little old man, sitting stiff and solitary at the vast table and holding a green newspaper in his green hands under the green light of one of the lamps. But shortly before ten o'clock another gentleman, a tall, good-looking, fair man with well-fitting gloves, was also walking up and down in front of the stage door. Thereupon at each successive turn the pair treated each other to a suspicious sidelong glance. The count walked to the corner of the two galleries, which was adorned with a high mirror, and when he saw himself therein, looking grave and elegant, he was both ashamed and nervous.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1309" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从那时候起，伯爵就跑到剧院门口窥伺着。他不愿在胡同口等候，生怕有人认出他来。这里是游艺剧院的走廊和圣马克走廊的交汇处，光线暗淡，店铺里黑洞洞的，有一家无顾客光顾的鞋店，几家家具上积满灰尘的家具店，还有一间烟雾腾腾的令人昏昏欲睡的阅览室，晚上，罩在灯罩里的灯发出绿色的光亮；那里是演员、醉酒的置景工人和衣衫褴褛的群众演员的进口处，只有衣著齐整、耐心十足的先生们在那里游荡。在剧院前面，只有一盏灯罩粗糙的煤气灯照亮着大门。有一阵子，缪法想去问一下布龙太太，接着又担心起来，怕娜娜听到风声，从马路那边溜走。他又踱着步子，决心一直等到关栅栏门时，人家把他赶走为止，这样的事他已经历过两次了。一想到回去孤寂一人上床睡觉，不禁心中凄凄然。每当有不戴帽子的姑娘和衣衫肮脏的男人走出来，上下打量着他时，他便回到阅览室前面，伫立在那儿，从贴在玻璃窗上的两张广告中间向里面张望，映入他眼帘的还是同样景象：一个小老头子独自一人僵直地坐在一张硕大无朋的桌子边，在绿色的灯光下，用绿色的双手捧着一张绿色的报纸阅读着。但是，在十点还缺几分钟的时候，来了另一位先生，他高高的个儿，相貌标致，一头金发，戴着一副不大不小的手套，他也在剧院门口徘徊着。他们两人每次相遇时，都用怀疑的神色斜着眼看对方一下。伯爵一直走到两条走廊的交汇处，那儿有一面高大的镜子；他对着镜子，发觉自己表情严肃，举止得体，顿时产生羞愧、恐惧之感。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1310');"><p>Ten o'clock struck, and suddenly it occurred to Muffat that it would be very easy to find out whether Nana were in her dressing room or not. He went up the three steps, crossed the little yellow-painted lobby and slipped into the court by a door which simply shut with a latch. At that hour of the night the narrow, damp well of a court, with its pestiferous water closets, its fountain, its back view of the kitchen stove and the collection of plants with which the portress used to litter the place, was drenched in dark mist; but the two walls, rising pierced with windows on either hand, were flaming with light, since the property room and the firemen's office were situated on the ground floor, with the managerial bureau on the left, and on the right and upstairs the dressing rooms of the company. The mouths of furnaces seemed to be opening on the outer darkness from top to bottom of this well. The count had at once marked the light in the windows of the dressing room on the first floor, and as a man who is comforted and happy, he forgot where he was and stood gazing upward amid the foul mud and faint decaying smell peculiar to the premises of this antiquated Parisian building. Big drops were dripping from a broken waterspout, and a ray of gaslight slipped from Mme Bron's window and cast a yellow glare over a patch of moss-clad pavement, over the base of a wall which had been rotted by water from a sink, over a whole cornerful of nameless filth amid which old pails and broken crocks lay in fine confusion round a spindling tree growing mildewed in its pot. A window fastening creaked, and the count fled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1310" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>十点钟敲响了。缪法忽然想到，要知道娜娜在不在她的化妆室里，是件很容易的事。他越过三级台阶，穿越粉刷成黄色的小前厅，而后从一道只上了插销的门那儿潜入院子里。这时候，狭窄的院子很潮湿，乍看上去像一口井的井底，周围是臭气熏人的厕所，水龙头，厨房的炉灶，还有女门房胡乱堆放在那里的草木。这一切统统笼罩在黑色烟雾之中；然而，开在两堵墙上的各扇窗户里面却灯火辉煌。楼下是存放道具的仓库和消防处，左边是办公室；右边和楼上是演员化妆室。那一扇扇窗户酷似井壁上的朝向黑暗中的一张张张开的炉口。伯爵马上看见了二楼上娜娜的化妆室里亮着灯火；于是，他如释重负，喜出望外，两眼仰望天空，这座巴黎的百年老屋后面的污泥，飘散着臭味的空气，他都忘记了。大滴大滴的水珠从水管的裂缝中滴下来。一道煤气灯的灯光从布龙太太的窗子里射进来，把一段长了苔藓的路面、一段被厨房的排水沟的污水侵蚀了的墙根及整个堆满了垃圾的角落映成了黄色，垃圾中有旧水桶和破坛碎罐，一口破锅内竟然长出了一棵瘦小的卫矛。 伯爵听见开插销的声音，连忙退了出来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1311');"><p>Nana was certainly going to come down. He returned to his post in front of the reading room; among its slumbering shadows, which seemed only broken by the glimmer of a night light, the little old man still sat motionless, his side face sharply outlined against his newspaper. Then Muffat walked again and this time took a more prolonged turn and, crossing the large gallery, followed the Galerie des Varietes as far as that of Feydeau. The last mentioned was cold and deserted and buried in melancholy shadow. He returned from it, passed by the theater, turned the corner of the Galerie Saint-Marc and ventured as far as the Galerie Montmartre, where a sugar-chopping machine in front of a grocer's interested him awhile. But when he was taking his third turn he was seized with such dread lest Nana should escape behind his back that he lost all self-respect. Thereupon he stationed himself beside the fair gentleman in front of the very theater. Both exchanged a glance of fraternal humility with which was mingled a touch of distrust, for it was possible they might yet turn out to be rivals. Some sceneshifters who came out smoking their pipes between the acts brushed rudely against them, but neither one nor the other ventured to complain. Three big wenches with untidy hair and dirty gowns appeared on the doorstep. They were munching apples and spitting out the cores, but the two men bowed their heads and patiently braved their impudent looks and rough speeches, though they were hustled and, as it were, soiled by these trollops, who amused themselves by pushing each other down upon them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1311" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜肯定就要下楼了。他又回到阅览室前面；在一盏夜明灯的昏暗灯光下，老头子一动也没有动，他的侧影的一部分映在报纸上。接着，他又踱步了。现在，他往远处走走，他越过大走廊，沿着游艺剧院的走廊一直走到费多走廊，这条走廊上很冷，阒无一人，隐没在凄凄黑暗之中；然后他往回走，经过剧院门口，绕过圣马克走廊，壮着胆量一直走到蒙马特走廊那里，那儿有一家杂货店，里面的切糖机把他吸引住了。但是，他转到第三个来回时，他突然担心娜娜从他的背后溜走，这使他抛弃了一切人类尊严。他便和那位金发先生木立在剧院门口，两个人交换了一下友好、忍辱的目光，目光里还流露出一点不信任的神色，因为他们都怀疑对方可能是自己的情敌。幕间休息时，一些置景工出来抽烟斗，把他俩撞了一下，谁也不敢吱声，三个披头散发、身着脏裙子的高个子姑娘来到门口，啃着苹果，把果核随地乱吐；他们耷拉着脑袋，忍受着她们放肆无礼的目光和粗俗不堪的话语的侮辱，他们被这些臭娘儿们溅污、弄脏了衣服，她们故意挤到他们身上，推推搡搡，还觉得这样做挺有趣呢。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1312');"><p>At that very moment Nana descended the three steps. She grew very pale when she noticed Muffat.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1314');"><p>The sniggering extra ladies were quite frightened when they recognized her, and they formed in line and stood up, looking as stiff and serious as servants whom their mistress has caught behaving badly. The tall fair gentleman had moved away; he was at once reassured and sad at heart.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1314" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>正在冷笑的几个女群众演员认出是娜娜，顿时害怕起来，便站成一行，表情呆板而严肃，像一群正在做坏事的女仆被女主人撞见似的。那个高个子金发先生站到一旁，这时他才放了心，但心里仍怀几分忧虑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1315');"><p>"Well, give me your arm," Nana continued impatiently.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1315" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好吧，挽住我的胳膊吧。”娜娜不耐烦地说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1316');"><p>They walked quietly off. The count had been getting ready to question her and now found nothing to say.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1317');"><p>It was she who in rapid tones told a story to the effect that she had been at her aunt's as late as eight o'clock, when, seeing Louiset very much better, she had conceived the idea of going down to the theater for a few minutes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1317" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>倒是娜娜滔滔不绝地编造了一段话：八点钟时，她还在她姑妈家里，后来她看小路易的病好多了，于是，她就想到剧院里来看看。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1318');"><p>"On some important business?" he queried.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1318" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你到剧院有什么重要事情？”他问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1319');"><p>"Yes, a new piece," she replied after some slight hesitation. "They wanted my advice."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1319" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有重要事情，剧院要演一出新戏，”她迟疑了一会儿，回答道，“大家想听听我的意见。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1320');"><p>He knew that she was not speaking the truth, but the warm touch of her arm as it leaned firmly on his own, left him powerless. He felt neither anger nor rancor after his long, long wait; his one thought was to keep her where she was now that he had got hold of her. Tomorrow, and not before, he would try and find out what she had come to her dressing room after. But Nana still appeared to hesitate; she was manifestly a prey to the sort of secret anguish that besets people when they are trying to regain lost ground and to initiate a plan of action. Accordingly, as they turned the corner of the Galerie des Varietes, she stopped in front of the show in a fan seller's window.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1320" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他心里明白她在撒谎。但是她的胳膊紧紧地挽住他的胳膊，一种温暖的感觉使他浑身酥软了。他长时间等候她，心里积了一股怒火和怨气，这时都消失了，现在他已把她抓在手里，他心里唯一的想法是把她留在自己身边。第二天，他将尽力去了解一下她为什么到化妆室来。娜娜一直在迟疑不决，明显看出她的内心很痛苦，她在进行剧烈的思想斗争，她竭力使自己平静下来，并打定主意，她在游艺剧院走廊的拐弯处停下来，站在一家扇子店的橱窗前。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1321');"><p>"I say, that's pretty," she whispered; "I mean that mother-of-pearl mount with the feathers."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1322');"><p>Then, indifferently:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1325');"><p>She was sorry she had told him that story. Perhaps Louiset was passing through another crisis! She talked of returning to the Batignolles. But when he offered to accompany her she did not insist on going. For a second or two she was possessed with the kind of white-hot fury which a woman experiences when she feels herself entrapped and must, nevertheless, behave prettily. But in the end she grew resigned and determined to gain time. If only she could get rid of the count toward midnight everything would happen as she wished.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1325" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她现在后悔不该撒谎。也许小路易的病又发作了；她说她要回巴蒂尼奥勒看看。但是，因为他自愿同她一道去，她就不再坚持去了。有一阵子，她的脸都气白了，因为她觉得自己被他缠住了，还要表现出一副温顺的样子。忍到最后，决心争取时间尽快摆脱他，只要在午夜之前摆脱伯爵，一切就会按照她的意愿安排。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1326');"><p>"Yes, it's true; you're a bachelor tonight," she murmured. "Your wife doesn't return till tomorrow, eh?"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1327');"><p>"Yes," replied Muffat. It embarrassed him somewhat to hear her talking familiarly about the countess.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1327" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对。”缪法回答，他听见娜娜随便谈到伯爵夫人，心里有点不自在。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1328');"><p>But she pressed him further, asking at what time the train was due and wanting to know whether he were going to the station to meet her. She had begun to walk more slowly than ever, as though the shops interested her very much.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1328" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但是娜娜又追问下去，问火车几点钟到达，她还想知道他是否到车站去接她。她又放慢了脚步，好像被这里的店铺吸引住了。

The tinsel of the ARTICLE DE PARIS, the false jewelry, the gilded zinc, the cardboard made to look like leather, had been the passion of her early youth. It remained, and when she passed the shop-windows she could not tear herself away from them. It was the same with her today as when she was a ragged, slouching child who fell into reveries in front of the chocolate maker's sweet-stuff shows or stood listening to a musical box in a neighboring shop or fell into supreme ecstasies over cheap, vulgarly designed knickknacks, such as nutshell workboxes, ragpickers' baskets for holding toothpicks, Vendome columns and Luxor obelisks on which thermometers were mounted. But that evening she was too much agitated and looked at things without seeing them. When all was said and done, it bored her to think she was not free. An obscure revolt raged within her, and amid it all she felt a wild desire to do something foolish. It was a great thing gained, forsooth, to be mistress of men of position! She had been devouring the prince's substance and Steiner's, too, with her childish caprices, and yet she had no notion where her money went. Even at this time of day her flat in the Boulevard Haussmann was not entirely furnished. The drawing room alone was finished, and with its red satin upholsteries and excess of ornamentation and furniture it struck a decidedly false note. Her creditors, moreover, would now take to tormenting her more than ever before whenever she had no money on hand, a fact which caused her constant surprise, seeing that she was wont to quote her self as a model of economy. For a month past that thief Steiner had been scarcely able to pay up his thousand francs on the occasions when she threatened to kick him out of doors in case he failed to bring them. As to Muffat, he was an idiot: he had no notion as to what it was usual to give, and she could not, therefore, grow angry with him on the score of miserliness. Oh, how gladly she would have turned all these folks off had she not repeated to herself a score of times daily a whole string of economical maxims!

It had now become an almost religious memory with her, and through dint of being ceaselessly recalled it grew even more grandiose. And for these reasons, though trembling with repressed indignation, she now hung submissively on the count's arm as they went from window to window among the fast-diminishing crowd. The pavement was drying outside, and a cool wind blew along the gallery, swept the close hot air up beneath the glass that imprisoned it and shook the colored lanterns and the lines of gas jets and the giant fan which was flaring away like a set piece in an illumination. At the door of the restaurant a waiter was putting out the gas, while the motionless attendants in the empty, glaring shops looked as though they had dropped off to sleep with their eyes open.

It was very pleasant out she said; besides, they were in no hurry, and it would be charming to return home on foot. When they were in front of the Cafe Anglais she had a sudden longing to eat oysters. Indeed, she said that owing to Louiset's illness she had tasted nothing since morning. Muffat dared not oppose her. Yet as he did not in those days wish to be seen about with her he asked for a private supper room and hurried to it along the corridors. She followed him with the air of a woman familiar with the house, and they were on the point of entering a private room, the door of which a waiter held open, when from a neighboring saloon, whence issued a perfect tempest of shouts and laughter, a man rapidly emerged. It was Daguenet.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1333" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们终于离开了胡同，娜娜不想坐马车。她说天气很好，而且也没有什么急事，这样步行回家倒挺惬意的。随后，他们到达英格兰咖啡馆前，她想吃点东西，她说她想吃牡蛎，说因为小路易生病，她从早上到现在没有吃一点东西，缪法不敢违抗她的意愿。到目前为止，他还没有在公开场所与她在一起，于是他要了一个单间，匆匆忙忙沿着走廊向里面走去。娜娜跟在他后面，看样子对这家咖啡馆很熟悉。单间的侍者拉着门，他们正要进去时，隔壁客厅里响起一阵震耳欲聋的笑声和叫喊声，一个男人突然走出来，他是达盖内。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1337');"><p>Nana smiled and laid a finger on her lips to beg him to be silent.

</p></origin><translate id="div_1337" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜嫣然一笑，把一个手指放在嘴唇上，示意他住嘴。她觉得他话太多，不过，在那里碰见他，她还是挺高兴的。尽管他行径卑劣，与一些正派女人在一起时，装着不认识她，但在她的心目中，对他仍然怀有一点柔情。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1338');"><p>"What are you doing now?" she asked amicably.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1340');"><p>She shrugged her shoulders with a pitying air. But he jokingly continued to the effect that to be only just gaining enough on 'change to buy ladies bouquets could scarcely be called an income, provided you wanted to look respectable too! His three hundred thousand francs had only lasted him eighteen months! He wanted to be practical, and he was going to marry a girl with a huge dowry and end off as a PREFET, like his father before him! Nana still smiled incredulously. She nodded in the direction of the saloon: "Who are you with in there?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1340" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她用同情的神态耸耸肩膀。但是他用开玩笑的口气继续说，他在交易所赚的钱，只够给女人买点鲜花，这样保持一个正派单身汉的名声，这简直不是一种生活。他的三十万法郎只维持了十八个月。他想还是要实际一点，像他父亲一样，娶一个带来一大笔嫁妆的妻子，最后当省长结束一生。娜娜总是笑咪咪的，一点不相信他的话，她用头指指他的房间，问道： “你和谁在那里面？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1341');"><p>"Oh, a whole gang," he said, forgetting all about his projects under the influence of returning intoxication. "Just think! Lea is telling us about her trip in Egypt. Oh, it's screaming! There's a bathing story—"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1342');"><p>And he told the story while Nana lingered complaisantly. They had ended by leaning up against the wall in the corridor, facing one another. Gas jets were flaring under the low ceiling, and a vague smell of cookery hung about the folds of the hangings. Now and again, in order to hear each other's voices when the din in the saloon became louder than ever, they had to lean well forward. Every few seconds, however, a waiter with an armful of dishes found his passage barred and disturbed them. But they did not cease their talk for that; on the contrary, they stood close up to the walls and, amid the uproar of the supper party and the jostlings of the waiters, chatted as quietly as if they were by their own firesides.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1342" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，他把这个故事转述了一遍。娜娜呆在那儿，听得很高兴。最后他们倚在长廊上，面对面地交谈了。煤气灯在低矮的天花板下燃着，墙饰的皱褶里滞留着隐隐约约的菜肴气味。餐室里的嘈杂声不时变大，他们不得不把脸凑近一些，以便彼此听得清楚一些。每隔二十秒钟，就有一个侍者端着盘子走过，看见走廊堵住了，就请他们让一下。但是，他们并未因此而中断谈话，只是朝安静的墙边贴紧一点，他们不顾吃夜宵者的吵吵嚷嚷和侍者的挤挤撞撞，像在家里一样谈话。

</p></origin><translate id="div_1344" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两个人看了那扇门一眼。门在微微颤抖着，似乎被一股风吹动着。最后，门慢慢地关上了，没有发出一点声音。两个人不出声地相互笑了笑。伯爵一个人呆在里面，那副样子大概是挺好看的。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1359');"><p>"I suspected it," she said at last, slapping her leg. "I guessed it by merely looking at her on the highroad that day.

</p></origin><translate id="div_1359" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我早料到了！”她终于开口了，一边拍着大腿，“有一次，我在路上遇见她，一看她那副样子，我就猜到了。竟然有这样的事情，一个正经女人欺骗丈夫，同福什利这样的色鬼睡觉！ 这回他肯定要把自己的经验教给她。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1360');"><p>"Oh, it isn't her trial trip," muttered Daguenet wickedly. "Perhaps she knows as much about it as he does."

</p></origin><translate id="div_1364" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>达盖内把她拉到自己身边，把她的手拉住一会儿。接着，他用清脆的嗓音对他讲话，那嗓音犹如口琴吹奏的声音，他把女人搞到手全靠这样的嗓音：

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1370');"><p>When at length she went into the private room she noticed that Muffat was sitting resignedly on a narrow divan with pale face and twitching hands. He did not reproach her at all, and she, greatly moved, was divided between feelings of pity and of contempt. The poor man! To think of his being so unworthily cheated by a vile wife! She had a good mind to throw her arms round his neck and comfort him. But it was only fair all the same! He was a fool with women, and this would teach him a lesson! Nevertheless, pity overcame her. She did not get rid of him as she had determined to do after the oysters had been discussed. They scarcely stayed a quarter of an hour in the Cafe Anglais, and together they went into the house in the Boulevard Haussmann. It was then eleven. Before midnight she would have easily have discovered some means of getting rid of him kindly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1370" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她终于走进单间，看见缪法坐在一张狭窄的沙发上，一副听天由命的样子，脸色苍白，两手颤抖。他丝毫没有责备她。娜娜心里很激动，她觉得他既可怜又可恶，这个可怜的男人，竟受到一个下流老婆如此卑鄙的欺骗！她真想扑上去搂住他的脖子安慰他。但是，这对他来说，仍然是公平的，因为他在女人面前总是傻乎乎的；这件事也该给他一个教训吧。然而，在她心目中，对他的怜悯还是主要的。吃过牡蛎后，她并未像她原来计划的那样放他走，而是把他留下来。他们在英格兰咖啡馆逗留了一刻钟，而后两人一起回到了奥斯曼大街。这时已是十一点钟了，在午夜前，她可以想出一个婉转的方法把他打发走。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1371');"><p>In the anteroom, however, she took the precaution of giving Zoe an order. "You'll look out for him, and you'll tell him not to make a noise if the other man's still with me."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1374');"><p>In the room inside Muffat was already taking off his overcoat. A big fire was burning on the hearth. It was the same room as of old, with its rosewood furniture and its hangings and chair coverings of figured damask with the large blue flowers on a gray background. On two occasions Nana had thought of having it redone, the first in black velvet, the second in white satin with bows, but directly Steiner consented she demanded the money that these changes would cost simply with a view to pillaging him. She had, indeed, only indulged in a tiger skin rug for the hearth and a cut-glass hanging lamp.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1374" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>缪法进卧室后就脱掉了礼服。壁炉里燃着旺火。这间卧室还是原来的样子，家具全是红木的，壁毯和椅套都是灰底大蓝花的织绵。娜娜曾经两次想把房间重新布置一下，第一次想把它们都换成黑丝绒，第二次想换成带粉红色结子的白缎子。每当斯泰内答应后，她就按照所需费用向他要钱，但是钱一到手，她就把钱花光。她只有一次心血来潮时，买了一张虎皮铺在壁炉前，又买了一盏水晶吊灯挂在天花板上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1375');"><p>"I'm not sleepy; I'm not going to bed," she said the moment they were shut in together.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1378');"><p>Nevertheless, he took his boots off, too, before seating himself in front of the fire. One of Nana's pleasures consisted in undressing herself in front of the mirror on her wardrobe door, which reflected her whole height. She would let everything slip off her in turn and then would stand perfectly naked and gaze and gaze in complete oblivion of all around her. Passion for her own body, ecstasy over her satin skin and the supple contours of her shape, would keep her serious, attentive and absorbed in the love of herself. The hairdresser frequently found her standing thus and would enter without her once turning to look at him. Muffat used to grow angry then, but he only succeeded in astonishing her. What was coming over the man? She was doing it to please herself, not other people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1378" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而，他在火炉前坐下来之前，替她脱掉了她的高帮皮鞋。娜娜有一种乐趣，就是对着衣橱上的镜子脱衣服，然后站在镜子前自我欣赏一番。她连衬衫也脱掉，然后，全身一丝不挂，久久地看着自己，忘记了一切。她很迷恋自己的肉体，对她软缎般的肌肤和线条柔软的腰身自我陶醉，这使她庄重严肃，全神贯注，沉浸在一种自爱之中。她经常这样被理发师撞见，但是她连头也不掉。缪法见到这种情况就生气，而她对他生气感到奇怪，缪法怎么啦？她这个样子不是让别人看的，而是让自己看的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1379');"><p>That particular evening she wanted to have a better view of herself, and she lit the six candles attached to the frame of the mirror.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1380');"><p>"You haven't read the Figaro article, have you? The paper's on the table." Daguenet's laugh had recurred to her recollections, and she was harassed by a doubt. If that Fauchery had slandered her she would be revenged.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1380" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你没有读《费加罗报》上的那篇文章吗？……报纸在桌子上。” 她回忆起达盖内的冷笑，一个疑团缠绕着她。如果这个福什利诽谤她，她要对他进行报复。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1381');"><p>"They say that it's about me," she continued, affecting indifference. "What's your notion, eh, darling?"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1382');"><p>And letting go her shift and waiting till Muffat should have done reading, she stood naked. Muffat was reading slowly Fauchery's article entitled "The Golden Fly," describing the life of a harlot descended from four or five generations of drunkards and tainted in her blood by a cumulative inheritance of misery and drink, which in her case has taken the form of a nervous exaggeration of the sexual instinct. She has shot up to womanhood in the slums and on the pavements of Paris, and tall, handsome and as superbly grown as a dunghill plant, she avenges the beggars and outcasts of whom she is the ultimate product. With her the rottenness that is allowed to ferment among the populace is carried upward and rots the aristocracy. She becomes a blind power of nature, a leaven of destruction, and unwittingly she corrupts and disorganizes all Paris, churning it between her snow-white thighs as milk is monthly churned by housewives. And it was at the end of this article that the comparison with a fly occurred, a fly of sunny hue which has flown up out of the dung, a fly which sucks in death on the carrion tolerated by the roadside and then buzzing, dancing and glittering like a precious stone enters the windows of palaces and poisons the men within by merely settling on them in her flight.

A cold, shivering feeling was creeping from his scalp to his shoulders. This article had been written anyhow. The phrases were wildly extravagant; the unexpected epigrams and quaint collocations of words went beyond all bounds. Yet notwithstanding this, he was struck by what he had read, for it had rudely awakened within him much that for months past he had not cared to think about.

She was bending her neck and was looking attentively in the mirror at a little brown mark above her right haunch. She was touching it with the tip of her finger and by dint of bending backward was making it stand out more clearly than ever. Situated where it was, it doubtless struck her as both quaint and pretty. After that she studied other parts of her body with an amused expression and much of the vicious curiosity of a child. The sight of herself always astonished her, and she would look as surprised and ecstatic as a young girl who has discovered her puberty. Slowly, slowly, she spread out her arms in order to give full value to her figure, which suggested the torso of a plump Venus. She bent herself this way and that and examined herself before and behind, stooping to look at the side view of her bosom and at the sweeping contours of her thighs. And she ended with a strange amusement which consisted of swinging to right and left, her knees apart and her body swaying from the waist with the perpetual jogging, twitching movements peculiar to an oriental dancer in the danse du ventre.

For a moment he saw her as she was, and he despised himself. Yes, it was just that; she had corrupted his life; he already felt himself tainted to his very marrow by impurities hitherto undreamed of. Everything was now destined to rot within him, and in the twinkling of an eye he understood what this evil entailed. He saw the ruin brought about by this kind of "leaven"—himself poisoned, his family destroyed, a bit of the social fabric cracking and crumbling. And unable to take his eyes from the sight, he sat looking fixedly at her, striving to inspire himself with loathing for her nakedness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1387" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>缪法全神贯注地看着她。她令他恐惧。报纸从他的手中落下来，这时他恍然大悟了，于是他蔑视自己了，确实是这样，在三个月时间里，娜娜腐蚀了他的生活，他感到自己被脏东西腐蚀到了骨髓，而这些东西他简直不曾怀疑过。现在，他身上的一切都快要腐烂。他顿时意识到这种邪恶所产生的危害，他看到了这种酵素所引起的解体作用，它毒害了他，他的家庭被破坏了，社会的一个角落发出哗啦一声响，接着崩塌下来。他无法把视线从娜娜身上移开，他一直盯着她看，竭力想让自己对她的裸体痛恨起来。

With an arm behind her neck, one hand clasped in the other, and her elbows far apart, she was throwing back her head so that he could see a foreshortened reflection of her half-closed eyes, her parted lips, her face clothed with amorous laughter. Her masses of yellow hair were unknotted behind, and they covered her back with the fell of a lioness.

A delicate line, to which the shoulder and the thigh added their slight undulations, ran from one of her elbows to her foot, and Muffat's eyes followed this tender profile and marked how the outlines of the fair flesh vanished in golden gleams and how its rounded contours shone like silk in the candlelight. He thought of his old dread of Woman, of the Beast of the Scriptures, at once lewd and wild. Nana was all covered with fine hair; a russet made her body velvety, while the Beast was apparent in the almost equine development of her flanks, in the fleshy exuberances and deep hollows of her body, which lent her sex the mystery and suggestiveness lurking in their shadows. She was, indeed, that Golden Creature, blind as brute force, whose very odor ruined the world. Muffat gazed and gazed as a man possessed, till at last, when he had shut his eyes in order to escape it, the Brute reappeared in the darkness of the brain, larger, more terrible, more suggestive in its attitude. Now, he understood, it would remain before his eyes, in his very flesh, forever.

Her eyes were moist; she tried, as it were, to make herself small, as though she could feel herself better thus. Then she threw her head and bosom back and, melting, as it were, in one great bodily caress, she rubbed her cheeks coaxingly, first against one shoulder, then against the other. Her lustful mouth breathed desire over her limbs. She put out her lips, kissed herself long in the neighborhood of her armpit and laughed at the other Nana who also was kissing herself in the mirror.

And with that she relapsed into a long silence and reflected on how to dismiss the count. She would have liked to do it in an agreeable way, for she was still a good-natured wench, and it bored her to cause others pain, especially in the present instance where the man was a cuckold.

When he looked mechanically up into the sky he saw ragged, soot-colored clouds scudding in front of the moon. At this hour of the night passers-by were becoming few and far between in the Boulevard Haussmann. He skirted the enclosures round the opera house in his search for darkness, and as he went along he kept mumbling inconsequent phrases. That girl had been lying. She had invented her story out of sheer stupidity and cruelty. He ought to have crushed her head when he had it under his heel. After all was said and done, the business was too shameful. Never would he see her; never would he touch her again, or if he did he would be miserably weak. And with that he breathed hard, as though he were free once more. Oh, that naked, cruel monster, roasting away like any goose and slavering over everything that he had respected for forty years back. The moon had come out, and the empty street was bathed in white light. He felt afraid, and he burst into a great fit of sobbing, for he had grown suddenly hopeless and maddened as though he had sunk into a fathomless void.

He tried hard to be calm, and as the story told him by that courtesan kept recurring to his burning consciousness, he wanted to reason the matter out. The countess was coming up from Mme de Chezelles's country house tomorrow morning. Yet nothing, in fact, could have prevented her from returning to Paris the night before and passing it with that man. He now began recalling to mind certain details of their stay at Les Fondettes. One evening, for instance, he had surprised Sabine in the shade of some trees, when she was so much agitated as to be unable to answer his questions. The man had been present; why should she not be with him now? The more he thought about it the more possible the whole story became, and he ended by thinking it natural and even inevitable. While he was in his shirt sleeves in the house of a harlot his wife was undressing in her lover's room. Nothing could be simpler or more logical! Reasoning in this way, he forced himself to keep cool. He felt as if there were a great downward movement in the direction of fleshly madness, a movement which, as it grew, was overcoming the whole world round about him. Warm images pursued him in imagination. A naked Nana suddenly evoked a naked Sabine. At this vision, which seemed to bring them together in shameless relationship and under the influence of the same lusts, he literally stumbled, and in the road a cab nearly ran over him. Some women who had come out of a cafe jostled him amid loud laughter. Then a fit of weeping once more overcame him, despite all his efforts to the contrary, and, not wishing to shed tears in the presence of others, he plunged into a dark and empty street. It was the Rue Rossini, and along its silent length he wept like a child.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1459" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他走过一条条林荫大道，晚归的行人大步流星地走着。他竭力让自己平静下来。那个婊子胡诌的事又开始浮现在他的热乎乎的头脑中，他真想逐一分析一下事情真实性的程度。要到明天早上伯爵夫人才从德谢泽勒夫人的古堡里回来。事实上，她完全可能在昨天晚上就回到巴黎，在那个男人家过夜。他现在回顾起在丰岱特庄园居住时的某些细节。比如说那一天晚上，他在树下突然撞见萨比娜，她慌乱得连话都说不出来。那个男人当时也在那里。那么，难道现在她就不能在他家里吗？他越想越觉得娜娜说的事是很可能的。最后，他觉得这事是自然的，而且是必然会发生的。当他自己在一个婊子家里脱掉外衣时，他的老婆在一个情人的卧室里脱衣解带，这是最简单的、最合乎逻辑的事。他这样一边推理，一边竭力让自己冷静下来。他感觉到陷入疯狂的肉欲之中，这种感觉在他身上不断扩大，并蔓延到他周围，征服了他周围的人。这一幕幕情景接二连三地出现在他发热的头脑中。他脑海里浮现出赤身裸体的娜娜，突然间他又联想到赤身裸体的萨比娜。在这幻想之中，他把这两个女人相提并论，他们同样寡廉鲜耻，同样受淫欲的驱使，想着想着，他不禁打了一个踉跄，差点被行车道上驶来的一辆出租马车撞倒。从一家咖啡馆里出来的一些女人，嘻嘻哈哈用胳膊肘对他推推搡搡。这时，他忍不住内心的悲痛，流下了眼泪。他不愿在人面前呜呜咽咽，便钻进黑魆魆的阒无一人的罗西尼街中，沿着寂静的房子，一边走一边哭得像个孩子。

He felt a shame and a fear which made him fly before people's faces with the restless step of a bird of darkness. When passers-by met him on the pavement he did his best to look and walk in a leisurely way, for he fancied they were reading his secret in the very swing of his shoulders. He had followed the Rue de la Grange Bateliere as far as the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre, where the brilliant lamplight surprised him, and he retraced his steps. For nearly an hour he traversed the district thus, choosing always the darkest corners. Doubtless there was some goal whither his steps were patiently, instinctively, leading him through a labyrinth of endless turnings. At length he lifted his eyes up it a street corner. He had reached his destination, the point where the Rue Taitbout and the Rue de la Provence met. He had taken an hour amid his painful mental sufferings to arrive at a place he could have reached in five minutes. One morning a month ago he remembered going up to Fauchery's rooms to thank him for a notice of a ball at the Tuileries, in which the journalist had mentioned him. The flat was between the ground floor and the first story and had a row of small square windows which were half hidden by the colossal signboard belonging to a shop. The last window on the left was bisected by a brilliant band of lamplight coming from between the half-closed curtains. And he remained absorbed and expectant, with his gaze fixed on this shining streak.

The Rue de Provence and the Rue Taitbout lay in shadow, bestarred at intervals by bright splashes of light from the gas lamps, which in the distance were merged in yellow mist. Muffat did not move from where he was standing. That was the room. He remembered it now: it had hangings of red "andrinople," and a Louis XIII bed stood at one end of it. The lamp must be standing on the chimney piece to the right. Without doubt they had gone to bed, for no shadows passed across the window, and the bright streak gleamed as motionless as the light of a night lamp. With his eyes still uplifted he began forming a plan; he would ring the bell, go upstairs despite the porter's remonstrances, break the doors in with a push of his shoulder and fall upon them in the very bed without giving them time to unlace their arms. For one moment the thought that he had no weapon upon him gave him pause, but directly afterward he decided to throttle them. He returned to the consideration of his project, and he perfected it while waiting for some sign, some indication, which should bring certainty with it.

When these were lost to view in the Rue de Provence he returned to his post, wet and shivering. The luminous streak still traversed the window, and this time he was going away for good when a shadow crossed it. It moved so quickly that he thought he had deceived himself. But first one and then another black thing followed quickly after it, and there was a regular commotion in the room. Riveted anew to the pavement, he experienced an intolerable burning sensation in his inside as he waited to find out the meaning of it all. Outlines of arms and legs flitted after one another, and an enormous hand traveled about with the silhouette of a water jug. He distinguished nothing clearly, but he thought he recognized a woman's headdress. And he disputed the point with himself; it might well have been Sabine's hair, only the neck did not seem sufficiently slim. At that hour of the night he had lost the power of recognition and of action. In this terrible agony of uncertainty his inside caused him such acute suffering that he pressed against the door in order to calm himself, shivering like a man in rags, as he did so. Then seeing that despite everything he could not turn his eyes away from the window, his anger changed into a fit of moralizing. He fancied himself a deputy; he was haranguing an assembly, loudly denouncing debauchery, prophesying national ruin. And he reconstructed Fauchery's article on the poisoned fly, and he came before the house and declared that morals such as these, which could only be paralleled in the days of the later Roman Empire, rendered society an impossibility; that did him good. But the shadows had meanwhile disappeared. Doubtless they had gone to bed again, and, still watching, he continued waiting where he was.

When showers fell he buried himself in a corner of the doorway, his legs splashed with wet. Nobody passed by now, and occasionally his eyes would close, as though scorched by the streak of light, which he kept watching obstinately, fixedly, with idiotic persistence. On two subsequent occasions the shadows flitted about, repeating the same gestures and agitating the silhouette of the same gigantic jug, and twice quiet was re-established, and the night lamp again glowed discreetly out. These shadows only increased his uncertainty. Then, too, a sudden idea soothed his brain while it postponed the decisive moment. After all, he had only to wait for the woman when she left the house. He could quite easily recognize Sabine. Nothing could be simpler, and there would be no scandal, and he would be sure of things one way or the other. It was only necessary to stay where he was. Among all the confused feelings which had been agitating him he now merely felt a dull need of certain knowledge. But sheer weariness and vacancy began lulling him to sleep under his doorway, and by way of distraction he tried to reckon up how long he would have to wait. Sabine was to be at the station toward nine o'clock; that meant about four hours and a half more. He was very patient; he would even have been content not to move again, and he found a certain charm in fancying that his night vigil would last through eternity.

This extremely simple event was to him an unforeseen catastrophe, at once troublesome and disagreeable. Evidently they had just put the lamp out and were going to sleep. It was reasonable enough at that hour, but he was irritated thereat, for now the darkened window ceased to interest him. He watched it for a quarter of an hour longer and then grew tired and, leaving the doorway, took a turn upon the pavement. Until five o'clock he walked to and fro, looking upward from time to time. The window seemed a dead thing, and now and then he asked himself if he had not dreamed that shadows had been dancing up there behind the panes. An intolerable sense of fatigue weighed him down, a dull, heavy feeling, under the influence of which he forgot what he was waiting for at that particular street corner. He kept stumbling on the pavement and starting into wakefulness with the icy shudder of a man who does not know where he is. Nothing seemed to justify the painful anxiety he was inflicting on himself. Since those people were asleep—well then, let them sleep! What good could it do mixing in their affairs? It was very dark; no one would ever know anything about this night's doings. And with that every sentiment within him, down to curiosity itself, took flight before the longing to have done with it all and to find relief somewhere. The cold was increasing, and the street was becoming insufferable. Twice he walked away and slowly returned, dragging one foot behind the other, only to walk farther away next time. It was all over; nothing was left him now, and so he went down the whole length of the boulevard and did not return.

As he neared each successive gaslight it grew taller and immediately afterward diminished. But this lulled him and occupied him mechanically. He never knew afterward where he had been; it seemed as if he had dragged himself round and round in a circle for hours. One reminiscence only was very distinctly retained by him. Without his being able to explain how it came about he found himself with his face pressed close against the gate at the end of the Passage des Panoramas and his two hands grasping the bars. He did not shake them but, his whole heart swelling with emotion, he simply tried to look into the passage. But he could make nothing out clearly, for shadows flooded the whole length of the deserted gallery, and the wind, blowing hard down the Rue Saint-Marc, puffed in his face with the damp breath of a cellar. For a time he tried doggedly to see into the place, and then, awakening from his dream, he was filled with astonishment and asked himself what he could possibly be seeking for at that hour and in that position, for he had pressed against the railings so fiercely that they had left their mark on his face. Then he went on tramp once more. He was hopeless, and his heart was full of infinite sorrow, for he felt, amid all those shadows, that he was evermore betrayed and alone.

Muffat had returned into the wide streets, which were then in course of construction on either side of the new opera house. Soaked by the rain and cut up by cart wheels, the chalky soil had become a lake of liquid mire. But he never looked to see where he was stepping and walked on and on, slipping and regaining his footing as he went. The awakening of Paris, with its gangs of sweepers and early workmen trooping to their destinations, added to his troubles as day brightened. People stared at him in surprise as he went by with scared look and soaked hat and muddy clothes. For a long while he sought refuge against palings and among scaffoldings, his desolate brain haunted by the single remaining thought that he was very miserable.

The sudden idea of divine help, of superhuman consolation, surprised him, as though it were something unforeseen and extraordinary. The image of M. Venot was evoked thereby, and he saw his little plump face and ruined teeth. Assuredly M. Venot, whom for months he had been avoiding and thereby rendering miserable, would be delighted were he to go and knock at his door and fall weeping into his arms. In the old days God had been always so merciful toward him. At the least sorrow, the slightest obstacle on the path of life, he had been wont to enter a church, where, kneeling down, he would humble his littleness in the presence of Omnipotence. And he had been used to go forth thence, fortified by prayer, fully prepared to give up the good things of this world, possessed by the single yearning for eternal salvation. But at present he only practiced by fits and starts, when the terror of hell came upon him. All kinds of weak inclinations had overcome him, and the thought of Nana disturbed his devotions. And now the thought of God astonished him. Why had he not thought of God before, in the hour of that terrible agony when his feeble humanity was breaking up in ruin?

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1471');"><p>Meanwhile with slow and painful steps he sought for a church. But he had lost his bearings; the early hour had changed the face of the streets. Soon, however, as he turned the corner of the Rue de la Chaussee-d'Antin, he noticed a tower looming vaguely in the fog at the end of the Trinite Church. The white statues overlooking the bare garden seemed like so many chilly Venuses among the yellow foliage of a park. Under the porch he stood and panted a little, for the ascent of the wide steps had tired him. Then he went in. The church was very cold, for its heating apparatus had been fireless since the previous evening, and its lofty, vaulted aisles were full of a fine damp vapor which had come filtering through the windows. The aisles were deep in shadow; not a soul was in the church, and the only sound audible amid the unlovely darkness was that made by the old shoes of some verger or other who was dragging himself about in sulky semiwakefulness. Muffat, however, after knocking forlornly against an untidy collection of chairs, sank on his knees with bursting heart and propped himself against the rails in front of a little chapel close by a font. He clasped his hands and began searching within himself for suitable prayers, while his whole being yearned toward a transport. But only his lips kept stammering empty words; his heart and brain were far away, and with them he returned to the outer world and began his long, unresting march through the streets, as though lashed forward by implacable necessity. And he kept repeating, "O my God, come to my assistance! O my God, abandon not Thy creature, who delivers himself up to Thy justice! O my God, I adore Thee: Thou wilt not leave me to perish under the buffetings of mine enemies!" Nothing answered: the shadows and the cold weighed upon him, and the noise of the old shoes continued in the distance and prevented him praying. Nothing, indeed, save that tiresome noise was audible in the deserted church, where the matutinal sweeping was unknown before the early masses had somewhat warmed the air of the place. After that he rose to his feet with the help of a chair, his knees cracking under him as he did so. God was not yet there. And why should he weep in M. Venot's arms? The man could do nothing.

Outside he slipped, and he felt the tears welling to his eyes again, but he was not angry with his lot—he was only feeble and ill. Yes, he was too tired; the rain had wet him too much; he was nipped with cold, but the idea of going back to his great dark house in the Rue Miromesnil froze his heart. The house door at Nana's was not open as yet, and he had to wait till the porter made his appearance.

</p></origin><translate id="div_1495" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>听到她的叫声，斯泰内愣了一下，他停止了脚步。缪法在场出乎他的意料，他真反感，因为他害怕缪法作解释，所以三个月来，他一直回避这件事。他眨着眼睛，神色尴尬地摇摆着身子，看也不看伯爵一眼。他气喘吁吁，满脸通红，脸色变了样，好像一个人跑遍了巴黎，来报一则喜讯，却碰上一件倒霉的事。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1496');"><p>"Que veux-tu, toi?" asked Nana roughly, using the second person singular in open mockery of the count.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1496" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你要干什么，你？”娜娜生硬地问道，她用亲昵的人称来称呼斯泰内，以此来奚落伯爵。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1497');"><p>"What—what do I—" he stammered. "I've got it for you—you know what."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1497" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我……我……”斯泰内结结巴巴地说，“我有东西要交给你，你知道是什么东西。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1498');"><p>"Eh?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1498" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“什么东西？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1499');"><p>He hesitated. The day before yesterday she had given him to understand that if he could not find her a thousand francs to pay a bill with she would not receive him any more. For two days he had been loafing about the town in quest of the money and had at last made the sum up that very morning.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1499" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他犹豫了一下。前天晚上，她曾对他说，如果他不给她搞到一千法郎来给她还债，她就不再接待他了。两天来，他到处奔波，终于在今天上午才凑足了这笔钱。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1500');"><p>"The thousand francs!" he ended by declaring as he drew an envelope from his pocket.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1500" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你需要的一千法郎。”他终于开口了，一边从口袋里抽出一只信封。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1501');"><p>Nana had not remembered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1501" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这件事娜娜已经忘记了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1502');"><p>"The thousand francs!" she cried. "D'you think I'm begging alms? Now look here, that's what I value your thousand francs at!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1502" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一千法郎！”她嚷道，“我是乞求施舍的吗？……瞧！你看我是看中你这一千法郎！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1503');"><p>And snatching the envelope, she threw it full in his face. As became a prudent Hebrew, he picked it up slowly and painfully and then looked at the young woman with a dull expression of face. Muffat and he exchanged a despairing glance, while she put her arms akimbo in order to shout more loudly than before.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1503" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，她拿起信封，朝他的脸上扔去。斯泰内是个谨慎的犹太人，他吃力地把信封捡起来，用呆滞的目光看着娜娜。缪法同他交换了一下失望的眼色，而娜娜两手叉腰，嚷得更响了： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1504');"><p>"Come now, will you soon have done insulting me? I'm glad you've come, too, dear boy, because now you see the clearance'll be quite complete. Now then, gee up! Out you go!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1504" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂！你们侮辱我算完了吧！……你呀，亲爱的斯泰内，你也来了，我很高兴，你明白了吧，这样我就可以彻底打扫了……走吧，好了，滚吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1505');"><p>Then as they did not hurry in the least, for they were paralyzed:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1505" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们一点也不着急，一动也不动。她又说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1506');"><p>"D'you mean to say I'm acting like a fool, eh? It's likely enough! But you've bored me too much! And, hang it all, I've had enough of swelldom! If I die of what I'm doing—well, it's my fancy!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1506" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯！你们会说我在干一件蠢事吧？这很可能！但是你们把我烦死了！……呸！我干漂亮事已经干够了！如果我因干蠢事而死，我也死得其乐！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1507');"><p>They sought to calm her; they begged her to listen to reason.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1507" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们想叫她平静下来，他们恳求她。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1508');"><p>"Now then, once, twice, thrice! Won't you go? Very well! Look there! I've got company."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1508" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一，二，你们还赖着不走？……好吧，你们瞧，我还有人呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1509');"><p>And with a brisk movement she flung wide the bedroom door. Whereupon in the middle of the tumbled bed the two men caught sight of Fontan. He had not expected to be shown off in this situation; nevertheless, he took things very easily, for he was used to sudden surprises on the stage. Indeed, after the first shock he even hit upon a grimace calculated to tide him honorably over his difficulty; he "turned rabbit," as he phrased it, and stuck out his lips and wrinkled up his nose, so as completely to transform the lower half of his face. His base, satyrlike head seemed to exude incontinence. It was this man Fontan then whom Nana had been to fetch at the Varieties every day for a week past, for she was smitten with that fierce sort of passion which the grimacing ugliness of a low comedian is wont to inspire in the genus courtesan.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1509" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她用力一推，把卧室的门开得很大。于是两个男人瞥见丰唐躺在乱糟糟的床中间。丰唐没有料到会这样让他亮相。他翘着两条腿，睡衣敞开，像只公山羊躺在起皱的花边中间，露出一身黑皮。他并没有惊慌失措，因为他在舞台上什么惊险的场面都经历过。他开始吃了一惊，接着做了一个鬼脸来摆脱困境，他伸着嘴唇，翘着鼻子，脸部肌肉动个不停，用他的话来说，这叫扮兔子。他那副下流的色鬼嘴脸，充分暴露出他的淫荡的恶习。一个星期以来，娜娜每天到游艺剧院找丰唐，因为她也像某些娼妓一样，疯狂地爱上丑角演员的鬼脸了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1510');"><p>"There!" she said, pointing him out with tragic gesture.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1510" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“瞧吧！”她用演戏的动作指着丰唐说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1511');"><p>Muffat, who hitherto had pocketed everything, rebelled at this affront.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1511" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>缪法什么气都忍受过了，但是对这样的侮辱却忍受不了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1512');"><p>"Bitch!" he stammered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1512" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“婊子！”他嘟哝道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1513');"><p>But Nana, who was once more in the bedroom, came back in order to have the last word.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1513" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜已经进了卧室，又走回来，最后说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1514');"><p>"How am I a bitch? What about your wife?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1514" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说什么，婊子！那么，你的老婆呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1515');"><p>And she was off and, slamming the door with a bang, she noisily pushed to the bolt. Left alone, the two men gazed at one another in silence. Zoe had just come into the room, but she did not drive them out. Nay, she spoke to them in the most sensible manner. As became a woman with a head on her shoulders, she decided that Madame's conduct was rather too much of a good thing. But she defended her, nonetheless: this union with the play actor couldn't last; the madness must be allowed to pass off! The two men retired without uttering a sound. On the pavement outside they shook hands silently, as though swayed by a mutual sense of fraternity. Then they turned their backs on one another and went crawling off in opposite directions.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1515" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，她走回卧室，使劲关上门，然后哐当一声插上门栓。门外剩下两个男人，一声不吭，面面相觑。佐爱进来了，原来她并没有赶他们走，而是理解他们，和他们谈话。她是一个聪明人，她认为太太的蠢事做得有点过分。不过，她还是为她辩护，说她与那个丑角演员的关系长不了，应该让她这股狂热劲儿过了再说。两个男人走了。他们一句话也没说就走了。到了人行道上，他们很激动，彼此倒产生了友情，默默地握握手，然后转过脸，迈着沉重的步伐，分道扬镳了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1516');"><p>When at last Muffat entered his town house in the Rue Miromesnil his wife was just arriving. The two met on the great staircase, whose walls exhaled an icy chill. They lifted up their eyes and beheld one another. The count still wore his muddy clothes, and his pale, bewildered face betrayed the prodigal returning from his debauch. The countess looked as though she were utterly fagged out by a night in the train. She was dropping with sleep, but her hair had been brushed anyhow, and her eyes were deeply sunken.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1516" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>缪法回到米罗梅斯尼尔街的公馆时，他的老婆也刚刚到家。两个人在宽阔楼梯上相遇了，看见楼梯旁的阴森森的墙壁，两人不禁打了一个寒战。他们抬起头来，彼此看见了。伯爵的衣服上还留下泥巴的痕迹，他脸色苍白，神态慌张，像在外面干了丑事。伯爵夫人像坐了一夜火车，疲惫不堪，站着打盹，头发蓬乱，眼皮发黑。
