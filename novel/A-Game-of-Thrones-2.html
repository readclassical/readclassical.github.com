</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_112');"><p>The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king’s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran’s life.
</p></origin><translate id="div_112" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>晨色清冷，带着一丝寂寥，隐然暗示夏日将尽。为数二十人的队伍于破晓时分轻骑启程，布兰策马置身其间，满心焦虑又兴奋难耐。这次他年纪总算够大，可以与父兄同往刑场，目睹国王律法的执行。这是夏天的第九年，布兰现年七岁。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_113');"><p>The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran’s skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.
</p></origin><translate id="div_113" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>死囚已被领至小丘上的平房外，罗柏认为他是个誓死效忠“境外之王”曼斯•雷德的野人。布兰回想起老奶妈在火炉边说过的故事，不禁浑身起了鸡皮疙瘩。她说野人生性凶残蛮狠，个个都是贩卖奴隶、杀人放火的偷盗之徒。他们与巨人族和食尸鬼狼狈为奸，在暗夜里诱拐童女、以磨亮的兽角茹毛饮血。他们的女人则相传在远古的“长夜”里与异鬼苟合，繁衍半人半鬼的恐怖后代。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_114');"><p>But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king’s justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night’s Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_114" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而眼前这个老人却削瘦枯槁，比罗柏高不了多少，手脚紧缚身后，静待国王意旨发落。他在酷寒中因冻疮失去了双耳和一根手指，全身衣着漆黑，与守夜人弟兄们的臸服没有两样，只不过他的衣衫褴褛，而且脓疮四溢。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_115');"><p>The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he’d seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field.
</p></origin><translate id="div_115" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>人马呼息在清晨的冷空气里交织成蒸腾的雪白雾网，父亲下令将墙边的人犯松绑，抱到队伍前面。罗柏和琼恩直挺背脊，昂然跨坐鞍背；布兰则骑着小马在两人中间，努力想要表现出七岁孩童所没有的成熟气度，彷佛眼前一切他早已司空见惯。微风吹过栅门，众人头顶飘扬着临冬城史塔克家族的旗臶，上头画着白底灰色的冰原奔狼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_116');"><p>Bran’s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father’s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.
</p></origin><translate id="div_116" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲神情肃穆地骑在马上，满头棕色长发在风里飞扬。他修剪整齐的胡子冒出几缕白丝，看起来比三十五岁的实际年龄还要老些。这天他的灰色眼瞳严厉无情，怎么看也不像是那个会在风雪夜里端坐火炉前，娓娓细述远古英雄时代和森林之子（注解１）故事的人。他已经摘下慈父的容颜，而戴上了临冬城主史塔克公爵的面具，布兰心想。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_117');"><p>There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. "Ice," that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man’s hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_117" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>清晨的寒意里，布兰听到有人问了些问题，以及问题的答案，然而事后他却想不起来究竟说过了哪些话。总之最后父亲下了命令，两名卫士便把那衣衫褴褛的人拖到空地中央的铁树木桩前，把他的头硬是按在漆黑的坚硬木头上。艾德•史塔克解鞍下马，他的养子（注解２）席恩•葛雷乔伊立刻递上宝剑。剑叫做“寒冰”，剑身宽过手掌，立起来比罗柏还长。刺刀是用瓦雷利亚钢锻造而成，受过法术加持，颜色暗如黑烟。世上没有任河东西比瓦雷利亚钢更锐利。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_118');"><p>His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, "In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die." He lifted the greatsword high above his head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_118" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲脱下手套，交给侍卫队长乔里•凯索，然后双手擎剑，开口朗声说道：“以安达尔人、洛伊拿人及先民的国王，七国统治者（注解３）暨全境守护者，拜拉席恩家族的劳勃一世之名，我临冬城主与北境统领，史塔克家族的艾德，在此宣判你死刑。”语毕后，他高举巨剑过头。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_119');"><p>Bran’s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. "Keep the pony well in hand," he whispered. "And don’t look away. Father will know if you do."
</p></origin><translate id="div_119" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰的异母哥哥琼恩•雪诺凑了过来。“握紧缰绳，别让马儿乱动。还有千万别把头转开，不然父亲会知道的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_120');"><p>Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_120" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是布兰紧握缰绳，没让小马乱动，也没有把头转开。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_121');"><p>His father took off the man’s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.
</p></origin><translate id="div_121" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲巨剑一挥，利落地砍下死囚首级。鲜血溅洒在雪地上，殷红一如夏日的葡萄美酿。队伍中一匹马嘶声跃起，差点就要发狂乱跑。布兰目不转睛地直视血迹，树干旁的白雪饥渴地啜饮鲜血，在他的注视下迅速染成红色。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_122');"><p>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy’s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_122" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>人头翻过树根，滚至葛雷乔伊脚边。席恩是个身形精瘦，肤色黝黑的十九岁青年，对任何事物都觉得兴致勃勃。他咧嘴一笑，抬腿踢开人头。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_123');"><p>"Ass," Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran’s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. "You did well," Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.
</p></origin><translate id="div_123" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“混帐东西！”琼恩低声咒道，刻意放低声音不让葛雷乔伊听见。他伸手搭住布兰肩膀，布兰也转头看着自己的私生子哥哥。”你做得很好。“琼恩神情庄重地告诉他。琼恩今年十四岁，观看死刑对他来说已是司空见惯。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_124');"><p>It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.
</p></origin><translate id="div_124" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>冷风已息，暖阳高照，但返回临冬城的漫漫长路却似乎更加寒冷。布兰与兄长并骑，远远地走在队伍前头，他跨下小马气喘吁吁地跟上其他坐骑的迅捷脚步。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_125');"><p>"The deserter died bravely," Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother’s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. "He had courage, at the least."
</p></origin><translate id="div_125" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这逃兵死得挺勇敢。”罗柏说。高大壮硕的他每天都在长大，同时遗传了母亲的白皙肤色、红褐头发，以及徒利家族的蓝色眼眸。“不管怎么说，好歹他有点勇气。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_126');"><p>"No," Jon Snow said quietly. "It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark." Jon’s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.
</p></origin><translate id="div_126" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不对，”琼恩静静地说，“那不算是勇气。史塔克，这家伙正是因为害怕而死的，你可以从他的眼神里看出来。” 琼恩的灰色眼瞳颜色深得近乎墨黑，但世间少有事物能逃过他的观察。他与罗柏同年，但两人容貌大相径庭。罗柏肌肉发达，皮肤白皙，强壮而动作迅速；琼恩则是体格精瘦，肤色沉黑，举止优雅而敏捷。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_127');"><p>Robb was not impressed. "The Others take his eyes," he swore. "He died well. Race you to the bridge?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_127" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏不以为然。“叫异鬼把他眼睛给挖了吧，”他咒道，“他总算是死得壮烈。怎么样，比赛谁先到桥边？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_128');"><p>"Done," Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.
</p></origin><translate id="div_128" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一言为定。”琼恩语毕两脚往马肚一夹，纵马前奔。罗柏咒骂几句后也追了上去，两人沿着路径向前急驰。罗柏又叫又笑，琼恩则稳静专注。马蹄在两人身后溅起一片白色雪花。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_129');"><p>Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man’s eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb’s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_129" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰没有跟上去，他的小马没这般能耐。他方才见到了死囚的眼睛，现在陷入沉思。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_130');"><p>So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him. "Are you well, Bran?" he asked, not unkindly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_130" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>没过多久，罗柏的笑声渐远，林间归于寂静。 太过专注于沉思的他，丝毫没注意到其他队伍赶上自己，直到父亲骑到他身边，语带关切地问道：“布兰，你还好吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_131');"><p>"Yes, Father," Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. "Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he was afraid."
</p></origin><translate id="div_131" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“父亲大人，我很好。”布兰应答，他抬头仰望父亲，父亲穿着毛皮大衣和皮革护甲，骑在雄骏战马上如同巨人般笼罩住他。“罗柏说刚才那个人死得很勇敢，琼恩却说他死的时候很害怕。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_132');"><p>"What do you think?" his father asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_132" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你自己怎么想呢？”他的父亲问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_133');"><p>Bran thought about it. "Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_133" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰寻思片刻后反问：“一个人害怕的时候还能够勇敢么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_134');"><p>"That is the only time a man can be brave," his father told him. "Do you understand why I did it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_134" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一个人唯有在害怕的时候才能够勇敢。”父亲告诉他，“你知道为什么我要杀他么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_135');"><p>"He was a wildling," Bran said. "They carry off women and sell them to the Others."
</p></origin><translate id="div_135" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“因为他是野人，”布兰回答，“他们绑架女人，然后把她们卖给异鬼。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_136');"><p>His lord father smiled. "Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night’s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_136" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲微笑道：“老奶妈又跟你说那些故事了。那人其实是个逃兵，背弃了守夜人的誓言。世间最危险的人莫过于此，因为他们知道自己一旦被捕，只有死路一条，于是恶向胆边生，再怎么伤天害理的事也干得出来。不过你误解我的意思了，我不是问你他为什么要死，而是我为何要亲自行刑。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_137');"><p>Bran had no answer for that. "King Robert has a headsman," he said, uncertainly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_137" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰想不出答案。“我只知道劳勃国王有个刽子手。”他不太确定地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_138');"><p>"He does," his father admitted. "As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man’s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.
</p></origin><translate id="div_138" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他确实是有刽子手代劳，”他父亲承认，“在他之前的坦格利安王朝也是如此。但我们遵循古老的传统，史塔克家的人体内仍流有先民的血液，而我们相信判决死刑的人必须亲自动手。如果你要取人性命，你至少应该注视他的双眼，聆听他的临终遗言。假如做不到这点，那么或许他罪不致死。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_139');"><p>"One day, Bran, you will be Robb’s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is."
</p></origin><translate id="div_139" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“布兰，有朝一日你会成为罗柏的家臣，为你哥哥和国王治理属于你自己的领地，届时你也必须执掌律法。当那天来临的时候，你绝不可以杀戮为乐，亦不可逃避责任。统治者若是躲在幕后，付钱给刽子手执行，很快就会忘记死亡为何物。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_140');"><p>That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at them. "Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!" Then he was gone again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_140" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时琼恩出现在他们面前的坡值，他挥手朝下大喊：“父亲大人，布兰，快来看看罗柏找到了什么！“随即又消失在丘陵的彼方。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_141');"><p>Jory rode up beside them. "Trouble, my lord?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_141" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔里赶上前来，“大人，出事了么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_142');"><p>"Beyond a doubt," his lord father said. "Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now." He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after.
</p></origin><translate id="div_142" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那还用说，”他的领主父亲说道，“来罢，我们去看看我那调皮的儿子又闯了什么祸。” 他策马狂奔，乔里和布兰以及其他人也跟了上去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_143');"><p>They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.
</p></origin><translate id="div_143" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们在桥北河畔找到罗柏，琼恩仍在马上。这个月来晚夏的积雪沉厚，罗柏站在及膝深雪里，披风后敞，阳光在他发际闪耀。他怀里抱着不知什么东西，正和琼恩两人兴奋地窃语交谈。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_144');"><p>The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. "Gods!" he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword.
</p></origin><translate id="div_144" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>队伍骑着马小心地穿过河面的诸多漂浮物，寻找隐藏于雪地下崎岖地面的立足点。乔里•凯索和席恩•葛雷乔伊最先赶到男孩身边。葛雷乔伊原本还有说有笑，紧接着布兰却听见他倒抽一口气：“诸神保佑！”他惊叫着伸手拔剑，一边还挣扎着要稳住坐骑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_145');"><p>Jory’s sword was already out. "Robb, get away from it!" he called as his horse reared under him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_145" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔里的配剑已然出鞘，“罗柏，离那东西远点！”他才叫出声，坐骑便已前脚高举跳了起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_146');"><p>Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. "She can’t hurt you," he said. "She’s dead, Jory."
</p></origin><translate id="div_146" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏怀里抱着一团东西，这时嘻嘻笑着抬起头，“它伤不了你的，”他说道，“乔里，它已经死啦。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_147');"><p>Bran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran.
</p></origin><translate id="div_147" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰满心好奇，焦躁不安，一心只想叫鞍下小马再跑快点，但父亲却要他在桥边下马，徒步过去。他迫不及待地跳下马，三步并作两步地跑了过去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_148');"><p>By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. "What in the seven hells is it?" Greyjoy was saying.
</p></origin><translate id="div_148" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等他到的时候，琼恩、乔里和席恩•葛雷乔伊都已经下马了。“这是什么鬼东西？”葛雷乔伊喃喃说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_149');"><p>"A wolf," Robb told him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_149" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“狼。”罗柏告诉他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_150');"><p>"A freak," Greyjoy said. "Look at the size of it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_150" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“胡说，”葛雷乔伊反驳，“狼哪有这么大的？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_151');"><p>Bran’s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers’ side.
</p></origin><translate id="div_151" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰的心脏砰砰狂跳，推开一堆及腰的漂浮物，奔至兄长身旁。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_152');"><p>Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman’s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father’s kennel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_152" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一个巨大的暗黝身形半掩在血渍斑驳的雪堆埋，绵软而无生息。蓬松的灰色绒毛已经结冰，腐朽的气味紧附其间，就像是女人身上的香水那样，布兰隐约瞥见它无神的眼窝里爬满蛆虫，咧嘴内满是黄牙。但真正吓到他的是这只狼的大小，它比他的小马还大，比他父亲最大的猎大还要大上两倍。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_153');"><p>"It’s no freak," Jon said calmly. "That’s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind."
</p></origin><translate id="div_153" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我没骗你，”琼恩正色道，“这确实是冰原狼没错，因为他们比其他狼都还要来得大！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_154');"><p>Theon Greyjoy said, "There’s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years."
</p></origin><translate id="div_154" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>席恩•葛雷乔伊说：“可是两百年来，绝境长城以南没人见过半条冰原狼。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_155');"><p>"I see one now," Jon replied.
</p></origin><translate id="div_155" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“现在不就见到一只了吗？”琼恩回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_156');"><p>Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb’s arms. He gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb’s chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. "Go on," Robb told him. "You can touch him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_156" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰努力将视线扯离面前的怪物，这才注意到罗柏怀里抱着的东西。他高兴得叫了一声，随即靠过去。那只幼狼只是团灰黑色的毛球，双眼仍未张开。它盲目地往罗柏胸膛上磨踏，在他的皮护甲上寻找奶头，发出哀伤的低吟声。布兰有些犹豫地探出手，“没关系，”罗柏告诉他，“你可以摸摸看。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_157');"><p>Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, "Here you go." His half brother put a second pup into his arms. "There are five of them." Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek.
</p></origin><translate id="div_157" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰非常紧张，很快碰了小狼一下，听到琼恩的声音，他转过头。“瞧，这只是给你的。”他的私生子哥哥把第二头幼狼放进他怀里。“总共有五只呢。”布兰在雪地里坐下，把小狼温软的皮毛贴近自己脸颊。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_160');"><p>Father frowned. "This is only a dead animal, Jory," he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. "Do we know what killed her?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_160" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲皱起眉头。“乔里，不过是头死狼罢了。”他说道，但脸庞却蒙上了一层阴霾。他绕着狼尸，积雪在他脚下碎裂。“知道它被什么杀死的么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_161');"><p>"There’s something in the throat," Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even asked. "There, just under the jaw."
</p></origin><translate id="div_161" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喉咙里好像有东西。”罗柏得意地回答，暗自为他在父亲提出疑问前便找到解答感到骄傲。 “就在下巴底下。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_162');"><p>His father knelt and groped under the beast’s head with his hand. He gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_162" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的父亲蹲了下来，伸手探向狼尸的头底下，使劲一拧，举起让大家看。那是一只碎裂的鹿角，原本的分叉断尽，染满了鲜血。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_163');"><p>A sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_163" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一阵突如其来的寂静笼罩了队伍，众人局促不安地看着那只鹿角，没有人敢出声说话。布兰虽然不了解旁人为何惊恐，却也能感觉到他们的害怕。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_164');"><p>His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. "I’m surprised she lived long enough to whelp," he said. His voice broke the spell.
</p></origin><translate id="div_164" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲扔开鹿角，在雪地里把手清了干净。“没想到它还有力气把孩子生下来。”他的声音打破了先前的沉默。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_165');"><p>"Maybe she didn’t," Jory said. "I’ve heard tales?.?.?.?maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_168');"><p>Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_169');"><p>"The sooner the better," Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. "Give the beast here, Bran."
</p></origin><translate id="div_169" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我看死得越快越好，”席恩•葛雷乔伊同意，他抽出配剑。“布兰，把那东西丢过来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_170');"><p>The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. "No!" Bran cried out fiercely. "It’s mine."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_171');"><p>"Put away your sword, Greyjoy," Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, like the lord he would someday be. "We will keep these pups."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_174');"><p>Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. "Hullen speaks truly, son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation."
</p></origin><translate id="div_174" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰朝父亲望去，盼望能找到救兵，但只见到深锁双眉。“好儿子，胡伦说的没错。与其让它们挨饿受冻，不如趁早了结干脆。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_175');"><p>"No!" He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his father.
</p></origin><translate id="div_175" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不要！”他已经感觉到眼泪在眼眶里打转，于是转开目光，他可不想在父亲面前落泪。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_176');"><p>Robb resisted stubbornly. "Ser Rodrik’s red bitch whelped again last week," he said. "It was a small litter, only two live pups. She’ll have milk enough."
</p></origin><translate id="div_176" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏固执地继续抗拒。“罗德利克爵士的那头红母狗上礼拜才刚生产，”他说，“那胎死了不少，只有两只小狗活了下来，奶水应该还够它们喝。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_178');"><p>"Lord Stark," Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. "There are five pups," he told Father. "Three male, two female."
</p></origin><translate id="div_178" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“史塔克大人，”琼恩说道。听他如此正式地称呼自己父亲，实在很怪。布兰抱着最后一丝希望看着他。“总共有五只小狼，”他告诉父亲，“三只公的，两只母的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_179');"><p>"What of it, Jon?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_179" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“琼恩，这有什么意义么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_180');"><p>"You have five trueborn children," Jon said. "Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_180" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您有五个孩子，”琼恩回答，“三个儿子，两个女儿。冰原狼又是你们的家微，大人，您的孩子们注定要拥有这些小狼的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_181');"><p>Bran saw his father’s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.
</p></origin><translate id="div_181" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰看到父亲的脸色转变，其他人交换眼神，就在那一刻，他全心全意地爱着琼恩。 虽然他只有七岁，布兰仍旧很清楚自己的私生子哥哥这样做所代表的意义，他可是把自己排除在父亲的子嗣之外，才会刚好凑成数的。他把两个女孩都算了进去，甚至连襁褓中的小瑞肯也有分。但他却没有算冠着雪诺这个私生子姓氏的自己。雷诺这个姓氏是专门用来给那些在北方出生，却不幸没有父亲的人用的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_182');"><p>Their father understood as well. "You want no pup for yourself, Jon?" he asked softly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_182" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲也明白这点。“琼恩，你自己不想要小狼么？”他轻声问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_183');"><p>"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark," Jon pointed out. "I am no Stark, Father."
</p></origin><translate id="div_183" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“冰原狼是史塔克家族的辬志，”琼恩指出，“父亲大人，我并非史塔克家族一员啊。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_184');"><p>Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. "I will nurse him myself, Father," he promised. "I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_184" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲若有所思地看了琼恩一眼，罗柏急切地打破沉默。“父亲，我会亲自喂养小狼的。”他保证道，“我会用浸过温牛奶的湿毛巾喂它。“ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_185');"><p>"Me too!" Bran echoed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_185" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我也会。”布兰连忙跟进。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_186');"><p>The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. "Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not have you wasting the servants’ time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_186" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>公爵意味深长地审视儿子，“说起来简单，其要做可不容易。我不会让你们占用仆人时间的。如果你们更要养这群小狼，就得一切自己来，知道么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_187');"><p>Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue.
</p></origin><translate id="div_187" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰热切地忙点头，小狼蜷缩在他怀里，伸出温热的舌头舔了他的脸颊。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_188');"><p>"You must train them as well," their father said. "You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip a man’s arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_188" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们还得亲自训练它们，”父亲又道，“我保证驯兽长和这些怪物将毫无干系。倘若你们把它们训练得残忍成性，或有什么闪失，那么就祈祷天上诸神保佑吧。这些可不是讨好卖乖的狗，也不是随便踢一脚就能打发的角色。冰原狼要扯下人的胳膊就和狗杀老鼠一样简单，你们确定要养么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_189');"><p>"Yes, Father," Bran said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_189" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，父亲大人。”布兰答道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_190');"><p>"Yes," Robb agreed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_190" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯。”罗柏同意道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_191');"><p>"The pups may die anyway, despite all you do."
</p></origin><translate id="div_191" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“即使你们费尽苦心，小狼还是有夭折的可能。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_192');"><p>"They won’t die," Robb said. "We won’t let them die."
</p></origin><translate id="div_192" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不会，”罗柏说，“我们不会让它们死掉的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_193');"><p>"Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It’s time we were back to Winterfell."
</p></origin><translate id="div_193" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那就留着它们吧。乔里，戴斯蒙，把其他几只小狼也都带着，我们也该回临冬城去了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_194');"><p>It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_194" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一直到他们骑马踏上归途，布兰才允许自己享受胜利的喜悦。他的小狼正安全地藏靠在他的皮护甲里，他不禁想该为它取什么名字才好。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_195');"><p>Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_195" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>走到桥中间时，琼恩突然勒住马缰。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_196');"><p>"What is it, Jon?" their lord father asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_196" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“琼恩，怎么了？”公爵父亲问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_197');"><p>"Can’t you hear it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_197" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们没听到么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_198');"><p>Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.
</p></origin><translate id="div_198" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰只听见林间风声和达达马蹄，怀间嗷嗷待哺的五只小狼，但琼恩正侧耳倾听别的事物。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_199');"><p>"There," Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_199" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在那里。”琼恩道，他掉转马头，急驰过桥，大家看着他在母狼尸体旁下马，看着他屈膝跪下，一会儿后他骑马回来，笑容满面。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_200');"><p>"He must have crawled away from the others," Jon said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_200" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这只一定是先爬开了。”琼恩说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_201');"><p>"Or been driven away," their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.
</p></origin><translate id="div_201" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“或是被赶开的。”他们的父亲看着第六只小狼说道。它的毛色净白，其他的小狼则多半灰黑，它的眼瞳红如早上死囚的鲜血。布兰很觉好奇，为何其他小狼眼睛都还没睁开，唯独它双目炯炯有神。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_202');"><p>"An albino," Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. "This one will die even faster than the others."
