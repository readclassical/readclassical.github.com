</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5044');"><p>It was too far to make out the banners clearly, but even through the drifting fog she could see that they were white, with a dark smudge in their center that could only be the direwolf of Stark, grey upon its icy field. When she saw it with her own eyes, Catelyn reined up her horse and bowed her head in thanks. The gods were good. She was not too late.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5044" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>虽然距离尚远，无法看清旗臶上的图案，但透过迷朦雾气，她依旧瞧得出那是白色旌旗，中间暗色一点只可能是史塔克家族的灰色冰原奔狼。一会儿，待亲眼目睹之后，凯特琳勒住马缰，低头感谢天上诸神，她总算没有来得太迟。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5045');"><p>"They await our coming, my lady," Ser Wylis Manderly said, "as my lord father swore they would."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5045" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，他们正等着我们过去呢，”威里斯•曼德勒爵士道，“如我父亲所保证的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5046');"><p>"Let us not keep them waiting any longer, ser." Ser Brynden Tully put the spurs to his horse and trotted briskly toward the banners. Catelyn rode beside him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5046" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那我们就别让他们再等下去吧，爵士先生。”布林登•徒利爵士轻踢马刺，快步朝前奔去，凯特琳策马与之并肩而行。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5047');"><p>Ser Wylis and his brother Ser Wendel followed, leading their levies, near fifteen hundred men: some twenty-odd knights and as many squires, two hundred mounted lances, swordsmen, and freeriders, and the rest foot, armed with spears, pikes and tridents. Lord Wyman had remained behind to see to the defenses of White Harbor. A man of near sixty years, he had grown too stout to sit a horse. "If I had thought to see war again in my lifetime, I should have eaten a few less eels," he’d told Catelyn when he met her ship, slapping his massive belly with both hands. His fingers were fat as sausages. "My boys will see you safe to your son, though, have no fear."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5047" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>威里斯爵士和他的弟弟文德尔爵士跟在后面，率领着为数将近一千五百名士兵：其中包括二十来位骑士和相同数目的侍从，两百名或持枪或佩剑的骑马战士与自由骑手，其余则是配备长矛、长枪和三叉戟的步兵。威曼伯爵留在后方负责白港的防御，他已年过六旬，体态臃肿得无法再骑马作战。“我若知道这辈子还会遇上打仗，就应该少吃几条鳗鱼。”前来接船时，他这么对凯特琳说，一边还双手拍拍大肚子，那指头肥得跟香肠没两样。“不过呢，您用不着担心，我家这两个小鬼会护送您平安达到您儿子那边的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5048');"><p>His "boys" were both older than Catelyn, and she might have wished that they did not take after their father quite so closely. Ser Wylis was only a few eels short of not being able to mount his own horse; she pitied the poor animal. Ser Wendel, the younger boy, would have been the fattest man she’d ever known, had she only neglected to meet his father and brother. Wylis was quiet and formal, Wendel loud and boisterous; both had ostentatious walrus mustaches and heads as bare as a baby’s bottom; neither seemed to own a single garment that was not spotted with food stains. Yet she liked them well enough; they had gotten her to Robb, as their father had vowed, and nothing else mattered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5048" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的两个“小鬼”年纪都比凯特琳大，她还真希望他父子三人不要长得那么相像。威里斯爵士若是再重一点，大概也骑不成马了；她真心怜悯他的坐骑。年纪较轻的文德尔爵士也算得上是她所矢口最胖的人——假如她没遇见他父亲和哥哥的话。威里斯为人沉默多礼，文德尔则粗声粗气，两人都有大把海象式的长胡子，头秃得像新生婴儿的屁股，而且几乎每件衣服都沾染了食物痕迹。不过，她挺喜欢他们，他们依约护送她到了罗柏身边，如他们父亲所保证的，这样就足够了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5049');"><p>She was pleased to see that her son had sent eyes out, even to the east. The Lannisters would come from the south when they came, but it was good that Robb was being careful. My son is leading a host to war, she thought, still only half believing it. She was desperately afraid for him, and for Winterfell, yet she could not deny feeling a certain pride as well. A year ago he had been a boy. What was he now? she wondered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5049" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>看到儿子连东边也派出了斥候，她感到很高兴。兰尼斯特军出现时会在南方，但罗柏谨慎行事毕竟是好的。我儿正领军出征，她心里想，依然不太敢相信。她非常为他，也为临冬城担心害怕，但她不能否认心里也同样感到骄傲。一年之前，他还只是个孩子，如今的他变成什么样了?她不禁纳闷。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5050');"><p>Outriders spied the Manderly banners, the white merman with trident in hand, rising from a blue-green sea, and hailed them warmly. They were led to a spot of high ground dry enough for a camp. Ser Wylis called a halt there, and remained behind with his men to see the fires laid and the horses tended, while his brother Wendel rode on with Catelyn and her uncle to present their father’s respects to their liege lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5050" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>骑马斥候看见了曼德勒家族的旗臶——手握三叉戟的白色人鱼，自蓝绿海洋中缓缓升起——便热情地招呼他们。他们被领到一处干燥、可供扎营的高地，威里斯爵士命令军队停在那里，升起营火，照料马匹。他的弟弟文德尔则陪伴凯特琳和她叔叔，代表他父亲去向少主致意。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5051');"><p>The ground under their horses’ hooves was soft and wet. It fell away slowly beneath them as they rode past smoky peat fires, lines of horses, and wagons heavy-laden with hardbread and salt beef. On a stony outcrop of land higher than the surrounding country, they passed a lord’s pavilion with walls of heavy sailcloth. Catelyn recognized the banner, the bull moose of the Hornwoods, brown on its dark orange field.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5051" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>马蹄下的土地湿软不堪，随着踩踏缓缓下陷。他们行经煤烟袅袅的营火，一排排的战马，满载硬面包和咸牛肉的货车。在一个地势较高的裸岩上，他们经过了一座用厚重帆布搭建而成的领主帐篷。凯特琳认出霍伍德家族的旗臶，褐色驼鹿衬着暗橙色底。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5052');"><p>Just beyond, through the mists, she glimpsed the walls and towers of Moat Cailin?.?.?.?or what remained of them. Immense blocks of black basalt, each as large as a crofter’s cottage, lay scattered and tumbled like a child’s wooden blocks, half-sunk in the soft boggy soil. Nothing else remained of a curtain wall that had once stood as high as Winterfell’s. The wooden keep was gone entirely, rotted away a thousand years past, with not so much as a timber to mark where it had stood. All that was left of the great stronghold of the First Men were three towers?.?.?.?three where there had once been twenty, if the taletellers could be believed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5052" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>稍远处，透过雾气，她瞥见了卡林湾的高墙塔楼……或者应该说，高墙塔楼的遗迹。一块块大如农舍的黑色玄武岩四处倾颓，活像小孩的积木，半沉进湿软的沼地泥泞。而由它们所筑成的、曾与临冬城等高的城墙，业已完全消失；木造的堡楼更在千年前便已腐烂蛀蚀』口今连半根木头都不剩，再也看不出辉煌一时的痕迹。先民所建筑的雄伟要塞只剩三座高塔……而说书人却说古时曾有二十座。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5053');"><p>The Gatehouse Tower looked sound enough, and even boasted a few feet of standing wall to either side of it. The Drunkard’s Tower, off in the bog where the south and west walls had once met, leaned like a man about to spew a bellyful of wine into the gutter. And the tall, slender Children’s Tower, where legend said the children of the forest had once called upon their nameless gods to send the hammer of the waters, had lost half its crown. It looked as if some great beast had taken a bite out of the crenellations along the tower top, and spit the rubble across the bog. All three towers were green with moss. A tree was growing out between the stones on the north side of the Gatehouse Tower, its gnarled limbs festooned with ropy white blankets of ghostskin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5053" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“城门塔”看来还算完整，左右两边甚至还有几尺城墙。“醉鬼塔”陷在泽地边缘，位于过去南墙和西墙交会的地方，如今倾斜得厉害，有如一位准备吐出满肚子酒水的醉汉。相传，森林之子便是在高瘦尖细的“森林之子塔”顶召唤他们的无名诸神，送出巨浪的惩罚，如今塔尖少了一半，看上去像是有只大怪兽咬了一口塔楼雉堞，随后又把它吐进沼泽。三座塔楼均爬满青苔，有棵树从城门塔北面石墙缝隙间长出，盘根错节，表面覆盖着幽灵般苍白的坏死树皮。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5054');"><p>"Gods have mercy," Ser Brynden exclaimed when he saw what lay before them. "This is Moat Cailin? It’s no more than a..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5054" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸神慈悲，”看到眼前的景象，布林登爵士不禁吃了一惊，“这就是卡林湾?这不过是个——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5055');"><p>"...death trap," Catelyn finished. "I know how it looks, Uncle. I thought the same the first time I saw it, but Ned assured me that this ruin is more formidable than it seems. The three surviving towers command the causeway from all sides, and any enemy must pass between them. The bogs here are impenetrable, full of quicksands and suckholes and teeming with snakes. To assault any of the towers, an army would need to wade through waist-deep black muck, cross a moat full of lizard-lions, and scale walls slimy with moss, all the while exposing themselves to fire from archers in the other towers." She gave her uncle a grim smile. "And when night falls, there are said to be ghosts, cold vengeful spirits of the north who hunger for southron blood."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5055" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“——死亡陷阱。”凯特琳接口道：“叔叔，我知道这里看起来很不起眼，我初次见到时也这么想，但奈德向我保证，这片‘废墟’远比看起来要易守难攻。残存的三塔从三个方面控臸堤道，任何北上的敌人都必须从他们中间通过，因为沼泽充满流沙和陷坑，毒蛇肆虐其间，无法穿越。而若要攻打其中一塔，军队必须舒过深至腰部的黑色泥泞，跨越蜥狮出没的护城河，再登上长满青苔、滑溜异常的城墙，同时从头到尾都暴露在另外两塔弓箭手的箭雨之下。”她故作严峻地朝叔叔一笑，“入夜之后，据说这里闹鬼，有很多充满恨意的北方幽魂等着吸南方人的鲜血。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5056');"><p>Ser Brynden chuckled. "Remind me not to linger here. Last I looked, I was southron myself."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5056" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布林登爵士笑道：“记得提醒我别在此逗留太久。我上次照镜子时，看到自己还是个南方人哪。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5057');"><p>Standards had been raised atop all three towers. The Karstark sunburst hung from the Drunkard’s Tower, beneath the direwolf; on the Children’s Tower it was the Greatjon’s giant in shattered chains. But on the Gatehouse Tower, the Stark banner flew alone. That was where Robb had made his seat. Catelyn made for it, with Ser Brynden and Ser Wendel behind her, their horses stepping slowly down the log-and-plank road that had been laid across the green-and-black fields of mud.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5057" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>三座塔顶均竖起了旗臶。醉鬼塔上的是卡史塔克家族的日芒旗，飘扬于冰原狼旗臶下；森林之子塔上则是大琼恩的碎链巨人；但城门塔顶仅有史塔克家族的旗臶，罗柏当是选该处作为指挥部。于是凯特琳朝那里走去，布林登爵士和文德尔爵士跟在后面，他们的坐骑缓缓走过铺于黑绿泥泞上的木板桥。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5058');"><p>She found her son surrounded by his father’s lords bannermen, in a drafty hall with a peat fire smoking in a black hearth. He was seated at a massive stone table, a pile of maps and papers in front of him, talking intently with Roose Bolton and the Greatjon. At first he did not notice her?.?.?.?but his wolf did. The great grey beast was lying near the fire, but when Catelyn entered he lifted his head, and his golden eyes met hers. The lords fell silent one by one, and Robb looked up at the sudden quiet and saw her. "Mother?" he said, his voice thick with emotion.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5058" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她在一个通风的大厅找到儿子。此时，他的身边围绕着父亲的封臣，黑火炉里烧着燃煤，他坐在一张巨大的石桌前，面前堆满地图和各式纸张，正聚精会神地与卢斯•波顿和大琼恩讨论战略。他起初没注意到她……是他的狼先发现了。那头大灰狼原本趴在火炉边，凯特琳刚进门，它便抬起头，金色的眸子与她四日相交。诸侯们纷纷安静下来，罗柏察觉到突来的静默，也抬起头。“母亲?”他的声音充满感情。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5059');"><p>Catelyn wanted to run to him, to kiss his sweet brow, to wrap him in her arms and hold him so tightly that he would never come to harm?.?.?.?but here in front of his lords, she dared not. He was playing a man’s part now, and she would not take that away from him. So she held herself at the far end of the basalt slab they were using for a table. The direwolf got to his feet and padded across the room to where she stood. It seemed bigger than a wolf ought to be. "You’ve grown a beard," she said to Robb, while Grey Wind sniffed her hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5059" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳好想飞奔过去，亲吻他甜美的双眉，将他紧紧搂住，再不让他受任何伤害……然而在众多诸侯面前，她不敢这么做。眼下他扮演的是男人的角色，她说什么也不能剥夺他的权力。于是她让自己站在人们权作长桌的玄武岩石板末端。冰原狼起身，轻步穿过大厅，走到她身边。她没见过这么大的狼。“你留了胡子。”她对罗柏说，灰风则嗅嗅她的手。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5060');"><p>He rubbed his stubbled jaw, suddenly awkward. "Yes." His chin hairs were redder than the ones on his head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5060" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他摸摸长满胡茬的下巴，好像突然觉得不太习惯。“是啊。”他的胡须比头发更红。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5061');"><p>"I like it." Catelyn stroked the wolfs head, gently. "It makes you look like my brother Edmure." Grey Wind nipped at her fingers, playful, and trotted back to his place by the fire.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5061" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我挺喜欢你这样子，”凯特琳温柔地摸摸狼头，“你看起来很像我弟弟艾德慕。”灰风玩闹似地咬咬她的手指，然后快步跑回火边。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5062');"><p>Ser Helman Tallhart was the first to follow the direwolf across the room to pay his respects, kneeling before her and pressing his brow to her hand. "Lady Catelyn," he said, "you are fair as ever, a welcome sight in troubled times." The Glovers followed, Galbart and Robett, and Greatjon Umber, and the rest, one by one. Theon Greyjoy was the last. "I had not looked to see you here, my lady," he said as he knelt.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5062" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>赫曼•陶哈爵士率先追随冰原狼穿过房间向她致意，他在她面前单膝跪下，将额头按上她的手。“凯特琳夫人，”他说，“您依旧如此美丽，在当今的动乱时刻，见到您真是令人宽心。”葛洛佛家的盖伯特和罗贝特、大琼恩以及其他封臣也陆续上前致意。席恩•葛雷乔伊是最后一个。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5063');"><p>"I had not thought to be here," Catelyn said, "until I came ashore at White Harbor, and Lord Wyman told me that Robb had called the banners. You know his son, Ser Wendel." Wendel Manderly stepped forward and bowed as low as his girth would allow. "And my uncle, Ser Brynden Tully, who has left my sister’s service for mine."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5063" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，没想到会在这里见到您。”说着他单膝跪下。 “我也没想到会来这里，”凯特琳道，“我在白港登岸后，威曼大人告诉我罗柏业已召集封臣，我才临时改变了主意。你们应该都认识他的儿子，文德尔爵士。”文德尔•曼德勒走上前来，极尽腰带所能容许的程度，向众人弯腰行礼。“这是我叔叔布林登爵士，他离开了我妹妹，前来协助我方。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5064');"><p>"The Blackfish," Robb said. "Thank you for joining us, ser. We need men of your courage. And you, Ser Wendel, I am glad to have you here. Is Ser Rodrik with you as well, Mother? I’ve missed him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5064" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“黑鱼大人，”罗柏说，“感谢您加入我们，我们正需要像您这般勇武的人。文德尔爵士，我也很高兴得到您的协助。母亲，罗德利克爵士可有同你一道归来?我很想念他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5065');"><p>"Ser Rodrik is on his way north from White Harbor. I have named him castellan and commanded him to hold Winterfell till our return. Maester Luwin is a wise counsellor, but unskilled in the arts of war."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5065" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“罗德利克爵士自白港往北去了，我己任命他为代理城主，令他守护临冬城，直到我们返回。鲁温学士虽然学识渊博，毕竟不擅战争之事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5066');"><p>"Have no fear on that count, Lady Stark," the Greatjon told her in his bass rumble. "Winterfell is safe. We’ll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister’s bunghole soon enough, begging your pardons, and then it’s on to the Red Keep to free Ned."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5066" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“史塔克夫人，您毋需担心，”大琼恩声如洪钟地告诉她，“临冬城不会有事。而咱们过不了多久就会拿剑捅进兰尼斯特的屁眼，唉，说话粗鲁还请见谅，然后呢，咱们就一路杀进红堡，把奈德给救出来。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5067');"><p>"My lady, a question, as it please you." Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, had a small voice, yet when he spoke larger men quieted to listen. His eyes were curiously pale, almost without color, and his look disturbing. "It is said that you hold Lord Tywin’s dwarf son as captive. Have you brought him to us? I vow, we should make good use of such a hostage."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5067" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，如果您不见怪，我有个问题想请教。”恐怖堡领主卢斯•波顿的声音极其细小，然而当他开口讲话时，再高大的人都会安静倾听。他的眼瞳颜色淡得出奇，几乎无从描绘，而他的眼神更是令人烦乱。“听说您逮捕了泰温大人的侏儒儿子，不知您是否把他也带来了?我对天发誓，我们会好好利用这个人臼。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5068');"><p>"I did hold Tyrion Lannister, but no longer," Catelyn was forced to admit. A chorus of consternation greeted the news. "I was no more pleased than you, my lords. The gods saw fit to free him, with some help from my fool of a sister." She ought not to be so open in her contempt, she knew, but her parting from the Eyrie had not been pleasant. She had offered to take Lord Robert with her, to foster him at Winterfell for a few years. The company of other boys would do him good, she had dared to suggest. Lysa’s rage had been frightening to behold. "Sister or no," she had replied, "if you try to steal my son, you will leave by the Moon Door." After that there was no more to be said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5068" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的确逮捕了提利昂•兰尼斯特，只可惜他现下已不在我手上了。”凯特琳不得不承认。此话一出，四周立即响起阵阵错愕之声。“诸位大人，我也不希望此事发生，然而天上诸神有意放他自由，更加上我那妹妹愚行所致。”她自矢口不应如此明显 地流露对妹妹的轻蔑，但鹰巢城一别实在很不愉快。她原本提议带小劳勃公爵同行，让他在临冬城住上一段时日，她更大胆表示，与其他几个男孩作伴，应该对他很有好处。然而莱沙的怒意简直让人看了都害怕。“我管你是不是我姐姐，”她回答， “你敢偷我儿子，就给我从月门出去!”在那之后，什么都不用说了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5069');"><p>The lords were anxious to question her further, but Catelyn raised a hand. "No doubt we will have time for all this later, but my journey has fatigued me. I would speak with my son alone. I know you will forgive me, my lords." She gave them no choice; led by the ever-obliging Lord Hornwood, the bannermen bowed and took their leave. "And you, Theon," she added when Greyjoy lingered. He smiled and left them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5069" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>北境诸侯急于进一步探询相关消息，但凯特琳举起一只手。“我们稍后一定有时间谈，眼下我长途跋舒，颇感疲惫，只想单独和我儿子讲几句。相信诸位大人必会谅解。”她让他们别无选择，于是在向来遵从命令的霍伍德伯爵率领下，封臣们纷纷鞠躬离开。“席恩，你也是。”看到葛雷乔伊留了下来，她又补上这句。他微笑着走开。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5070');"><p>There was ale and cheese on the table. Catelyn tilled a horn, sat, sipped, and studied her son. He seemed taller than when she’d left, and the wisps of beard did make him look older. "Edmure was sixteen when he grew his first whiskers."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5070" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>桌上有麦酒和乳酪，凯特琳倒了一角杯，坐下来，小啜一口之后，细细端详儿子。他似乎比她离开时长得高了些，一点胡子也确让他看起来年纪大了不少。“艾德慕是从十六岁开始留胡子的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5071');"><p>"I will be sixteen soon enough," Robb said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5071" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我很快就满十六岁了。”罗柏说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5072');"><p>"And you are fifteen now. Fifteen, and leading a host to battle. Can you understand why I might fear, Robb?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5072" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“但你现在是十五岁，才十五岁，就带领大军投入战场。罗柏，你能理解我的担忧吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5073');"><p>His look grew stubborn. "There was no one else."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5073" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的眼神倔强起来。“除了我没别人了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5074');"><p>"No one?" she said. "Pray, who were those men I saw here a moment ago? Roose Bolton, Rickard Karstark, Galbart and Robett Glover, the Greatjon, Helman Tallhart?.?.?.?you might have given the command to any of them. Gods be good, you might even have sent Theon, though he would not be my choice."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5074" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没别人?”她说，“你倒是说说，我几分钟前见到的那些人是谁?卢斯•波顿、瑞卡德•卡史塔克、盖伯特•葛洛佛与罗贝特•葛洛佛，还有大琼恩、赫曼•陶哈……你大可把指挥权交给他们中的任何一人。诸神有眼，你就算派席恩都成，虽说我不会选他。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5075');"><p>"They are not Starks," he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5075" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们不是史塔克。”他说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5076');"><p>"They are men, Robb, seasoned in battle. You were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5076" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们是成年人，罗柏，他们经验丰富。而不到一年前，你还拿着木剑在练习呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5077');"><p>She saw anger in his eyes at that, but it was gone as quick as it came, and suddenly he was a boy again. "I know," he said, abashed. "Are you?.?.?.?are you sending me back to Winterfell?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5077" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>听到这句话，她看到他眼里闪现怒意，但那火光稍现即逝，转眼间他又变回了大男孩。“我知道，”他困窘地说，“那你……你要把我送回临冬城去吗? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5078');"><p>Catelyn sighed. "I should. You ought never have left. Yet I dare not, not now. You have come too far. Someday these lords will look to you as their liege. If I pack you off now, like a child being sent to bed without his supper, they will remember, and laugh about it in their cups. The day will come when you need them to respect you, even fear you a little. Laughter is poison to fear. I will not do that to you, much as I might wish to keep you safe."

Some may even go over to the Lannisters. Then the queen, with that much less to fear, can do as she likes with her prisoners. Our best hope, our only true hope, is that you can defeat the foe in the field. If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive, why then a trade might very well be possible, but that is not the heart of it.

Only it was a trap. Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him, the king’s banner be damned, and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the Mummer’s Ford. This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped, no one is certain, but Ser Raymun was killed, and most of our men from Winterfell.
