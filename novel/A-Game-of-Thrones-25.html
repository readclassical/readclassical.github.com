</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2110');"><p>In the yard below, Rickon ran with the wolves.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2110" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>瑞肯在下方的庭院里与狼一同奔跑嬉闹。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2111');"><p>Bran watched from his window seat. Wherever the boy went, Grey Wind was there first, loping ahead to cut him off, until Rickon saw him, screamed in delight, and went pelting off in another direction. Shaggydog ran at his heels, spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close. His fur had darkened until he was all black, and his eyes were green fire. Bran’s Summer came last. He was silver and smoke, with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see. Smaller than Grey Wind, and more wary. Bran thought he was the smartest of the litter. He could hear his brother’s breathless laughter as Rickon dashed across the hard-packed earth on little baby legs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2111" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰从窗台上看着这一切。不论小男孩跑到哪里，灰风总是抢先一步，跨步截断他的路，瑞肯看到他，兴奋地尖叫，然后又朝另一个方向奔去。毛毛狗和他寸步不离，若是其他狼靠得太近就转身咆哮。它的毛色已经变深，如今通体漆黑，眼睛如一团绿火。布兰的夏天落在最后，他的毛色乃是银白和烟灰相间，金黄的眼睛异常敏锐。它的块头比灰风稍小，却更机警。布兰私下认为它是狼群里最聪明的一只。看着瑞肯鼓动那双娃娃腿，在硬泥地上来回奔跑，布兰可以听见弟弟气喘吁吁的笑声。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2112');"><p>His eyes stung. He wanted to be down there, laughing and running. Angry at the thought, Bran knuckled away the tears before they could fall. His eighth name day had come and gone. He was almost a man grown now, too old to cry.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2112" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他只觉眼睛刺痛。他好想下去，好想笑闹跑跳。布兰越想越气，赶紧在眼泪掉下以前用指节抹掉。他的八岁命名日来了又去，他已经接近成年，不能再哭了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2113');"><p>"It was just a lie," he said bitterly, remembering the crow from his dream. "I can’t fly. I can’t even run."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2113" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“都是骗人的，”他苦涩地说，想起了梦中的乌鸦。“我不会飞，连跑都没办法。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2114');"><p>"Crows are all liars," Old Nan agreed, from the chair where she sat doing her needlework. "I know a story about a crow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2114" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“乌鸦本来就很会说谎。”坐在椅子上做针线活的老奶妈附议。“我知道一个乌鸦的故事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2115');"><p>"I don’t want any more stories," Bran snapped, his voice petulant. He had liked Old Nan and her stories once. Before. But it was different now. They left her with him all day now, to watch over him and clean him and keep him from being lonely, but she just made it worse. "I hate your stupid stories."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2115" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不要听故事，”布兰语气暴躁地斥道。他曾经很喜欢老奶妈和她说的那些故事。但那都是过去的事，现在情形不一样了。他们要她整天陪着他，让她照顾他，为他洗澡，以免他寂寞孤单，但她的存在却只让事情更糟。“我恨你那些蠢故事。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2116');"><p>The old woman smiled at him toothlessly. "My stories? No, my little lord, not mine. The stories are, before me and after me, before you too."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2116" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老妇人张开无牙的嘴对他微笑，“我的故事？不对，我的小少爷，不是我的。这些故事早在你我出生之前就已经存在了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2117');"><p>She was a very ugly old woman, Bran thought spitefully; shrunken and wrinkled, almost blind, too weak to climb stairs, with only a few wisps of white hair left to cover a mottled pink scalp. No one really knew how old she was, but his father said she’d been called Old Nan even when he was a boy. She was the oldest person in Winterfell for certain, maybe the oldest person in the Seven Kingdoms. Nan had come to the castle as a wet nurse for a Brandon Stark whose mother had died birthing him. He had been an older brother of Lord Rickard, Bran’s grandfather, or perhaps a younger brother, or a brother to Lord Rickard’s father. Sometimes Old Nan told it one way and sometimes another. In all the stories the little boy died at three of a summer chill, but Old Nan stayed on at Winterfell with her own children. She had lost both her sons to the war when King Robert won the throne, and her grandson was killed on the walls of Pyke during Balon Greyjoy’s rebellion. Her daughters had long ago married and moved away and died. All that was left of her own blood was Hodor, the simpleminded giant who worked in the stables, but Old Nan just lived on and on, doing her needlework and telling her stories.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2117" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她真是个丑老太婆，布兰恶毒地想：佝偻着缩成一团，满脸皱纹，眼睛差不多瞎掉，连爬楼梯的力气都没有，满是斑点的粉红头皮上只剩几小撮白发。没人知道她究竟有多老，父亲说他小时候大家就已经叫她老奶妈了。她无疑是临冬城里最老的人，说不定是七国里最老的寿星。她初来城堡，是为当布兰登•史塔克奶妈，因为他的母亲在生他的时候难产而死。此人是布兰的祖父瑞卡德公爵的哥哥，或许是弟弟，或是瑞卡德公爵父亲的兄弟。老奶妈每次说的都不一样。但不管哪个版本，故事里那小男孩总死于三岁时夏天的一场风寒，老奶妈和她的孩子们却在临冬城长住下来。她的两个儿子都死于劳勃国王夺取王位的那场战争，她的孙子则在平定巴陇葛雷乔伊叛变时于派克的城墙上殉难。她的女儿们早已陆续远嫁他乡，现在也都不在人世。如今她的血脉只剩下阿多，就是那个头脑简单，在马房里工作的巨人。只有老奶妈依旧好端端地活着，继续做她的针线，说她的故事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2118');"><p>"I don’t care whose stories they are," Bran told her, "I hate them." He didn’t want stories and he didn’t want Old Nan. He wanted his mother and father. He wanted to go running with Summer loping beside him. He wanted to climb the broken tower and feed corn to the crows. He wanted to ride his pony again with his brothers. He wanted it to be the way it had been before.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2118" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我才不管是谁的故事。”布兰告诉她，“我就是讨厌它们。”他不想听故事，也不要老奶妈。他想要父亲母亲，想到外面尽情奔跑，让夏天陪在身边。他想爬上残塔，喂乌鸦吃玉米。他想跨上他的小马，和两个哥哥一起驱驰。他想要一切都回到从前的样子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2119');"><p>"I know a story about a boy who hated stories," Old Nan said with her stupid little smile, her needles moving all the while, click click click, until Bran was ready to scream at her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2119" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道有个故事是在讲讨厌听故事的小男孩。”老奶妈露出她那蠢笨的笑容说，她手中的针同时还穿梭个不停，喀，喀，喀，听得布兰直想对她尖叫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2120');"><p>It would never be the way it had been, he knew. The crow had tricked him into flying, but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed. They had all left him, his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard brother Jon. His father had promised he would ride a real horse to King’s Landing, but they’d gone without him. Maester Luwin had sent a bird after Lord Eddard with a message, and another to Mother and a third to Jon on the Wall, but there had been no answers. "Ofttimes the birds are lost, child," the maester had told him. "There’s many a mile and many a hawk between here and King’s Landing, the message may not have reached them." Yet to Bran it felt as if they had all died while he had slept ?.?.?.?or perhaps Bran had died, and they had forgotten him. Jory and Ser Rodrik and Vayon Poole had gone too, and Hullen and Harwin and Fat Tom and a quarter of the guard.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2120" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他知道一切都回不去了。乌鸦骗他飞，结果他醒来之后，不但两脚残废，世界也都改变。父亲母亲和两个姐姐弃他而去，甚至连私生子哥哥琼恩也不告而别。父亲原本答应让他骑真正的骏马前往君临，但他们没等他便动身南下。鲁温师傅差了一只鸟把他醒来的消息带给艾德公爵，又派一只给母亲，一只给守卫长城的琼恩，然而全都音信杳然。“孩子，鸟儿常常会迷路。”师傅这么告诉他，“从这里到君临有好长一段路要飞，有无数老鹰伺机拦截，信不一定能传到他们手中。”然而对布兰而言，他们好像都已在他沉睡时死去……或者说死的是布兰，而他们已然将他遗忘。乔里、罗德利克爵士、维扬•普尔、胡伦、哈尔温，胖汤姆以及四分之一的守卫也都走了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2121');"><p>Only Robb and baby Rickon were still here, and Robb was changed. He was Robb the Lord now, or trying to be. He wore a real sword and never smiled. His days were spent drilling the guard and practicing his swordplay, making the yard ring with the sound of steel as Bran watched forlornly from his window. At night he closeted himself with Maester Luwin, talking or going over account books. Sometimes he would ride out with Hallis Mollen and be gone for days at a time, visiting distant holdfasts. Whenever he was away more than a day, Rickon would cry and ask Bran if Robb was ever coming back. Even when he was home at Winterfell, Robb the Lord seemed to have more time for Hallis Mollen and Theon Greyjoy than he ever did for his brothers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2121" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>只有罗柏和小瑞肯留下来，但罗柏也变了个人。现在的罗柏是一城之主，至少他正朝这个目辬努力。他佩上一把真正的剑，从来不笑。白天他把时间都花在操演士兵和练习剑术上，金铁交击声充斥校场，布兰却只能孤独地坐在窗台边观看；到了晚上，罗柏把自己和鲁温师傅锁在房里，交换意见或讨论账目。有时他会和哈里斯•莫兰骑马出巡，一去就是好几天。而只要他外出超过一日，瑞肯便会哭着追问布兰罗柏还会不会回来。其实就算待在临冬城，罗柏城主也都和哈里斯•莫兰与席恩•葛雷乔伊待在一块，没时间陪两个弟弟。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2122');"><p>"I could tell you the story about Brandon the Builder," Old Nan said. "That was always your favorite."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2122" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我来说说筑城者布兰登的故事吧，”老奶妈说，“你最喜欢这个故事了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2123');"><p>Thousands and thousands of years ago, Brandon the Builder had raised Winterfell, and some said the Wall. Bran knew the story, but it had never been his favorite. Maybe one of the other Brandons had liked that story. Sometimes Nan would talk to him as if he were her Brandon, the baby she had nursed all those years ago, and sometimes she confused him with his uncle Brandon, who was killed by the Mad King before Bran was even born. She had lived so long, Mother had told him once, that all the Brandon Starks had become one person in her head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2123" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>几千年以前，筑城者布兰登兴建了临冬城，有人说绝境长城也是他建造的。布兰知道这个故事，但他并不特别喜欢。喜欢这个故事的，或许是另一个叫布兰登的孩子。有时老奶妈会误以为他是许多年以前她养大的那个布兰登，有时又会把他和布兰登伯伯混为一人，而伯伯早在他出生以前就被疯王所害。她活了这么多年，母亲曾对他说，以至于所有叫布兰登•史塔克的人在她脑子里都变成了同一个。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2124');"><p>"That’s not my favorite," he said. "My favorites were the scary ones." He heard some sort of commotion outside and turned back to the window. Rickon was running across the yard toward the gatehouse, the wolves following him, but the tower faced the wrong way for Bran to see what was happening. He smashed a fist on his thigh in frustration and felt nothing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2124" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我最喜欢的才不是这个，”他说，“我喜欢的是那些吓人的。”他听见外面传来一阵骚动，转身望向窗外。瑞肯正穿过广场，朝城门楼跑去，狼群跟在后面。然而布兰所处的高塔方向不对，看不到究竟发生了什么。他不由得恼怒地一拳捶在大腿上，却毫无感觉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2125');"><p>"Oh, my sweet summer child," Old Nan said quietly, "what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2125" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“噢，我亲爱的孩子啊，你出生在夏季，”老奶妈静静地说，“你哪里懂得真正的恐惧？小少爷，当冬天来临，积雪百尺，冰风狂啸，那才是真正的恐怖。当长夜漫漫，终年不见天日，小孩在黑夜里诞生、在黑夜里长大、在黑夜里死亡，而冰原狼骨瘦嶙峋，白鬼穿梭林间，那才是恐惧降临之时。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2126');"><p>"You mean the Others," Bran said querulously.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2126" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说的是异鬼罢。”布兰暴躁地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2127');"><p>"The Others," Old Nan agreed. "Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a night that lasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks." Her voice and her needles fell silent, and she glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and asked, "So, child. This is the sort of story you like?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2127" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是啊，”老奶妈同意，“几千年前，一个出奇寒冷严酷的漫长冬季降临人间，只是今天的人类不复记忆。在一个长达整整一代人的长夜里，城中的国王和圈里的猪倌同样颤抖着死去。母亲们宁可闷死自己的孩子，也不愿见他们挨饿受冻。她们放声大哭，眼泪却冻结在脸颊上。”话音和织针同时静止，她抬起头，用那双惨白，像是覆盖了一层薄膜的眼睛看着布兰，问道：“孩子，你喜欢听的就是这种故事？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2128');"><p>"Well," Bran said reluctantly, "yes, only?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2128" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯，”布兰很不情愿地说，“是啊，不过……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2129');"><p>Old Nan nodded. "In that darkness, the Others came for the first time," she said as her needles went click click click. "They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2129" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老奶妈点点头。“在一片黑暗中，异鬼降临人间，”她一边说，手中针线一边作响，咯，咯，咯。“他们是冰冷与死亡的怪兽，痛恨钢铁、烈火和阳光，以及所有流淌着温热血液的生命。他们骑着苍白的死马，率领死人组成的军队，横扫农村、城市和王国，杀死成千上万的英雄和士兵。人类的剑无法阻止他们前进，老幼妇孺也难逃魔掌。他们在结冰的森林里追捕少女，用人类婴儿的肉来饲养手下的死灵仆役。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2130');"><p>Her voice had dropped very low, almost to a whisper, and Bran found himself leaning forward to listen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2130" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>此时她的声音已经降得极低，几乎像是呓语，布兰不自觉地倾身向前。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2131');"><p>"Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2131" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当时安达尔人还未统治七国，更是早在女人从洛恩河畔的古城邦渡狭海逃亡而来以前。只有先民从森林之子手中夺得土地，建立了林立四方的数百邦国。但在浓密的森林深处，森林之子依旧蛰居在他们的树上城镇和空山幽谷里。所以当大地充斥寒冷与死亡时，最后的英雄决定去寻找这些森林的儿女，冀望他们的远古魔法能抵挡人类所无法抵挡的军队。他佩上宝剑，骑乘骏马，带着猎犬，与一群同伴朝荒原启程。经过多年的长途跋舒，苦苦追寻，他始终找不到藏身秘密城市的森林之子，最后他绝望了。他的朋友相继罹难，他的战马和爱犬也先后死去，就连他的宝剑也被冻结成冰，一触即碎。这时，异鬼嗅到他体内温热的血液，悄悄地追踪他的足迹，带了一群大如猎狗的白蜘蛛偷袭——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2132');"><p>The door opened with a bang, and Bran’s heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear, but it was only Maester Luwin, with Hodor looming in the stairway behind him. "Hodor!" the stableboy announced, as was his custom, smiling hugely at them all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2132" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>房门“砰”地一声打开，把布兰吓得心脏都快从嘴里跳将出来。但进来的人不过是鲁温师傅，阿多站在他身后的楼梯间。“阿多！”马僮叫道，这是他的习惯，他还咧嘴朝大家微笑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2133');"><p>Maester Luwin was not smiling. "We have visitors," he announced, "and your presence is required, Bran."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2133" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温师傅没笑。“我们有访客。”他宣布，“而你必须出席，布兰。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2134');"><p>"I’m listening to a story now," Bran complained.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2134" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我正听故事哪。”布兰抱怨。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2135');"><p>"Stories wait, my little lord, and when you come back to them, why, there they are," Old Nan said. "Visitors are not so patient, and ofttimes they bring stories of their own."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2135" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小少爷，故事可以等下再听，待会儿您回来的时候，呵，它们都好端端地等着你呢。”老奶妈说，“客人可没这么有耐心哟，而且啊，他们常会带来自己的故事呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2136');"><p>"Who is it?" Bran asked Maester Luwin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2136" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是谁啊？”布兰问鲁温师傅。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2137');"><p>"Tyrion Lannister, and some men of the Night’s Watch, with word from your brother Jon. Robb is meeting with them now. Hodor, will you help Bran down to the hall?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2137" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“提利昂•兰尼斯特，还有几位守夜人弟兄，说是有你哥哥琼恩的口信。罗柏正在会见他们。阿多，请你帮忙把布兰带到大厅去吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2138');"><p>"Hodor!" Hodor agreed happily. He ducked to get his great shaggy head under the door. Hodor was nearly seven feet tall. It was hard to believe that he was the same blood as Old Nan. Bran wondered if he would shrivel up as small as his great-grandmother when he was old. It did not seem likely, even if Hodor lived to be a thousand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2138" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“阿多！”阿多开心地同意。他弯身让他那颗毛茸茸的大头穿过门。阿多高近七尺，很难相信他竟是老奶妈的后代。布兰暗自猜想，不知他年老时，会不会跟他曾祖母一样缩成那么一团。只怕阿多就算活个一千年，这也不大可能。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2139');"><p>Hodor lifted Bran as easy as if he were a bale of hay, and cradled him against his massive chest. He always smelled faintly of horses, but it was not a bad smell. His arms were thick with muscle and matted with brown hair. "Hodor," he said again. Theon Greyjoy had once commented that Hodor did not know much, but no one could doubt that he knew his name. Old Nan had cackled like a hen when Bran told her that, and confessed that Hodor’s real name was Walder. No one knew where "Hodor" had come from, she said, but when he started saying it, they started calling him by it. It was the only word he had.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2139" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>阿多像举稻草一样轻易地举起布兰，抱在胸前。他身上总有股淡淡的马臊味，好在还可以忍受。他的双臂肌肉虬张，长满褐色体毛。“阿多。”他又说了一次。席恩•葛雷乔伊曾评论说阿多虽然所知有限，但谁也不能怀疑他知道自己的名字。布兰把这件事告诉老奶妈，她像只母鸡般咯咯直笑，并偷偷告诉他阿多的本名是瓦德。没人知道“阿多”这名字是打哪儿来的，她说，但当他开始说这个词的时候，大家就如此称呼他了。这是他惟一会说的词。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2140');"><p>They left Old Nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories. Hodor hummed tunelessly as he carried Bran down the steps and through the gallery, with Maester Luwin following behind, hurrying to keep up with the stableboy’s long strides.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2140" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是他们离开高塔房间里的老奶妈，把她留给针线活和回忆。阿多不成调地哼歌，抱着布兰步下阶梯，穿过走廊。鲁温师傅跟在后面，加快脚步以跟上马夫的宽大步幅。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2141');"><p>Robb was seated in Father’s high seat, wearing ringmail and boiled leather and the stern face of Robb the Lord. Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen stood behind him. A dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone walls beneath tall narrow windows. In the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants, and four strangers in the black of the Night’s Watch. Bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that Hodor carried him through the doors.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2141" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏正坐在父亲的高位上，穿着环甲和硬皮衣，一脸罗柏城主的严峻表情。席恩•葛雷乔伊和哈里斯•莫兰站在他身后。十来个守卫一字排开，紧靠灰石墙，站在高高的窄窗下。大厅的正中央则站着侏儒和他的仆从，还有四个身着守夜人黑衣的陌生人。阿多刚抱着他踏进门，布兰就感觉房里弥漫着一股怒气。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2142');"><p>"Any man of the Night’s Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay," Robb was saying with the voice of Robb the Lord. His sword was across his knees, the steel bare for all the world to see. Even Bran knew what it meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2142" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“只要是守夜人的弟兄，我们都欢迎，各位在临冬城想住多久就住多久。”罗柏用城主罗柏的声音说。他的佩剑横放在膝上，让大家都能看见。即便布兰也知道摆着出鞘的武器待客是什么道理。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2143');"><p>"Any man of the Night’s Watch," the dwarf repeated, "but not me, do I take your meaning, boy?"

Bran cried out and clung for dear life. The earth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly. He could not fly. He waited until his heart had stopped pounding, until he could breathe, and he began to climb again. There was no way to go but up. Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles. His arms were sore and aching, but he dared not rest. He forced himself to climb faster. The gargoyles watched him ascend. Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier. Perhaps once they had been lions, but now they were twisted and grotesque. Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear. He must not listen, he told himself, he must not hear, so long as he did not hear them he was safe. But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung, he knew he was not safe after all.

He was afraid for a moment, until he remembered how that story ended. "The children will help him," he blurted, "the children of the forest!"

His brother was strong for his age, and Bran was as light as a bundle of rags, but the stairs were steep and dark, and Robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2202');"><p>He put Bran into bed, covered him with blankets, and blew out the candle. For a time Robb sat beside him in the dark. Bran wanted to talk to him, but he did not know what to say. "We’ll find a horse for you, I promise," Robb whispered at last.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2202" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他把布兰放上床，为他盖上毯子，然后吹熄蜡烛。罗柏在黑暗中陪他坐了一会儿。布兰想跟他聊聊，却不知该说些什么。“我保证，一定会帮你找到合适的马。”最后罗柏低声说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2203');"><p>"Are they ever coming back?" Bran asked him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2203" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“爸妈他们会回来吗？”布兰问他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2204');"><p>"Yes," Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just Robb the Lord. "Mother will be home soon. Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes. Wouldn’t that surprise her, to see you ahorse?" Even in the dark room, Bran could feel his brother’s smile. "And afterward, we’ll ride north to see the Wall. We won’t even tell Jon we’re coming, we’ll just be there one day, you and me. It will be an adventure."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2204" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然会。”罗柏的语气充满希望，布兰知道此刻和自己说话的是罗柏哥哥，而非罗柏城主。 “母亲很快就会回来了。说不定我们可以一起骑马出城去迎接她哟。看到你骑在马上的英姿，她一定又惊又喜，对不对？”即使房间漆黑一团，布兰也能感觉哥哥的微笑。“然后咱俩可以往北骑，去看看长城。咱们先瞒着琼恩，你我两个哪天说走就走，跟出去冒险一样。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2205');"><p>"An adventure," Bran repeated wistfully. He heard his brother sob. The room was so dark he could not see the tears on Robb’s face, so he reached out and found his hand. Their fingers twined together.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2205" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“出去冒险。”布兰渴望地复诵。他听见哥哥轻声啜泣。屋里太暗，看不到罗柏脸上的泪水，所以他伸出手找到哥哥的手，十根指头紧紧交握。
