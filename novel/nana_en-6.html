</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1089');"><p>Count Muffat, accompanied by his wife and daughter, had arrived overnight at Les Fondettes, where Mme Hugon, who was staying there with only her son Georges, had invited them to come and spend a week. The house, which had been built at the end of the eighteenth century, stood in the middle of a huge square enclosure. It was perfectly unadorned, but the garden possessed magnificent shady trees and a chain of tanks fed by running spring water. It stood at the side of the road which leads from Orleans to Paris and with its rich verdure and high-embowered trees broke the monotony of that flat countryside, where fields stretched to the horizon's verge.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1089" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>昨天晚上，缪法伯爵偕同妻子和女儿，来到了丰岱特庄园，呆在庄园里的只有于贡夫人和她的儿子乔治，她邀请他们到庄园来住一个星期。他们的房屋是十七世纪末建造的，四周是方方正正的大围墙，房子外观朴实无华；但花园里却绿树成荫，几口池塘里的水都是流水，从山泉流来。庄园坐落在由奥尔良通往巴黎的公路旁边，树木葱葱绿绿，宛如一片碧浪，打破了这个平原地区的一望无垠的农田的单调景色。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1090');"><p>At eleven o'clock, when the second lunch bell had called the whole household together, Mme Hugon, smiling in her kindly maternal way, gave Sabine two great kisses, one on each cheek, and said as she did so:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1090" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>十一点钟，午饭的钟声敲响第二下时，大家便聚集到一起，于贡夫人脸上浮现出慈母般的微笑，在萨比娜的脸颊上吻了两下，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1091');"><p>"You know it's my custom in the country. Oh, seeing you here makes me feel twenty years younger. Did you sleep well in your old room?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1091" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你知道，我住在乡下已经习惯了……看见你来了，我仿佛年轻了二十岁……在你以前住过的房间里，这一夜，睡得好吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1092');"><p>Then without waiting for her reply she turned to Estelle:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1092" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，还未等到萨比娜回答，她又转向爱丝泰勒，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1093');"><p>"And this little one, has she had a nap too? Give me a kiss, my child."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1093" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这个小姑娘也是一觉睡到天亮吧？……来吻我一下吧，我的孩子……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1094');"><p>They had taken their seats in the vast dining room, the windows of which looked out on the park. But they only occupied one end of the long table, where they sat somewhat crowded together for company's sake. Sabine, in high good spirits, dwelt on various childish memories which had been stirred up within her—memories of months passed at Les Fondettes, of long walks, of a tumble into one of the tanks on a summer evening, of an old romance of chivalry discovered by her on the top of a cupboard and read during the winter before fires made of vine branches. And Georges, who had not seen the countess for some months, thought there was something curious about her. Her face seemed changed, somehow, while, on the other hand, that stick of an Estelle seemed more insignificant and dumb and awkward than ever.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1094" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大家已经在一间宽敞的饭厅里坐了下来，饭厅窗户都朝向花园。大家坐在大餐桌的一头，互相靠得很紧，这样显得更亲热些。萨比娜兴高采烈，此时此地唤起了她对年轻时代的回忆：她曾经在丰岱特住过几个月，在这里作过长距离的散步，夏天的一个夜晚，不小心掉进一口池塘里，在一个衣柜里发现一本旧骑士小说，冬天她坐在葡萄枝点燃的火堆前读这本小说。乔治已有几个月没有看见伯爵夫人了，他觉得她有些古怪，容貌似乎有些变化；相反，这根瘦竹杆子爱丝泰勒，却显得更加平平常常，沉默寡言，呆板得很。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1095');"><p>While such simple fare as cutlets and boiled eggs was being discussed by the company, Mme Hugon, as became a good housekeeper, launched out into complaints. The butchers, she said, were becoming impossible. She bought everything at Orleans, and yet they never brought her the pieces she asked for. Yet, alas, if her guests had nothing worth eating it was their own fault: they had come too late in the season.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1095" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大家吃得很简单，只吃了带壳煮的溏心蛋和排骨。于贡夫人是个家庭妇女，她抱怨肉店真不像话，送来的肉从来没有一块是合她意的，她只好一切都到奥尔良去买。另外，这次客人们吃得不满意，要怪他们自己，因为他们姗姗来迟，错过了时节。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1096');"><p>"There's no sense in it," she said. "I've been expecting you since June, and now we're half through September. You see, it doesn't look pretty."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1096" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们真没有常识，”她说道，“我从六月份起就一直盼望你们来，眼下已到了九月中旬……所以，你们瞧，没有什么景色可欣赏了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1097');"><p>And with a movement she pointed to the trees on the grass outside, the leaves of which were beginning to turn yellow. The day was covered, and the distance was hidden by a bluish haze which was fraught with a sweet and melancholy peacefulness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1097" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她用手指指了指外面已经开始发黄的草地里的树木。天空阴沉沉的，远处笼罩在一片淡蓝色的雾气中，一派恬静、寂静景色，令人惆怅。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1098');"><p>"Oh, I'm expecting company," she continued. "We shall be gayer then! The first to come will be two gentlemen whom Georges has invited—Monsieur Fauchery and Monsieur Daguenet; you know them, do you not? Then we shall have Monsieur de Vandeuvres, who has promised me a visit these five years past. This time, perhaps, he'll make up his mind!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1098" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！我还要等几个客人，”她继续说道，“客人来了我们就快乐起来……乔治邀请的客人首先是福什利先生和达盖内先生，你们大概认识他们吧？……还有德旺德夫尔先生，他在五年前就答应我要来的；今年他也许会下决心来吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1099');"><p>"Oh, well and good!" said the countess, laughing. "If we only can get Monsieur de Vandeuvres! But he's too much engaged."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1099" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好啊！”伯爵夫人笑着说，“那怕只邀请到旺德夫尔一个人也好！他非常忙。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1100');"><p>"And Philippe?" queried Muffat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1100" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“菲利普呢？”缪法问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1101');"><p>"Philippe has asked for a furlough," replied the old lady, "but without doubt you won't be at Les Fondettes any longer when he arrives."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1101" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“菲利普请过假了，”老太太回答道，“等他回来时，你们也许不在丰岱特了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1102');"><p>The coffee was served. Paris was now the subject of conversation, and Steiner's name was mentioned, at which Mme Hugon gave a little cry.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1102" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>咖啡端来了。大家一下子又谈到巴黎，有人提到斯泰内的名字。听到这个名字，于贡夫人轻轻叫了一声。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1103');"><p>"Let me see," she said; "Monsieur Steiner is that stout man I met at your house one evening. He's a banker, is he not? Now there's a detestable man for you! Why, he's gone and bought an actress an estate about a league from here, over Gumieres way, beyond the Choue. The whole countryside's scandalized. Did you know about that, my friend?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1103" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“顺便问一下，”她说道，“斯泰内先生，是不是就是一天晚上我在你家里遇到的那个胖子，是个银行家？……这个人真不光彩！他在离这里一里远的地方，为一个女演员买了一座别墅，就在舒河后面，靠近居米埃尔那里！这个地方的人对他都很反感……我的朋友，你知道这件事吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1104');"><p>"I knew nothing about it," replied Muffat. "Ah, then, Steiner's bought a country place in the neighborhood!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1104" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我一点也不知道，”缪法回答道，“哦，斯泰内在附近买了一座别墅！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1105');"><p>Hearing his mother broach the subject, Georges looked into his coffee cup, but in his astonishment at the count's answer he glanced up at him and stared. Why was he lying so glibly? The count, on his side, noticed the young fellow's movement and gave him a suspicious glance. Mme Hugon continued to go into details: the country place was called La Mignotte. In order to get there one had to go up the bank of the Choue as far as Gumieres in order to cross the bridge; otherwise one got one's feet wet and ran the risk of a ducking.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1105" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔治听到她母亲提起这件事时，正在低头喝咖啡；他抬起头来，瞧瞧伯爵，对他的回答感到很惊讶。他为什么这样公然撒谎？而伯爵呢，他也注意到了年轻人的动作，他以怀疑的目光瞧了他一下。于贡夫人继续说得更详细了：这座别墅取名“藏娇楼”，沿舒河而上，一直到居米埃尔，再过一座桥，就到了。这样走，整整多走二公里；不然，就要涉水过河，要冒落水的危险。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1106');"><p>"And what is the actress's name?" asked the countess.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1106" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那个女演员叫什么名字？”伯爵夫人问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1107');"><p>"Oh, I wasn't told," murmured the old lady. "Georges, you were there the morning the gardener spoke to us about it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1107" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！对了，有人向我提到过她，”老太太喃喃说道，“今天早上园丁告诉我们的时候，乔治，你也在场……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1108');"><p>Georges appeared to rack his brains. Muffat waited, twirling a teaspoon between his fingers. Then the countess addressed her husband:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1108" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔治装出记不清楚的样子。缪法一边用手指转动着一把汤匙，一边等待乔治回答。伯爵夫人对她丈夫说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1109');"><p>"Isn't Monsieur Steiner with that singer at the Varietes, that Nana?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1109" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“斯泰内先生是否就是那个与游艺剧院的女歌星娜娜相好的人？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1110');"><p>"Nana, that's the name! A horrible woman!" cried Mme Hugon with growing annoyance. "And they are expecting her at La Mignotte. I've heard all about it from the gardener. Didn't the gardener say they were expecting her this evening, Georges?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1110" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“娜娜，正是她，真讨厌！”于贡夫人气愤地说道，“有人在‘藏娇楼’里等她来呢。这些情况都是园丁告诉我的……你说是吗，乔治？园丁说她今天晚上就来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1111');"><p>The count gave a little start of astonishment, but Georges replied with much vivacity:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1111" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵惊讶得身上轻轻打了一下哆嗦，乔治抢先说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1112');"><p>"Oh, Mother, the gardener spoke without knowing anything about it. Directly afterward the coachman said just the opposite. Nobody's expected at La Mignotte before the day after tomorrow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1112" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哦，妈妈，园丁不了解情况……刚才车夫说的情况正好相反，后天之前不会有任何人来‘藏娇楼’。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1113');"><p>He tried hard to assume a natural expression while he slyly watched the effect of his remarks on the count. The latter was twirling his spoon again as though reassured. The countess, her eyes fixed dreamily on the blue distances of the park, seemed to have lost all interest in the conversation. The shadow of a smile on her lips, she seemed to be following up a secret thought which had been suddenly awakened within her. Estelle, on the other hand, sitting stiffly on her chair, had heard all that had been said about Nana, but her white, virginal face had not betrayed a trace of emotion.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1113" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔治竭力做出神态自然的样子，一边用眼角观察伯爵对他的话的反应。伯爵这时又转动起小汤匙来，看样子他放心了。伯爵夫人目不转睛地凝望着远处花园的淡蓝色薄雾，似乎不再听他们谈话。随着脸上浮现的一丝微笑，她的思路跟着突然唤起的秘密想法转动；这时爱丝泰勒直挺挺地坐在椅子上，听了大家谈到娜娜的情况，她的白皙的处女脸上，没有丝毫反应。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1114');"><p>"Dear me, dear me! I've got no right to grow angry," murmured Mme Hugon after a pause, and with a return to her old good humor she added:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1114" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的天，”于贡太太沉默了一会，恢复了她纯朴善良的脾气，悄悄说道，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1115');"><p>"Everybody's got a right to live. If we meet this said lady on the road we shall not bow to her—that's all!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1115" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不该生气……每个人都要活下去嘛……这个女人，如果我们在路上遇到她，不同她打招呼就行了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1116');"><p>And as they got up from table she once more gently upbraided the Countess Sabine for having been so long in coming to her that year. But the countess defended herself and threw the blame of the delays upon her husband's shoulders. Twice on the eve of departure, when all the trunks were locked, he counterordered their journey on the plea of urgent business. Then he had suddenly decided to start just when the trip seemed shelved. Thereupon the old lady told them how Georges in the same way had twice announced his arrival without arriving and had finally cropped up at Les Fondettes the day before yesterday, when she was no longer expecting him. They had come down into the garden, and the two men, walking beside the ladies, were listening to them in consequential silence.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1116" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大家散席时，她还埋怨萨比娜伯爵夫人今年不该让她等得那么久。但是伯爵夫人为自己辩护，她把来迟的责任推到她丈夫的身上；有两次连箱子都收拾好了，临走前他又变挂了，说有紧急事情要处理；后来，看来旅行计划完全告吹了，他却又突然决定来了。于是，老太太又说，乔治也一样，两次说要来，结果都没有来，后来她已不指望他来了，结果他却在前天晚上突然来到了丰岱特。大家走向花园，两个女人走在中间，两个男人走在左右两边，他们低着头，静静地听她们讲话。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1117');"><p>"Never mind," said Mme Hugon, kissing her son's sunny locks, "Zizi is a very good boy to come and bury himself in the country with his mother. He's a dear Zizi not to forget me!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1117" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不过这也不要紧，”于贡太太说，她在她儿子的金色头发上吻了吻，“小治治真乖，这次他肯来到这个偏僻的乡间，同妈妈在一起……这个好治治，他还没有忘记我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1118');"><p>In the afternoon she expressed some anxiety, for Georges, directly after leaving the table, had complained of a heavy feeling in his head and now seemed in for an atrocious sick headache. Toward four o'clock he said he would go upstairs to bed: it was the only remedy. After sleeping till tomorrow morning he would be perfectly himself again. His mother was bent on putting him to bed herself, but as she left the room he ran and locked the door, explaining that he was shutting himself in so that no one should come and disturb him. Then caressingly he shouted, "Good night till tomorrow, little Mother!" and promised to take a nap. But he did not go to bed again and with flushed cheeks and bright eyes noiselessly put on his clothes. Then he sat on a chair and waited. When the dinner bell rang he listened for Count Muffat, who was on his way to the dining room, and ten minutes later, when he was certain that no one would see him, he slipped from the window to the ground with the assistance of a rain pipe. His bedroom was situated on the first floor and looked out upon the rear of the house. He threw himself among some bushes and got out of the park and then galloped across the fields with empty stomach and heart beating with excitement. Night was closing in, and a small fine rain was beginning to fall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1118" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>下午，她感到焦虑不安，乔治刚刚离席时，就说头脑发沉，似乎慢慢地变成剧烈的偏头痛。快到四点钟时，他就想上楼睡觉，这是唯一的治疗方法；只要他一觉睡到第二天早上，就什么病也没有了。他母亲坚持要亲自送他上床睡觉。但她一出了房间，乔治就从床上跳下来，把门反锁上了，他借口说把自己反锁在房间里，免得别人来打扰他；然后，他亲热地叫道：“晚安，妈妈，明天见！”同时他答应一觉睡到大天亮。事实上，他下床后没有再躺下，脸上毫无病容，目光炯炯，他悄悄地穿上衣服，然后，坐到一张椅子上，一动不动，静静地等待着。晚饭钟声敲响时，他窥伺着向饭厅走去的缪法。十分钟后，他觉得肯定不会被人看见了，就敏捷地爬上窗户，抓住一条下水管溜到室外；他的卧室在二楼，窗户朝向房子的背面。他钻进一片树丛中，出了花园，在田野上奔跑，向着舒河方向而去，他的肚子里空空的，激动得心怦怦直跳。夜幕降临了，开始下起毛毛细雨。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1119');"><p>It was the very evening that Nana was due at La Mignotte. Ever since in the preceding May Steiner had bought her this country place she had from time to time been so filled with the desire of taking possession that she had wept hot tears about, but on each of these occasions Bordenave had refused to give her even the shortest leave and had deferred her holiday till September on the plea that he did not intend putting an understudy in her place, even for one evening, now that the exhibition was on. Toward the close of August he spoke of October. Nana was furious and declared that she would be at La Mignotte in the middle of September. Nay, in order to dare Bordenave, she even invited a crowd of guests in his very presence. One afternoon in her rooms, as Muffat, whose advances she still adroitly resisted, was beseeching her with tremulous emotion to yield to his entreaties, she at length promised to be kind, but not in Paris, and to him, too, she named the middle of September. Then on the twelfth she was seized by a desire to be off forthwith with Zoe as her sole companion. It might be that Bordenave had got wind of her intentions and was about to discover some means of detaining her. She was delighted at the notion of putting him in a fix, and she sent him a doctor's certificate. When once the idea had entered her head of being the first to get to La Mignotte and of living there two days without anybody knowing anything about it, she rushed Zoe through the operation of packing and finally pushed her into a cab, where in a sudden burst of extreme contrition she kissed her and begged her pardon. It was only when they got to the station refreshment room that she thought of writing Steiner of her movements. She begged him to wait till the day after tomorrow before rejoining her if he wanted to find her quite bright and fresh. And then, suddenly conceiving another project, she wrote a second letter, in which she besought her aunt to bring little Louis to her at once. It would do Baby so much good! And how happy they would be together in the shade of the trees! In the railway carriage between Paris and Orleans she spoke of nothing else; her eyes were full of tears; she had an unexpected attack of maternal tenderness and mingled together flowers, birds and child in her every sentence.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1119" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这天晚上，娜娜确实要到“藏娇楼”来。自从五月份斯泰内给她买下这座别墅以来，她不时想到这里来居住，为这事她还流过泪呢；可是，每次她要来，博尔德纳夫总是连最短时间的假也不批准，说要到九月份才能让她走，借口在博览会期间，他不想找别人来代她演出，那怕一个晚上也不行。快到八月底时，他又说要等到十月份才行。娜娜恼火了，宣称九月十五日她要到“藏娇楼”来。她甚至跟博尔德纳夫对着干，当着他的面，邀请一大群人同往。她一直巧妙地拒绝缪法对她的追求，一天下午，他在她家里，浑身哆嗦着苦苦哀求她，她终于答应了他的要求，但是要她去了“藏娇楼”才行；她也要求他在九月十五日到那里。到了十二日，她心血来潮，突然一个人带着佐爱走了。如果博尔德纳夫事先知道了，也许会想出办法不让她走。她给博尔德纳夫捎去医生开的一张证明，把他扔下不管，这样做她觉得非常开心。她第一个到达“藏娇楼”，神不知鬼不觉地在那里住上两天的想法在她头脑里产生时，她便催促佐爱收拾行李，把她推上出租马车。在马车里，她对佐爱非常亲热，一边请求她原谅，一边吻她。一直到了火车站的小吃部，她才想到要写一封信通知斯泰内。她请斯泰内在大后天与她见面，如果他希望他们见面时她精神充沛的话。接着，她的头脑里又突然出现另一个想法，她又写了一封信给她的姑妈，请她立刻把小路易带来。这样对小宝宝非常有好处，大家在树荫下一起玩玩，该多好啊！从巴黎到奥尔良，她在车厢里一直谈着这件事，谈着谈着，她的眼睛都流泪了，突然大发母爱之情，竟把花呀、鸟呀和她的孩子夹在一起大谈特谈。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1120');"><p>La Mignotte was more than three leagues away from the station, and Nana lost a good hour over the hire of a carriage, a huge, dilapidated calash, which rumbled slowly along to an accompaniment of rattling old iron. She had at once taken possession of the coachman, a little taciturn old man whom she overwhelmed with questions. Had he often passed by La Mignotte? It was behind this hill then? There ought to be lots of trees there, eh? And the house could one see it at a distance? The little old man answered with a succession of grunts. Down in the calash Nana was almost dancing with impatience, while Zoe, in her annoyance at having left Paris in such a hurry, sat stiffly sulking beside her. The horse suddenly stopped short, and the young woman thought they had reached their destination. She put her head out of the carriage door and asked:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1120" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“藏娇楼”别墅距火车站三法里有余。娜娜花了一个小时才雇到一辆马车，那是一辆破旧的敞篷四轮马车，车速很慢，车轮发出哐当哐当的声音。车夫是个不爱言谈的矮个子老头，她马上缠着他，向他提出一连串问题。例如：他是否经常在“藏娇楼”别墅前经过？“藏娇楼”是否就在这座小山岗的后面？那儿是否树木很多？那座房子是否在老远的地方就能望见？矮老头子被问得支支吾吾。娜娜坐在马车里，高兴得坐立不安；而佐爱则不然，还在为匆匆忙忙地离开巴黎而怄气呢，她直撅撅地坐在里面，面色阴郁。马突然停步了，娜娜以为到了目的地。她把头探到车门外，问道：

"As for me, I knew the country only too well when I was with my dentist. He had a house at Bougival. No, it's cold, too, this evening. It's damp in these parts."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1124" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“人家一看太太就知道不是乡下人，”女仆绷着脸终于开口了，“我呀，我对农村倒很熟悉，我在一个牙科医生家里干过活，他在布吉瓦尔有一座房屋……所以，我知道今天晚上一定很冷，这一带天气很潮湿。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1125');"><p>They were driving under the shadow of a wood, and Nana sniffed up the scent of the leaves as a young dog might. All of a sudden at a turn of the road she caught sight of the corner of a house among the trees. Perhaps it was there! And with that she began a conversation with the driver, who continued shaking his head by way of saying no. Then as they drove down the other side of the hill he contented himself by holding out his whip and muttering, "'Tis down there."

A side door was opened, and the gardener, a tall, dry fellow, made his appearance, cap in hand. Nana made an effort to regain her dignity, for the driver seemed now to be suppressing a laugh behind his dry, speechless lips. She refrained from setting off at a run and listened to the gardener, who was a very talkative fellow. He begged Madame to excuse the disorder in which she found everything, seeing that he had only received Madame's letter that very morning. But despite all his efforts, she flew off at a tangent and walked so quickly that Zoe could scarcely follow her. At the end of the avenue she paused for a moment in order to take the house in at a glance. It was a great pavilion-like building in the Italian manner, and it was flanked by a smaller construction, which a rich Englishman, after two years' residence in Naples, had caused to be erected and had forthwith become disgusted with.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1130" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>马车在栅栏前面停了下来。一扇小门打开了，走出一个瘦高个子园丁，手里拿着一顶鸭舌帽。娜娜又摆出一副尊严的样子，因为车夫虽然紧闭嘴不说话，但样子却像在暗暗发笑。她克制住自己，没有向里面跑，站在那儿听车夫讲话。园丁是个爱唠叨的人，他请太太原谅那里没有收拾整齐，因为他早上刚刚收到太太的信。娜娜虽然尽量克制自己，还是拔腿就走，她走得很快，佐爱赶不上她。走到小路的一头，她停下脚步，站了片刻，把整座房子看了一眼。这是一座颇具意大利风格的大别墅，旁边有一座较小的房屋，是一个英国富翁在那不勒斯居住两年后，到这里建造的；建后不久他就住厌了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1131');"><p>"I'll take Madame over the house," said the gardener.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1132');"><p>But she had outrun him entirely, and she shouted back that he was not to put himself out and that she would go over the house by herself. She preferred doing that, she said. And without removing her hat she dashed into the different rooms, calling to Zoe as she did so, shouting her impressions from one end of each corridor to the other and filling the empty house, which for long months had been uninhabited, with exclamations and bursts of laughter. In the first place, there was the hall. It was a little damp, but that didn't matter; one wasn't going to sleep in it. Then came the drawing room, quite the thing, the drawing room, with its windows opening on the lawn. Only the red upholsteries there were hideous; she would alter all that. As to the dining room-well, it was a lovely dining room, eh? What big blowouts you might give in Paris if you had a dining room as large as that! As she was going upstairs to the first floor it occurred to her that she had not seen the kitchen, and she went down again and indulged in ecstatic exclamations. Zoe ought to admire the beautiful dimensions of the sink and the width of the hearth, where you might have roasted a sheep! When she had gone upstairs again her bedroom especially enchanted her. It had been hung with delicate rose-colored Louis XVI cretonne by an Orleans upholsterer. Dear me, yes! One ought to sleep jolly sound in such a room as that; why, it was a real best bedroom! Then came four or five guest chambers and then some splendid garrets, which would be extremely convenient for trunks and boxes. Zoe looked very gruff and cast a frigid glance into each of the rooms as she lingered in Madame's wake. She saw Nana disappearing up the steep garret ladder and said, "Thanks, I haven't the least wish to break my legs." But the sound of a voice reached her from far away; indeed, it seemed to come whistling down a chimney.

On the roof she found her mistress leaning against the brickwork balustrade and gazing at the valley which spread out into the silence.

Nana had to hold her hat on with both hands to keep it from being blown away while her petticoats streamed out behind her, flapping like a flag.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1142');"><p>The lady's maid never budged an inch. Madame must really be raving mad. For now the rain was coming down in torrents, and the little white silk sunshade was already dark with it. Nor did it shelter Madame, whose skirts were wringing wet. But that didn't put her out in the smallest degree, and in the pouring rain she visited the kitchen garden and the orchard, stopping in front of every fruit tree and bending over every bed of vegetables. Then she ran and looked down the well and lifted up a frame to see what was underneath it and was lost in the contemplation of a huge pumpkin. She wanted to go along every single garden walk and to take immediate possession of all the things she had been wont to dream of in the old days, when she was a slipshod work-girl on the Paris pavements. The rain redoubled, but she never heeded it and was only miserable at the thought that the daylight was fading. She could not see clearly now and touched things with her fingers to find out what they were. Suddenly in the twilight she caught sight of a bed of strawberries, and all that was childish in her awoke.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1142" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>女仆听了一动也不动。太太大概看得着迷了。现在，下起滂沱大雨，那把白绸小阳伞已经完全变黑了；它遮盖不住娜娜，她的裙子上流着水。可是，这一切丝毫不影响她的兴致。她在滂沱大雨下观看菜园和果园，在每棵树前面都要停下来看看，在每一棵蔬菜前都要弯下腰来观察一下。接着，她跑到每口井边，望望井底，她又掀起一个木头架子，看看下面有什么东西，只见一只硕大无朋的南瓜，她出神地看了一会儿。她真想走遍每条小径，马上拥有这一切，而这一切正是她过去拖着破旧的女工鞋走在巴黎街道上时所梦寐以求的。雨下得越来越大了，但是她并没有感觉到，她遗憾的仅仅是天快黑下来了。现在她看不清楚了，就用手去摸，一定要弄清楚是什么东西。突然，在黄昏中，她辨认出草莓来，于是，她像孩子一样大声叫道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1143');"><p>"Strawberries! Strawberries! There are some here; I can feel them. A plate, Zoe! Come and pick strawberries."

Up till today she had always treated him like a naughty urchin, never taking his declarations seriously and amusing herself at his expense as though he were a little man of no consequence whatever. There was much ado to install him in the house. She absolutely insisted on the fire being lit in her bedroom, as being the most comfortable place for his reception. Georges had not surprised Zoe, who was used to all kinds of encounters, but the gardener, who brought the wood upstairs, was greatly nonplused at sight of this dripping gentleman to whom he was certain he had not opened the front door. He was, however, dismissed, as he was no longer wanted.

Then she turned him round as though he were a doll, gave him little thumps, made the skirt stand well out behind. After which she asked him questions. Was he comfortable? Did he feel warm? Zounds, yes, he was comfortable! Nothing fitted more closely and warmly than a woman's shift; had he been able, he would always have worn one. He moved round and about therein, delighted with the fine linen and the soft touch of that unmanly garment, in the folds of which he thought he discovered some of Nana's own warm life.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1164" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们三个人都乐开了怀。娜娜替他把晨衣的扣子从上到下都扣上，让他看上去显得端庄整齐。她把他当作洋娃娃转过来，转过去，在他身上拍拍打打，让裙子的后部鼓起来。接着，她又问他这样，问他那样，问他穿上这身衣服舒服不舒服，暖不暖和。当然罗，他觉得很舒服。穿什么也比不上穿女人的睡衣暖和，如果可能的话，他要永远穿着这身衣服。穿着这身衣服，他感到高兴的是，料子很细软，衣服很宽松，而且有一股香味，他似乎从衣服里找到了娜娜一点温暖的生命似的。

But she was as hungry as a hunter too. They certainly must feed! Only they would have to eat what they could get. Whereupon a round table was rolled up in front of the fire, and the queerest of dinners was improvised thereon. Zoe ran down to the gardener's, he having cooked a mess of cabbage soup in case Madame should not dine at Orleans before her arrival. Madame, indeed, had forgotten to tell him what he was to get ready in the letter she had sent him. Fortunately the cellar was well furnished. Accordingly they had cabbage soup, followed by a piece of bacon. Then Nana rummaged in her handbag and found quite a heap of provisions which she had taken the precaution of stuffing into it. There was a Strasbourg pate, for instance, and a bag of sweet-meats and some oranges. So they both ate away like ogres and, while they satisfied their healthy young appetites, treated one another with easy good fellowship. Nana kept calling Georges "dear old girl," a form of address which struck her as at once tender and familiar. At dessert, in order not to give Zoe any more trouble, they used the same spoon turn and turn about while demolishing a pot of preserves they had discovered at the top of a cupboard.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1167" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜听了生气了。真是个蠢孩子，空着肚子从妈妈家里溜出来，还掉在一个水潭里！可是她自己也饿得慌。当然应该吃饭！不过，只能有什么就吃什么。于是，他们把独脚小圆桌推到了火炉前面，临时凑合了一顿古怪可笑的晚饭。佐爱跑到园丁那里，园丁已经做好了白菜汤，准备给太太吃，如果她来这里之前，在奥尔良没有吃晚饭的话。太太在信里忘记告诉他应该准备些什么东西。幸亏地窖里有不少东西。他们有了白菜汤，加上一块肥肉。接着，娜娜又在她的包里找出了不少东西，那是她在临行前，考虑周全而塞进去的食品：一小听鹅肝酱，一袋糖果，几个橙子。他们两人狼吞虎咽地吃起来，胃口好得像是二十岁的年轻人，像朋友那样，无拘无束。娜娜叫乔治：“亲爱的小妞儿。”她觉得这样叫更亲昵，更温情。吃餐后点心时，为了不打扰佐爱，两人用同一把汤匙，轮流着吃，把在衣柜上找到的一罐果酱吃得精光。

But he kept declaring that he had plenty of time to spare.

After which they were alone in the silent house.

The fire was dying out amid glowing embers, and in the great blue room, where Zoe had made up the bed before going upstairs, the air felt a little oppressive.

The weather had undergone a brisk change: the skies were clearing, and a full moon lit up the country with its golden disk of light. A sovereign quiet reigned over the valley. It seemed wider and larger as it opened on the immense distances of the plain, where the trees loomed like little shadowy islands amid a shining and waveless lake. And Nana grew tenderhearted, felt herself a child again. Most surely she had dreamed of nights like this at an epoch which she could not recall. Since leaving the train every object of sensation—the wide countryside, the green things with their pungent scents, the house, the vegetables—had stirred her to such a degree that now it seemed to her as if she had left Paris twenty years ago. Yesterday's existence was far, far away, and she was full of sensations of which she had no previous experience. Georges, meanwhile, was giving her neck little coaxing kisses, and this again added to her sweet unrest. With hesitating hand she pushed him from her, as though he were a child whose affectionate advances were fatiguing, and once more she told him that he ought to take his departure. He did not gainsay her. All in good time—he would go all in good time!

Georges was the last to come downstairs. He was looking a little pale, and his eyes were sunken, but in answer to questions he said that he was much better, though he was still somewhat shaken by the violence of the attack. Mme Hugon looked into his eyes with an anxious smile and adjusted his hair which had been carelessly combed that morning, but he drew back as though embarrassed by this tender little action.

The company was finishing lunch and planning various excursions. Fauchery was growing increasingly excited with the Countess Sabine's laughter. As he was passing her a dish of fruit their hands touched, and for one second she looked at him with eyes so full of dark meaning that he once more thought of the secret which had been communicated to him one evening after an uproarious dinner. Then, too, she was no longer the same woman. Something was more pronounced than of old, and her gray foulard gown which fitted loosely over her shoulders added a touch of license to her delicate, high-strung elegance.

Georges had made haste to disappear from the scene and had double-locked his door. These gentlemen avoided mutual explanations, though they were none of them deceived as to the reasons which had brought them together. Vandeuvres, who had had a very bad time at play, had really conceived the notion of lying fallow for a season, and he was counting on Nana's presence in the neighborhood as a safeguard against excessive boredom. Fauchery had taken advantage of the holidays granted him by Rose, who just then was extremely busy. He was thinking of discussing a second notice with Nana, in case country air should render them reciprocally affectionate. Daguenet, who had been just a little sulky with her since Steiner had come upon the scene, was dreaming of resuming the old connection or at least of snatching some delightful opportunities if occasion offered. As to the Marquis de Chouard, he was watching for times and seasons. But among all those men who were busy following in the tracks of Venus—a Venus with the rouge scarce washed from her cheeks—Muffat was at once the most ardent and the most tortured by the novel sensations of desire and fear and anger warring in his anguished members. A formal promise had been made him; Nana was awaiting him. Why then had she taken her departure two days sooner than was expected?

That old fellow now on his way to her was coming to keep an appointment! Nana was dumfounded by this ebullition of jealousy, and, greatly moved by the way things were turning out, she took him in her arms and comforted him to the best of her ability. Oh no, he was quite beside the mark; she was expecting no one. If the gentleman came it would not be her fault. What a great ninny that Zizi was to be taking on so about nothing at all!

But this time he was determined to make an end of the torture. Coming along the highroad in the deep quiet of the gloaming, he had meditated a fierce course of action.

Then they chatted about Paris: business there was at a standstill; abominable things had been happening on 'change. When a quarter of an hour had elapsed Muffat took his departure, and, as the young woman was seeing him to the door, he tried without success to make an assignation for the following night. Steiner went up to bed almost directly afterward, grumbling, as he did so, at the everlasting little ailments that seemed to afflict the genus courtesan. The two old boys had been packed off at last! When she was able to rejoin him Nana found Georges still hiding exemplarily behind the curtain. The room was dark. He pulled her down onto the floor as she sat near him, and together they began playfully rolling on the ground, stopping now and again and smothering their laughter with kisses whenever they struck their bare feet against some piece of furniture. Far away, on the road to Gumieres, Count Muffat walked slowly home and, hat in hand, bathed his burning forehead in the freshness and silence of the night.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1221" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两个男人握了握手。缪法把脸朝向暗处，好一阵子一言不发。斯泰内表情阴郁不悦。他们谈到巴黎；生意很难做，交易所里的情况很糟糕。一刻钟以后，缪法告辞了。随后，娜娜送他出门，他要求第二天晚上约会，娜娜没有答应他。斯泰内几乎马上就上楼去睡觉了，嘟嘟囔囔埋怨这些小娘儿们怎么有生不完的毛病。两个老家伙终于被打发走了！当她回到乔治那里时，娜娜觉得他很乖，坐在帷幔后面等着她。房间里黑咕隆咚的。他叫她坐到地板上，坐在他身边；于是他们两人一起在地板上闹着打滚，每当他们光着的脚碰到一件家具上，他们便停下来，连连接吻，避免笑出声来。缪法伯爵走远了，他在居米埃尔大路上，慢慢地走着，把帽子拿在手里，让发热的脑袋沐浴在夜间的清新空气和寂静中。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1222');"><p>During the days that followed Nana found life adorable. In the lad's arms she was once more a girl of fifteen, and under the caressing influence of this renewed childhood love's white flower once more blossomed forth in a nature which had grown hackneyed and disgusted in the service of the other sex. She would experience sudden fits of shame, sudden vivid emotions, which left her trembling. She wanted to laugh and to cry, and she was beset by nervous, maidenly feelings, mingled with warm desires that made her blush again. Never yet had she felt anything comparable to this. The country filled her with tender thoughts. As a little girl she had long wished to dwell in a meadow, tending a goat, because one day on the talus of the fortifications she had seen a goat bleating at the end of its tether. Now this estate, this stretch of land belonging to her, simply swelled her heart to bursting, so utterly had her old ambition been surpassed. Once again she tasted the novel sensations experienced by chits of girls, and at night when she went upstairs, dizzy with her day in the open air and intoxicated by the scent of green leaves, and rejoined her Zizi behind the curtain, she fancied herself a schoolgirl enjoying a holiday escapade. It was an amour, she thought, with a young cousin to whom she was going to be married. And so she trembled at the slightest noise and dread lest parents should hear her, while making the delicious experiments and suffering the voluptuous terrors attendant on a girl's first slip from the path of virtue.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1222" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在以后的几天里，生活是甜蜜的。娜娜躺在男童的怀抱里，仿佛回到了芳龄十五的时代。她早已习惯于男人的爱抚并且对此渐渐感到厌腻，现在受到这个少年的爱抚，爱情之花在她心里又重新开放。她有时面孔羞得通红，有时又兴奋得浑身直打哆嗦，有时想笑，有时又想哭，这些都是因为她那少女纯真的感情受到情欲的侵袭而引起的不安，她对此感到羞耻。她从来没有体味到这种感情。乡间的生活使她沉浸在温情之中。小时候，她就期望着与一只山羊生活在一片草地上，因为有一天，她在城堡的斜坡上，看见一只山羊拴在一根木桩上，在咩咩叫着。现在，这座别墅，这整片土地属于她的了，使她的心情激动不已，这一切远远超过了她过去的奢望。她重新领略了女童的新奇感觉。白天的户外生活令她销魂，花草芳香令她陶醉，晚上，她到楼上找到躲在帷幔后面的治治。这种情景对她来说，似乎像一个离开学校的寄宿女生在度假，她像在与一个表兄弟搞恋爱，她将嫁给他，生怕被父母听见，只要有一点声音就吓得浑身颤抖。她体味着初次失足时的那种甜蜜尝试和心惊肉跳的快感。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1223');"><p>Nana in those days was subject to the fancies a sentimental girl will indulge in. She would gaze at the moon for hours. One night she had a mind to go down into the garden with Georges when all the household was asleep. When there they strolled under the trees, their arms round each other's waists, and finally went and laid down in the grass, where the dew soaked them through and through. On another occasion, after a long silence up in the bedroom, she fell sobbing on the lad's neck, declaring in broken accents that she was afraid of dying. She would often croon a favorite ballad of Mme Lerat's, which was full of flowers and birds. The song would melt her to tears, and she would break off in order to clasp Georges in a passionate embrace and to extract from him vows of undying affection. In short she was extremely silly, as she herself would admit when they both became jolly good fellows again and sat up smoking cigarettes on the edge of the bed, dangling their bare legs over it the while and tapping their heels against its wooden side.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1223" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在这段时间内，娜娜产生一种多愁善感的少女的幻想。她时常几个钟头凝视着月亮出神。一天夜晚，整座房子已经沉睡，她还要乔治同她一起下楼到花园里去，他们互相搂着腰在树下漫步，然后两人往草地上一躺，浑身被露水浸透了。又有一次，她在自己的卧室里，沉默一会后，搂住小伙子的脖子呜咽起来，抽抽噎噎说她怕死。她经常吟唱勒拉太太教她的一首抒情歌曲，歌词尽是花儿鸟儿的，她感动得流下泪花，她不唱时，就热情地把乔治紧紧地搂在怀里，要他发誓永远爱她。总之，正如她自己所承认的，她有点傻。当他们又成了伙伴时，便光着脚在床沿一边抽烟，一边用脚踵踢床板。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1224');"><p>But what utterly melted the young woman's heart was Louiset's arrival. She had an access of maternal affection which was as violent as a mad fit. She would carry off her boy into the sunshine outside to watch him kicking about; she would dress him like a little prince and roll with him in the grass. The moment he arrived she decided that he was to sleep near her, in the room next hers, where Mme Lerat, whom the country greatly affected, used to begin snoring the moment her head touched the pillow. Louiset did not hurt Zizi's position in the least. On the contrary, Nana said that she had now two children, and she treated them with the same wayward tenderness. At night, more than ten times running, she would leave Zizi to go and see if Louiset were breathing properly, but on her return she would re-embrace her Zizi and lavish on him the caresses that had been destined for the child. She played at being Mamma while he wickedly enjoyed being dandled in the arms of the great wench and allowed himself to be rocked to and fro like a baby that is being sent to sleep. It was all so delightful, and Nana was so charmed with her present existence, that she seriously proposed to him never to leave the country. They would send all the other people away, and he, she and the child would live alone. And with that they would make a thousand plans till daybreak and never once hear Mme Lerat as she snored vigorously after the fatigues of a day spent in picking country flowers.

Count Muffat used to come every evening and go away again with disordered face and burning hands. One evening he was not even received, as Steiner had been obliged to run up to Paris. He was told that Madame was not well. Nana grew daily more disgusted at the notion of deceiving Georges. He was such an innocent lad, and he had such faith in her! She would have looked on herself as the lowest of the low had she played him false. Besides, it would have sickened her to do so! Zoe, who took her part in this affair in mute disdain, believed that Madame was growing senseless.

Nana was in hopes that they would end there, when La Faloise sprang from the step in order to receive Gaga and her daughter Amelie in his trembling arms. That brought the number up to eleven people. Their installation proved a laborious undertaking. There were five spare rooms at La Mignotte, one of which was already occupied by Mme Lerat and Louiset. The largest was devoted to the Gaga and La Faloise establishment, and it was decided that Amelie should sleep on a truckle bed in the dressing room at the side. Mignon and his two sons had the third room. Labordette the fourth. There thus remained one room which was transformed into a dormitory with four beds in it for Lucy, Caroline, Tatan and Maria. As to Steiner, he would sleep on the divan in the drawing room. At the end of an hour, when everyone was duly settled, Nana, who had begun by being furious, grew enchanted at the thought of playing hostess on a grand scale. The ladies complimented her on La Mignotte. "It's a stunning property, my dear!" And then, too, they brought her quite a whiff of Parisian air, and talking all together with bursts of laughter and exclamation and emphatic little gestures, they gave her all the petty gossip of the week just past. By the by, and how about Bordenave? What had he said about her prank? Oh, nothing much! After bawling about having her brought back by the police, he had simply put somebody else in her place at night. Little Violaine was the understudy, and she had even obtained a very pretty success as the Blonde Venus. Which piece of news made Nana rather serious.

But Tatan Nene was in a state of triumph! So many were the potatoes she had gathered in her youth that she forgot herself entirely and gave the others much good advice, treating them like geese the while. The gentlemen toiled less strenuously. Mignon looked every inch the good citizen and father and made his stay in the country an occasion for completing his boys' education.

Georges passed through a little door of which he had the key, slipped along the staircase walls and went quietly up into Nana's room. Only he had to wait for her till past midnight. She appeared at last in a high state of intoxication and more maternal even than on the previous nights. Whenever she had drunk anything she became so amorous as to be absurd. Accordingly she now insisted on his accompanying her to the Abbey of Chamont. But he stood out against this; he was afraid of being seen.

The Marquis de Chouard used also to go out every day, but his excuse was doctor's orders. Toward Daguenet and Fauchery Mme Hugon behaved unjustly too. The former especially never left Les Fondettes, for he had given up the idea of renewing the old connection and was busy paying the most respectful attentions to Estelle. Fauchery also stayed with the Muffat ladies. On one occasion only he had met Mignon with an armful of flowers, putting his sons through a course of botanical instruction in a by-path. The two men had shaken hands and given each other the news about Rose. She was perfectly well and happy; they had both received a letter from her that morning in which she besought them to profit by the fresh country air for some days longer. Among all her guests the old lady spared only Count Muffat and Georges. The count, who said he had serious business in Orleans, could certainly not be running after the bad woman, and as to Georges, the poor child was at last causing her grave anxiety, seeing that every evening he was seized with atrocious sick headaches which kept him to his bed in broad daylight.

Theophile Venot, whom Mme Hugon remembered to have invited at the Muffats' last winter, had just arrived. He sat stooping humbly forward and behaved with much good nature, as became a man of no account, nor did he seem to notice the anxious deference with which he was treated. When he had succeeded in getting the company to forget his presence he sat nibbling small lumps of sugar during dessert, looking sharply up at Daguenet as the latter handed Estelle strawberries and listening to Fauchery, who was making the countess very merry over one of his anecdotes. Whenever anyone looked at HIM he smiled in his quiet way. When the guests rose from table he took the count's arm and drew him into the park. He was known to have exercised great influence over the latter ever since the death of his mother. Indeed, singular stories were told about the kind of dominion which the ex-lawyer enjoyed in that household. Fauchery, whom his arrival doubtless embarrassed, began explaining to Georges and Daguenet the origin of the man's wealth. It was a big lawsuit with the management of which the Jesuits had entrusted him in days gone by. In his opinion the worthy man was a terrible fellow despite his gentle, plump face and at this time of day had his finger in all the intrigues of the priesthood. The two young men had begun joking at this, for they thought the little old gentleman had an idiotic expression. The idea of an unknown Venot, a gigantic Venot, acting for the whole body of the clergy, struck them in the light of a comical invention. But they were silenced when, still leaning on the old man's arm, Count Muffat reappeared with blanched cheeks and eyes reddened as if by recent weeping.

This Sunday afternoon was exquisitely mild. There had been signs of rain toward ten in the morning, but the sky, without ceasing to be covered, had, as it were, melted into milky fog, which now hung like a cloud of luminous dust in the golden sunlight. Soon Mme Hugon proposed that they should step down through a little doorway below the terrace and take a walk on foot in the direction of Gumieres and as far as the Choue. She was fond of walking and, considering her threescore years, was very active. Besides, all her guests declared that there was no need to drive. So in a somewhat straggling order they reached the wooden bridge over the river. Fauchery and Daguenet headed the column with the Muffat ladies and were followed by the count and the marquis, walking on either side of Mme Hugon, while Vandeuvres, looking fashionable and out of his element on the highroad, marched in the rear, smoking a cigar. M. Venot, now slackening, now hastening his pace, passed smilingly from group to group, as though bent on losing no scrap of conversation.

The laughter in the carriages had ceased, and faces were turned with an expression of curiosity. The rival parties took stock of each other amid a silence broken only by the measured trot of the horses. In the first carriage Maria Blond and Tatan Nene were lolling backward like a pair of duchesses, their skirts swelling forth over the wheels, and as they passed they cast disdainful glances at the honest women who were walking afoot. Then came Gaga, filling up a whole seat and half smothering La Faloise beside her so that little but his small anxious face was visible. Next followed Caroline Hequet with Labordette, Lucy Stewart with Mignon and his boys and at the close of all Nana in a victoria with Steiner and on a bracket seat in front of her that poor, darling Zizi, with his knees jammed against her own.

It was, in fact, one of those momentary scrutinies which are at once complete and definite. As to the men, they behaved unexceptionably. Fauchery and Daguenet looked icy and recognized no one. The marquis, more nervous than they and afraid of some farcical ebullition on the part of the ladies, had plucked a blade of grass and was rolling it between his fingers. Only Vandeuvres, who had stayed somewhat apart from the rest of the company, winked imperceptibly at Lucy, who smiled at him as she passed.

Bright-colored fabrics fluttered in the wind, and the merry laughter burst forth anew as the voyagers began jesting and glancing back at the respectable folks halting with looks of annoyance at the roadside.

The five carriages were rolling through a flat country along an interminable straight road bordered by fine trees. The country was bathed in a silvery-gray atmosphere. The ladies still continued shouting remarks from carriage to carriage behind the backs of the drivers, who chuckled over their extraordinary fares. Occasionally one of them would rise to her feet to look at the landscape and, supporting herself on her neighbor's shoulder, would grow extremely excited till a sudden jolt brought her down to the seat again. Caroline Hequet in the meantime was having a warm discussion with Labordette. Both of them were agreed that Nana would be selling her country house before three months were out, and Caroline was urging Labordette to buy it back for her for as little as it was likely to fetch. In front of them La Faloise, who was very amorous and could not get at Gaga's apoplectic neck, was imprinting kisses on her spine through her dress, the strained fabric of which was nigh splitting, while Amelie, perching stiffly on the bracket seat, was bidding them be quiet, for she was horrified to be sitting idly by, watching her mother being kissed. In the next carriage Mignon, in order to astonish Lucy, was making his sons recite a fable by La Fontaine. Henri was prodigious at this exercise; he could spout you one without pause or hesitation. But Maria Blond, at the head of the procession, was beginning to feel extremely bored. She was tired of hoaxing that blockhead of a Tatan Nene with a story to the effect that the Parisian dairywomen were wont to fabricate eggs with a mixture of paste and saffron.

Heads were stretched out in Gaga's direction; Maria Blond and Tatan Nene turned round and knelt on the seat while they leaned over the carriage hood, and the air was full of questions and cutting remarks, tempered by a certain obscure admiration. Gaga had known her! The idea filled them all with respect for that far-off past.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1279');"><p>"Dear me, I was young then," continued Gaga. "But never mind, I remember it all. I saw her pass. They said she was disgusting in her own house, but, driving in her carriage, she WAS just smart! And the stunning tales about her! Dirty doings and money flung about like one o'clock! I don't wonder at all that she's got a fine place. Why, she used to clean out a man's pockets as soon as look at him. Irma d'Anglars still in the land of the living! Why, my little pets, she must be near ninety."

The deuce, there wasn't one of them, as Lucy loudly declared, who would live to that age. They were all done for. Besides, Nana said she didn't want to make old bones; it wouldn't be amusing. They were drawing near their destination, and the conversation was interrupted by the cracking of whips as the drivers put their horses to their best paces. Yet amid all the noise Lucy continued talking and, suddenly changing the subject, urged Nana to come to town with them all to-morrow. The exhibition was soon to close, and the ladies must really return to Paris, where the season was surpassing their expectations. But Nana was obstinate. She loathed Paris; she wouldn't set foot there yet!

With his whip one of the drivers had to point them out the ruins of the old Abbey of Chamont where they lay hidden among trees. It was a great sell! The ladies voted them silly. Why, they were only a heap of old stones with briers growing over them and part of a tumble-down tower. It really wasn't worth coming a couple of leagues to see that! Then the driver pointed out to them the countryseat, the park of which stretched away from the abbey, and he advised them to take a little path and follow the walls surrounding it. They would thus make the tour of the place while the carriages would go and await them in the village square. It was a delightful walk, and the company agreed to the proposition.

</p></origin><translate id="div_1283" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊唷！伊尔玛混得真不错！”加加说着，她停在一道铁栅栏门前，这道门朝着大路，在花园的一个拐角上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1284');"><p>All of them stood silently gazing at the enormous bush which stopped up the gateway. Then following the little path, they skirted the park wall, looking up from time to time to admire the trees, whose lofty branches stretched out over them and formed a dense vault of greenery. After three minutes or so they found themselves in front of a second gate. Through this a wide lawn was visible, over which two venerable oaks cast dark masses of shadow. Three minutes farther on yet another gate afforded them an extensive view of a great avenue, a perfect corridor of shadow, at the end of which a bright spot of sunlight gleamed like a star. They stood in silent, wondering admiration, and then little by little exclamations burst from their lips. They had been trying hard to joke about it all with a touch of envy at heart, but this decidedly and immeasurably impressed them. What a genius that Irma was! A sight like this gave you a rattling notion of the woman! The trees stretched away and away, and there were endlessly recurrent patches of ivy along the wall with glimpses of lofty roofs and screens of poplars interspersed with dense masses of elms and aspens. Was there no end to it then? The ladies would have liked to catch sight of the mansion house, for they were weary of circling on and on, weary of seeing nothing but leafy recesses through every opening they came to. They took the rails of the gate in their hands and pressed their faces against the ironwork. And thus excluded and isolated, a feeling of respect began to overcome them as they thought of the castle lost to view in surrounding immensity. Soon, being quite unused to walking, they grew tired. And the wall did not leave off; at every turn of the small deserted path the same range of gray stones stretched ahead of them. Some of them began to despair of ever getting to the end of it and began talking of returning. But the more their long walk fatigued them, the more respectful they became, for at each successive step they were increasingly impressed by the tranquil, lordly dignity of the domain.

Suddenly the path gave a final turn; the wall ended, and as they came out on the village square the mansion house stood before them on the farther side of its grand outer court. All stopped to admire the proud sweep of the wide steps, the twenty frontage windows, the arrangement of the three wings, which were built of brick framed by courses of stone. Henri IV had erewhile inhabited this historic mansion, and his room, with its great bed hung with Genoa velvet, was still preserved there. Breathless with admiration, Nana gave a little childish sigh.

She recognized her perfectly. She was as upright as of old, the hoary campaigner, and that despite her age, and she still had those eyes which flashed when she moved in that proud way of hers! Vespers were just over, and for a second or two Madame stood in the church porch. She was dressed in a dark brown silk and looked very simple and very tall, her venerable face reminding one of some old marquise who had survived the horrors of the Great Revolution. In her right hand a huge Book of Hours shone in the sunlight, and very slowly she crossed the square, followed some fifteen paces off by a footman in livery. The church was emptying, and all the inhabitants of Chamont bowed before her with extreme respect. An old man even kissed her hand, and a woman wanted to fall on her knees. Truly this was a potent queen, full of years and honors. She mounted her flight of steps and vanished from view.

Maria Blond let slip a foul expression and vexed Lucy, who declared that one ought to honor gray hairs. All the women, to sum up, agreed that she was a perfect marvel. Then the company got into their conveyances again. From Chamont all the way to La Mignotte Nana remained silent. She had twice turned round to look back at the house, and now, lulled by the sound of the wheels, she forgot that Steiner was at her side and that Georges was in front of her. A vision had come up out of the twilight, and the great lady seemed still to be sweeping by with all the majesty of a potent queen, full of years and of honors.

Nana, who had grown increasingly absent-minded and singular in point of manner, had sent him to ask his mamma's forgiveness. It was his plain duty, she remarked severely, growing suddenly solicitous for the decencies of family life. She even made him swear not to return for the night; she was tired, and in showing proper obedience he was doing no more than his duty. Much bored by this moral discourse, Georges appeared in his mother's presence with heavy heart and downcast head.

Mme Hugon was content to look at him with eyes full of tears while Philippe, who had been put in possession of the facts, threatened to go and drag him home by the scruff of the neck if ever he went back into that woman's society. Somewhat comforted, Georges began slyly planning how to make his escape toward two o'clock next day in order to arrange about future meetings with Nana.

Vandeuvres had given notice of departure, for he was anxious to take Lucy back to Paris with him. He was amused at the idea of carrying off this girl whom he had known for ten years yet never desired. The Marquis de Chouard bent over his plate and meditated on Gaga's young lady. He could well remember dandling Lili on his knee. What a way children had of shooting up! This little thing was becoming extremely plump! But Count Muffat especially was silent and absorbed. His cheeks glowed, and he had given Georges one long look. Dinner over, he went upstairs, intending to shut himself in his bedroom, his pretext being a slight feverish attack. M. Venot had rushed after him, and upstairs in the bedroom a scene ensued. The count threw himself upon the bed and strove to stifle a fit of nervous sobbing in the folds of the pillow while M. Venot, in a soft voice, called him brother and advised him to implore heaven for mercy. But he heard nothing: there was a rattle in his throat. Suddenly he sprang off the bed and stammered:

Once on the highroad the count walked so rapidly that his companion had to run in order to follow him. Though utterly out of breath, the latter never ceased showering on him the most conclusive arguments against the temptations of the flesh. But the other never opened his mouth as he hurried away into the night. Arrived in front of La Mignotte, he said simply:

Nana had found a letter from Bordenave awaiting her, in which he advised rest, just as though he were anxious to be rid of her. Little Violaine, he said, was being encored twice nightly. But when Mignon continued urging her to come away with them on the morrow Nana grew exasperated and declared that she did not intend taking advice from anybody. In other ways, too, her behavior at table was ridiculously stuck up. Mme Lerat having made some sharp little speech or other, she loudly announced that, God willing, she wasn't going to let anyone—no, not even her own aunt—make improper remarks in her presence. After which she dreed her guests with honorable sentiments. She seemed to be suffering from a fit of stupid right-mindedness, and she treated them all to projects of religious education for Louiset and to a complete scheme of regeneration for herself. When the company began laughing she gave vent to profound opinions, nodding her head like a grocer's wife who knows what she is saying. Nothing but order could lead to fortune! And so far as she was concerned, she had no wish to die like a beggar! She set the ladies' teeth on edge. They burst out in protest. Could anyone have been converting Nana? No, it was impossible! But she sat quite still and with absent looks once more plunged into dreamland, where the vision of an extremely wealthy and greatly courted Nana rose up before her.

In affairs of this kind Labordette was wont to display the most perfect tact and cleverness. Indeed, he seemed delighted to be making other people happy. Nana showed no surprise; she was only somewhat annoyed by the excessive heat of Muffat's pursuit. Life was a serious affair, was it not? Love was too silly: it led to nothing.
