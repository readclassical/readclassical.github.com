</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_412');"><p>The countess Sabine, as it had become customary to call Mme Muffat de Beuville in order to distinguish her from the count's mother, who had died the year before, was wont to receive every Tuesday in her house in the Rue Miromesnil at the corner of the Rue de Pentievre. It was a great square building, and the Muffats had lived in it for a hundred years or more. On the side of the street its frontage seemed to slumber, so lofty was it and dark, so sad and convent-like, with its great outer shutters, which were nearly always closed. And at the back in a little dark garden some trees had grown up and were straining toward the sunlight with such long slender branches that their tips were visible above the roof.
</p></origin><translate id="div_412" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>人们习惯于把缪法德伯维尔夫人称之为萨比娜伯爵夫人，以免与前一年谢世的伯爵母亲的称谓相混淆。萨比娜伯爵夫人每逢星期二都在她的公馆里接待客人，公馆坐落在米罗梅斯尼尔街，就在庞蒂埃夫街的拐弯处。这是一座方形大建筑，缪法家已经在此住了一百余年了。房子的正面临街，又高又黑，毫无生机，阴森得像座修道院，高大的百叶窗，几乎总是关得严严的；屋子的后边，有一个土壤湿润的花园，花园的一端，长着几株树，树长得又高又细，仿佛在寻找阳光，枝桠高出了石板瓦屋顶。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_413');"><p>This particular Tuesday, toward ten o'clock in the evening, there were scarcely a dozen people in the drawing room. When she was only expecting intimate friends the countess opened neither the little drawing room nor the dining room. One felt more at home on such occasions and chatted round the fire. The drawing room was very large and very lofty; its four windows looked out upon the garden, from which, on this rainy evening of the close of April, issued a sensation of damp despite the great logs burning on the hearth. The sun never shone down into the room; in the daytime it was dimly lit up by a faint greenish light, but at night, when the lamps and the chandelier were burning, it looked merely a serious old chamber with its massive mahogany First Empire furniture, its hangings and chair coverings of yellow velvet, stamped with a large design. Entering it, one was in an atmosphere of cold dignity, of ancient manners, of a vanished age, the air of which seemed devotional.
</p></origin><translate id="div_413" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>本周星期二，已经临近晚上十点钟了，客厅里才来了十来个客人。倘若来的客人都是亲密好友，她就既不开小客厅，也不开餐厅。这样，大家显得更亲密一些，还可以围着火炉聊天。客厅又大又高，有四扇窗户朝向花园，现在已是四月底了，天气多雨，虽然壁炉里燃着大块劈材，大家仍然感到花园里有一股湿气袭来；白天，淡绿色的光线把房间里照得若明若暗；但是，到了夜晚，台灯和吊灯都点亮后，这间客厅里却显出一派庄严气氛，陈设有拿破仑时代式样的笨重桃花心木家具，有黄丝绒的帷幔和椅套，上面印着光滑如缎的大图案。进了这间客厅，仿佛置身于冷冰冰的庄严气氛中，置身于古老的习俗之中，置身于一个流逝了的散发着虔诚宗教气息的时代之中。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_414');"><p>Opposite the armchair, however, in which the count's mother had died—a square armchair of formal design and inhospitable padding, which stood by the hearthside—the Countess Sabine was seated in a deep and cozy lounge, the red silk upholsteries of which were soft as eider down. It was the only piece of modern furniture there, a fanciful item introduced amid the prevailing severity and clashing with it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_414" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>壁炉的一边，有一张方形扶手椅，木质坚硬，椅罩布面粗糙，伯爵的母亲就是坐在这张椅子上去世的。在壁炉的另一边，也就是那张扶手椅的对面，萨比娜伯爵夫人坐在一张深座椅子上，椅垫是红绸做的，柔软得像鸭绒。这是客厅里唯一的现代家具，在严肃的气氛中，摆着这样一件新奇的东西，显得很不协调。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_415');"><p>"So we shall have the shah of Persia," the young woman was saying.
</p></origin><translate id="div_415" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这么说来，”年轻的伯爵夫人说道，“波斯沙赫①要到我们这里来喽……”  
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_416');"><p>They were talking of the crowned heads who were coming to Paris for the exhibition. Several ladies had formed a circle round the hearth, and Mme du Joncquoy, whose brother, a diplomat, had just fulfilled a mission in the East, was giving some details about the court of Nazr-ed-Din.
</p></origin><translate id="div_416" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她们谈论那些要来巴黎参观万国博览会的王公贵族。好几位太太围着壁炉坐着。杜荣古瓦太太有个兄弟是外交官，已经完成出使东方任务归来，现在由她来介绍纳札尔埃丹宫廷的详细情况。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_417');"><p>"Are you out of sorts, my dear?" asked Mme Chantereau, the wife of an ironmaster, seeing the countess shivering slightly and growing pale as she did so.
</p></origin><translate id="div_417" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你不舒服吗，亲爱的？”尚特罗太太看见伯爵夫人打了一个哆嗦，脸色发白，问道。她是一个冶金作坊主的妻子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_418');"><p>"Oh no, not at all," replied the latter, smiling. "I felt a little cold. This drawing room takes so long to warm."
</p></origin><translate id="div_418" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，一点也不，”伯爵夫人笑着回答道，“我身上有点冷……这间客厅生火后，要好长时间才能热起来！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_419');"><p>And with that she raised her melancholy eyes and scanned the walls from floor to ceiling. Her daughter Estelle, a slight, insignificant-looking girl of sixteen, the thankless period of life, quitted the large footstool on which she was sitting and silently came and propped up one of the logs which had rolled from its place. But Mme de Chezelles, a convent friend of Sabine's and her junior by five years, exclaimed:
</p></origin><translate id="div_419" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她用忧郁的目光望着墙壁，一直望到天花板。她的女儿爱丝泰勒，芳龄十八，已到青春期，身材颀长，毫不引人注目，她从圆凳上站起来，悄然走来把一块滚落的劈柴扶起来。可是萨比娜在修道院时的女友、比她小五岁的德谢泽勒太太大声说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_420');"><p>"Dear me, I would gladly be possessed of a drawing room such as yours! At any rate, you are able to receive visitors. They only build boxes nowadays. Oh, if I were in your place!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_420" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！我倒想有你这样一间大客厅！至少，你可以用它来接待客人……如今，造的房子全像盒子……如果我是你的话……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_421');"><p>She ran giddily on and with lively gestures explained how she would alter the hangings, the seats—everything, in fact. Then she would give balls to which all Paris should run. Behind her seat her husband, a magistrate, stood listening with serious air. It was rumored that she deceived him quite openly, but people pardoned her offense and received her just the same, because, they said, "she's not answerable for her actions."
</p></origin><translate id="div_421" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她说话冒冒失失，手舞足蹈。她说如果是她的客厅，她就要把帷幔、椅子和其它东西统统换成新的，然后举行舞会，让全巴黎的人都来参加。她的丈夫呆在她的后面，一本正经地听她说话，他是一名行政官员。据说，她偷人不瞒丈夫；但是大家都原谅她，依然接待她，因为听说她神经有些不正常。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_422');"><p>"Oh that Leonide!" the Countess Sabine contented herself by murmuring, smiling her faint smile the while.
</p></origin><translate id="div_422" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这个莱奥妮德！”萨比娜伯爵夫人只嘟哝了一句，脸上露出淡淡一笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_423');"><p>With a languid movement she eked out the thought that was in her. After having lived there seventeen years she certainly would not alter her drawing room now. It would henceforth remain just such as her mother-in-law had wished to preserve it during her lifetime. Then returning to the subject of conversation:
</p></origin><translate id="div_423" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她做了一个懒洋洋的手势，以补充她所没有说出的想法。当然罗，要改变客厅的样子，也不会在这里住了十七年才来改变，现在，她要让客厅保持她婆婆在世时所要求保留的样子。 随后，她又回到原来的话题上： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_424');"><p>"I have been assured," she said, "that we shall also have the king of Prussia and the emperor of Russia."
</p></origin><translate id="div_424" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“人家还告诉我，普鲁士国王和俄国皇帝肯定也要来哩。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_425');"><p>"Yes, some very fine fetes are promised," said Mme du Joncquoy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_425" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对，已经宣布还要举行盛大庆祝活动哩。”杜荣古瓦太太说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_426');"><p>The banker Steiner, not long since introduced into this circle by Leonide de Chezelles, who was acquainted with the whole of Parisian society, was sitting chatting on a sofa between two of the windows. He was questioning a deputy, from whom he was endeavoring with much adroitness to elicit news about a movement on the stock exchange of which he had his suspicions, while the Count Muffat, standing in front of them, was silently listening to their talk, looking, as he did so, even grayer than was his wont.
</p></origin><translate id="div_426" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>银行家斯泰内是刚刚由熟悉全巴黎社交界人士的莱奥妮德德谢泽勒带来的，他坐在两扇窗户中间的一张长沙发上，正在与人谈话呢；他正向一个众议员提问题，他很想从他的口中，巧妙地套出一些有关交易所的消息，斯泰内已觉察到交易所的一些动向了。缪法伯爵站立在他们前面，一声不吭，听他们两人谈话，脸色比平常还灰白。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_427');"><p>Four or five young men formed another group near the door round the Count Xavier de Vandeuvres, who in a low tone was telling them an anecdote. It was doubtless a very risky one, for they were choking with laughter. Companionless in the center of the room, a stout man, a chief clerk at the Ministry of the Interior, sat heavily in an armchair, dozing with his eyes open. But when one of the young men appeared to doubt the truth of the anecdote Vandeuvres raised his voice.
</p></origin><translate id="div_427" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>门边有四五个年轻人聚集在一起，围着格扎维埃德旺德夫尔伯爵，他正在低声向他们讲故事。这则故事的内容大概很下流，因为几个年轻人低声笑个不停。在屋子的中央，一个胖男人独自一人沉沉地坐在一张扶手椅上，睁着眼睛在打盹，他是内务部办公室主任。不过，其中一个青年对这个故事显得有些怀疑，旺德夫尔提高嗓门说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_428');"><p>"You are too much of a skeptic, Foucarmont; you'll spoil all your pleasures that way."
</p></origin><translate id="div_428" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你是个十足的怀疑派，富卡蒙；这样，你就破坏了你的乐趣。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_429');"><p>And he returned to the ladies with a laugh. Last scion of a great family, of feminine manners and witty tongue, he was at that time running through a fortune with a rage of life and appetite which nothing could appease. His racing stable, which was one of the best known in Paris, cost him a fabulous amount of money; his betting losses at the Imperial Club amounted monthly to an alarming number of pounds, while taking one year with another, his mistresses would be always devouring now a farm, now some acres of arable land or forest, which amounted, in fact, to quite a respectable slice of his vast estates in Picardy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_429" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他讲完便笑眯眯地走到太太们这边来。旺德夫尔是一家名门望族的末代子孙，气质像是女性，聪明而又诙谐，他挥金如土，坐食祖宗留下来的遗产，贪婪的欲望无法抑制。他饲养的赛马，算得上巴黎最有名的赛马，这项花费高得惊人；他每月在帝国俱乐部赌输的钱也令人震惊；他的情妇们不管年成好坏，每年要吃掉他一个农庄、数公顷土地或森林，挥霍掉他在庇卡底的大批产业的一部分。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_430');"><p>"I advise you to call other people skeptics! Why, you don't believe a thing yourself," said Leonide, making shift to find him a little space in which to sit down at her side.
</p></origin><translate id="div_430" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我劝你索性把其他人也都称作怀疑派吧，而你自己就什么也不相信，”莱奥妮德说道，一边在自己旁边让点地方给他，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_431');"><p>"It's you who spoil your own pleasures."
</p></origin><translate id="div_431" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是你破坏了自己的乐趣。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_432');"><p>"Exactly," he replied. "I wish to make others benefit by my experience."
</p></origin><translate id="div_432" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说得一点不错，”他回答道，“我正是要让别人吸取我的经验教训。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_433');"><p>But the company imposed silence on him: he was scandalizing M. Venot. And, the ladies having changed their positions, a little old man of sixty, with bad teeth and a subtle smile, became visible in the depths of an easy chair. There he sat as comfortably as in his own house, listening to everybody's remarks and making none himself. With a slight gesture he announced himself by no means scandalized. Vandeuvres once more assumed his dignified bearing and added gravely:
</p></origin><translate id="div_433" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，大伙不让他再说下去，因为他惹怒了韦诺先生。这时，太太们坐得散开了一点，大家透过空隙看见一个年届花甲的小老头坐在一张长椅的一端，他露出一口坏牙齿，脸上堆满狡黠的微笑。他呆在那儿就像在家里一样，一声不吭，听着大家讲话。他摆摆手，说他并没有生气。于是，旺德夫尔又神气起来，一本正经地继续说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_434');"><p>"Monsieur Venot is fully aware that I believe what it is one's duty to believe."
</p></origin><translate id="div_434" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“韦诺先生很了解我，我只相信应该相信的东西。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_435');"><p>It was an act of faith, and even Leonide appeared satisfied. The young men at the end of the room no longer laughed; the company were old fogies, and amusement was not to be found there. A cold breath of wind had passed over them, and amid the ensuing silence Steiner's nasal voice became audible. The deputy's discreet answers were at last driving him to desperation. For a second or two the Countess Sabine looked at the fire; then she resumed the conversation.
</p></origin><translate id="div_435" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他这是表明自己信仰宗教。莱奥妮德听了似乎很满意。坐在客厅后面的那些年轻人不再笑了，客厅里的人都露出一本正经的样子，没有什么可好笑的。一阵冷风吹过，在一片寂静中，只听见斯泰内的带鼻音的说话声，参议员说话很谨慎，终于使斯泰内大为恼火。萨比娜伯爵夫人瞅了一会儿炉火，接着，她又继续说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_436');"><p>"I saw the king of Prussia at Baden-Baden last year. He's still full of vigor for his age."
</p></origin><translate id="div_436" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“去年我在巴登看见普鲁士国王。在他这样的年龄，精力还算挺好的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_437');"><p>"Count Bismarck is to accompany him," said Mme du Joncquoy. "Do you know the count? I lunched with him at my brother's ages ago, when he was representative of Prussia in Paris. There's a man now whose latest successes I cannot in the least understand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_437" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“俾斯麦伯爵将陪同他一道来，”杜荣古瓦太太说，“你们认识俾斯麦伯爵吗？在我兄弟家里，我与他共进过午餐。哦！那是很久以前的事了，那时他才是普鲁士驻法国的大使…… 这样一个人，最近居然连连取得成功，我真莫名其妙。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_438');"><p>"But why?" asked Mme Chantereau.
</p></origin><translate id="div_438" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“为什么？”尚特罗太太问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_439');"><p>"Good gracious, how am I to explain? He doesn't please me. His appearance is boorish and underbred. Besides, so far as I am concerned, I find him stupid."
</p></origin><translate id="div_439" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“老天爷！叫我怎么对你说呢……我不喜欢这个人，他样子粗鲁，又缺乏教养。而且，我觉得他有些愚蠢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_440');"><p>With that the whole room spoke of Count Bismarck, and opinions differed considerably. Vandeuvres knew him and assured the company that he was great in his cups and at play. But when the discussion was at its height the door was opened, and Hector de la Falois made his appearance. Fauchery, who followed in his wake, approached the countess and, bowing:
</p></origin><translate id="div_440" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，大家都谈论起俾斯麦伯爵来。对俾斯麦的看法，众说纷纭。旺德夫尔认识他，并说他酒量很大，赌技出色。可是，到了争论最激烈的时候，门开了，埃克托尔德拉法卢瓦兹进来了。福什利跟在他后边，他走到伯爵夫人面前，鞠了个躬，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_441');"><p>"Madame," he said, "I have not forgotten your extremely kind invitation."
</p></origin><translate id="div_441" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，对您的美好邀请，我时刻铭记在心……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_442');"><p>She smiled and made a pretty little speech. The journalist, after bowing to the count, stood for some moments in the middle of the drawing room. He only recognized Steiner and accordingly looked rather out of his element. But Vandeuvres turned and came and shook hands with him. And forthwith, in his delight at the meeting and with a sudden desire to be confidential, Fauchery buttonholed him and said in a low voice:
</p></origin><translate id="div_442" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵夫人莞尔一笑，说了句客套话。新闻记者行礼后，在客厅中间愣了一会儿，他觉得人地生疏，客人中他只认识斯泰内。旺德夫尔转过身子，走过来跟他握手。遇到旺德夫尔，福什利顿时高兴起来，他想跟他说句内心话，便把他拉到一边，悄悄说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_443');"><p>"It's tomorrow. Are you going?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_443" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就定在明天，你也去吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_444');"><p>"Egad, yes."
</p></origin><translate id="div_444" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然罗！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_445');"><p>"At midnight, at her house.
</p></origin><translate id="div_445" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夜里十二点到她家里。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_446');"><p>"I know, I know. I'm going with Blanche."
</p></origin><translate id="div_446" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道，我知道……我与布朗瑟一起去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_447');"><p>He wanted to escape and return to the ladies in order to urge yet another reason in M. de Bismarck's favor. But Fauchery detained him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_447" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他想离开福什利，回到太太们那儿去，提出一个新的证据，为俾斯麦辩护，但福什利把他拉住了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_448');"><p>"You never will guess whom she has charged me to invite."
</p></origin><translate id="div_448" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你绝对猜不到她托我邀请谁到她家里去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_449');"><p>And with a slight nod he indicated Count Muffat, who was just then discussing a knotty point in the budget with Steiner and the deputy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_449" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，他将头向着缪法伯爵微微一指，这时伯爵正在与参议员和斯泰内讨论国民预算上的一个问题。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_450');"><p>"It's impossible," said Vandeuvres, stupefaction and merriment in his tones. "My word on it! I had to swear that I would bring him to her. Indeed, that's one of my reasons for coming here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_450" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不可能！”旺德夫尔惊喜交集地说。 “我敢发誓！我还不得不向她保证把斯泰内带到哩。这也是我来这里的目的之一。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_451');"><p>Both laughed silently, and Vandeuvres, hurriedly rejoining the circle of ladies, cried out:
</p></origin><translate id="div_451" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说到这里，两个人都暗暗地笑了，而旺德夫尔又匆匆忙忙跑到太太们圈子里来，他大声嚷道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_452');"><p>"I declare that on the contrary Monsieur de Bismarck is exceedingly witty. For instance, one evening he said a charmingly epigrammatic thing in my presence."
</p></origin><translate id="div_452" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我可以肯定，恰恰相反，俾斯麦先生是非常风趣的人……比如说吧，一天晚上，他在我面前说了一句逗人的话……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_453');"><p>La Faloise meanwhile had heard the few rapid sentences thus whisperingly interchanged, and he gazed at Fauchery in hopes of an explanation which was not vouchsafed him. Of whom were they talking, and what were they going to do at midnight tomorrow? He did not leave his cousin's side again. The latter had gone and seated himself. He was especially interested by the Countess Sabine. Her name had often been mentioned in his presence, and he knew that, having been married at the age of seventeen, she must now be thirty-four and that since her marriage she had passed a cloistered existence with her husband and her mother-in-law. In society some spoke of her as a woman of religious chastity, while others pitied her and recalled to memory her charming bursts of laughter and the burning glances of her great eyes in the days prior to her imprisonment in this old town house. Fauchery scrutinized her and yet hesitated. One of his friends, a captain who had recently died in Mexico, had, on the very eve of his departure, made him one of those gross postprandial confessions, of which even the most prudent among men are occasionally guilty. But of this he only retained a vague recollection; they had dined not wisely but too well that evening, and when he saw the countess, in her black dress and with her quiet smile, seated in that Old World drawing room, he certainly had his doubts. A lamp which had been placed behind her threw into clear relief her dark, delicate, plump side face, wherein a certain heaviness in the contours of the mouth alone indicated a species of imperious sensuality.
</p></origin><translate id="div_453" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他俩讲话很快，你一言我一语，声音很低，但都被拉法卢瓦兹听见了，他注视着福什利，希望他过来解释一下，但福什利始终没过来。他们说的是谁呢？明天半夜他们要干什么呢？于是，他再也不离开他的表哥。福什利走过去坐下来。使他特别感兴趣的是萨比娜伯爵夫人。过去时常有人在他面前提到她的名字，她是十七岁结婚的，现在大概三十四岁了，婚后过着与世隔绝的生活，整天见到的人只有丈夫和婆婆。在上流社会里，有人说她冷若冰霜，像个虔诚的教徒，也有人很同情她，说她在嫁到这座深宅老院前，笑声朗朗，目光炯炯有神。福什利一边凝视着她，一边思量着一件事。他有一个朋友，最近在墨西哥战死，死时是上尉，就在他出发前夕，同福什利一起吃饭，饭后，他无意中向福什利吐露了一段隐情，这种隐情，即便是最谨慎的男人，在某些时候，也是会泄露出来的。不过，这事在福什利的回忆中已变得模糊了；那天晚上，他们吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐。现在，他看见伯爵夫人坐在古色古香的客厅的中央，身着黑色衣服，安详地微笑着，心里起了疑团。她身后有一盏灯，把她那丰腴、微黑的面孔侧面照得轮廓分明，脸上只有嘴唇有点厚，露出一种急切的情欲要求。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_454');"><p>"What do they want with their Bismarck?" muttered La Faloise, whose constant pretense it was to be bored in good society. "One's ready to kick the bucket here. A pretty idea of yours it was to want to come!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_454" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们老谈俾斯麦，有什么用！”拉法卢瓦兹嘀咕道，他装出一副在社交场合中露出的那种无聊的神态，“在这儿，真要命。你的想法真古怪，偏要到这里来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_455');"><p>Fauchery questioned him abruptly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_455" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>福什利忽然问他道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_456');"><p>"Now tell me, does the countess admit someone to her embraces?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_456" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂！伯爵夫人不跟任何人睡觉吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_457');"><p>"Oh dear, no, no! My dear fellow!" he stammered, manifestly taken aback and quite forgetting his pose. "Where d'you think we are?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_457" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！不，啊！不，亲爱的，”他结结巴巴说道，显得不知所措，忘记做出装腔作势的样子，“你也不看看这儿是什么地方！”

There's a little chap out there, Foucarmont they call him, who's to be met with everywhere and at every turn. One's seen faster men than that, though, you bet. However, it doesn't concern me, and indeed, all I know is that if the countess indulges in high jinks she's still pretty sly about it, for the thing never gets about—nobody talks."

Amid the conversation of the ladies, which still continued in front of the hearth, they both spoke in subdued tones, and, seeing them there with their white cravats and gloves, one might have supposed them to be discussing in chosen phraseology some really serious topic. Old Mme Muffat then, whom La Faloise had been well acquainted with, was an insufferable old lady, always hand in glove with the priests. She had the grand manner, besides, and an authoritative way of comporting herself, which bent everybody to her will. As to Muffat, he was an old man's child; his father, a general, had been created count by Napoleon I, and naturally he had found himself in favor after the second of December. He hadn't much gaiety of manner either, but he passed for a very honest man of straightforward intentions and understanding. Add to these a code of old aristocratic ideas and such a lofty conception of his duties at court, of his dignities and of his virtues, that he behaved like a god on wheels. It was the Mamma Muffat who had given him this precious education with its daily visits to the confessional, its complete absence of escapades and of all that is meant by youth. He was a practicing Christian and had attacks of faith of such fiery violence that they might be likened to accesses of burning fever. Finally, in order to add a last touch to the picture, La Faloise whispered something in his cousin's ear.

She did not look her age; one would have set her down as being twenty-eight at most, for her eyes, above all, which were filled with the dark blue shadow of her long eyelashes, retained the glowing light of youth. Bred in a divided family, so that she used to spend one month with the Marquis de Chouard, another with the marquise, she had been married very young, urged on, doubtless, by her father, whom she embarrassed after her mother's death. A terrible man was the marquis, a man about whom strange tales were beginning to be told, and that despite his lofty piety! Fauchery asked if he should have the honor of meeting him. Certainly her father was coming, but only very late; he had so much work on hand! The journalist thought he knew where the old gentleman passed his evenings and looked grave. But a mole, which he noticed close to her mouth on the countess's left cheek, surprised him. Nana had precisely the same mole. It was curious. Tiny hairs curled up on it, only they were golden in Nana's case, black as jet in this. Ah well, never mind! This woman enjoyed nobody's embraces.

One had only to look at her there by the side of that daughter of hers, sitting so insignificant and constrained on her footstool. That sepulchral drawing room of hers, which exhaled odors suggestive of being in a church, spoke as plainly as words could of the iron hand, the austere mode of existence, that weighed her down. There was nothing suggestive of her own personality in that ancient abode, black with the damps of years. It was Muffat who made himself felt there, who dominated his surroundings with his devotional training, his penances and his fasts. But the sight of the little old gentleman with the black teeth and subtle smile whom he suddenly discovered in his armchair behind the group of ladies afforded him a yet more decisive argument. He knew the personage. It was Theophile Venot, a retired lawyer who had made a specialty of church cases. He had left off practice with a handsome fortune and was now leading a sufficiently mysterious existence, for he was received everywhere, treated with great deference and even somewhat feared, as though he had been the representative of a mighty force, an occult power, which was felt to be at his back. Nevertheless, his behavior was very humble. He was churchwarden at the Madeleine Church and had simply accepted the post of deputy mayor at the town house of the Ninth Arrondissement in order, as he said, to have something to do in his leisure time. Deuce take it, the countess was well guarded; there was nothing to be done in that quarter.

The door had just been opened anew, and an old lady had come in, followed by a young man in whom the journalist recognized the truant schoolboy, perpetrator of the famous and as yet unforgotten "tres chic" of the Blonde Venus first night. This lady's arrival caused a stir among the company. The Countess Sabine had risen briskly from her seat in order to go and greet her, and she had taken both her hands in hers and addressed her as her "dear Madame Hugon." Seeing that his cousin viewed this little episode with some curiosity, La Faloise sought to arouse his interest and in a few brief phrases explained the position. Mme Hugon, widow of a notary, lived in retirement at Les Fondettes, an old estate of her family's in the neighborhood of Orleans, but she also kept up a small establishment in Paris in a house belonging to her in the Rue de Richelieu and was now passing some weeks there in order to settle her youngest son, who was reading the law and in his "first year." In old times she had been a dear friend of the Marquise de Chouard and had assisted at the birth of the countess, who, prior to her marriage, used to stay at her house for months at a time and even now was quite familiarly treated by her.

All the ladies behaved to her with respectful sympathy, and conversation was resumed in a tone at once more amiable and more refined. Fauchery, at sight of that respectable Mme Hugon, that motherly face lit up with such a kindly smile beneath its broad tresses of white hair, thought how foolish he had been to suspect the Countess Sabine even for an instant.

One might have described it as an experiment, marking the birth of an appetite and of an enjoyment. Then he forgot where he was, fell into brown study and in thought even harked back to that vague confidential announcement imparted to him one evening in the dining room of a restaurant. Impelled by a sort of sensuous curiosity, he had always wanted an introduction into the Muffats' circle, and now that his friend was in Mexico through all eternity, who could tell what might happen? "We shall see," he thought. It was a folly, doubtless, but the idea kept tormenting him; he felt himself drawn on and his animal nature aroused.

It was the eldest daughter of the Baronne de Fougeray, who, under stress of an irresistible vocation, had just entered the Carmelite Convent.

"A blackguard woman," he said, lowering his voice behind the ladies' armchairs. Fauchery looked at her as she sat quaintly perched, in her voluminous ball dress of pale blue satin, on the corner of her armchair. She looked as slight and impudent as a boy, and he ended by feeling astonished at seeing her there. People comported themselves better at Caroline Hequet's, whose mother had arranged her house on serious principles. Here was a perfect subject for an article. What a strange world was this world of Paris! The most rigid circles found themselves invaded. Evidently that silent Theophile Venot, who contented himself by smiling and showing his ugly teeth, must have been a legacy from the late countess. So, too, must have been such ladies of mature age as Mme Chantereau and Mme du Joncquoy, besides four or five old gentlemen who sat motionless in corners. The Count Muffat attracted to the house a series of functionaries, distinguished by the immaculate personal appearance which was at that time required of the men at the Tuileries. Among others there was the chief clerk, who still sat solitary in the middle of the room with his closely shorn cheeks, his vacant glance and his coat so tight of fit that he could scarce venture to move. Almost all the young men and certain individuals with distinguished, aristocratic manners were the Marquis de Chouard's contribution to the circle, he having kept touch with the Legitimist party after making his peace with the empire on his entrance into the Council of State. There remained Leonide de Chezelles and Steiner, an ugly little knot against which Mme Hugon's elderly and amiable serenity stood out in strange contrast. And Fauchery, having sketched out his article, named this last group "Countess Sabine's little clique."

She was living in the Chateau de Beaurecueil, two leagues farther off, and she used to come in daily in a carriage and pair in order to visit him at the Lion d'Or, where he had put up. The carriage used to wait at the door, and Leonide would stay for hours in the house, while a crowd gathered round and looked at the horses."

Two young men were whispering, but they ceased in their turn, and the hushed step of Count Muffat was alone audible as he crossed the floor. The lamps seemed to have paled; the fire was going out; a stern shadow fell athwart the old friends of the house where they sat in the chairs they had occupied there for forty years back. It was as though in a momentary pause of conversation the invited guests had become suddenly aware that the count's mother, in all her glacial stateliness, had returned among them.

And in the vast and solemn room their laughter sounded a note which struck Fauchery strangely, the note of delicate glass breaking. Assuredly here was the first beginning of the "little rift." Everyone began talking again. Mme du Joncquoy demurred; Mme Chantereau knew for certain that a marriage had been projected but that matters had gone no further; the men even ventured to give their opinions. For some minutes the conversation was a babel of opinions, in which the divers elements of the circle, whether Bonapartist or Legitimist or merely worldly and skeptical, appeared to jostle one another simultaneously. Estelle had rung to order wood to be put on the fire; the footman turned up the lamps; the room seemed to wake from sleep. Fauchery began smiling, as though once more at his ease.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_522');"><p>He referred to the chief clerk, sound asleep in the middle of the drawing room. Fauchery, afar off, amused himself by following this delicate negotiation. Vandeuvres had sat himself down by the stout man, who still looked very sedate. For some moments they both appeared to be discussing with much propriety the question before the house, which was, "How can one discover the exact state of feeling that urges a young girl to enter into the religious life?" Then the count returned with the remark:
</p></origin><translate id="div_522" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他说的胖子就是正在客厅正中间打盹的内务部办公室主任，福什利呆在远处，饶有兴致地听他们交涉。旺德夫尔坐在胖子的身边，胖子保持着一副十分庄重的神态，一会儿，他们似乎在一本正经地讨论一个悬而未决的问题，就是要弄清是什么真正的感情促使那个女孩进修道院当修女的。随后，旺德夫尔伯爵回来了，他说： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_523');"><p>"It's impossible. He swears she's straight. She'd refuse, and yet I would have wagered that I once saw her at Laure's."
</p></origin><translate id="div_523" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这不可能。他发誓说她是个正派女人。她一定不会答应……但是我敢打赌，我曾经在洛尔饭店里见过她。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_526');"><p>Then they sneered and with sparkling eyes they compared notes about the table d'hote in the Rue des Martyrs, where big Laure Piedefer ran a dinner at three francs a head for little women in difficulties. A nice hole, where all the little women used to kiss Laure on the lips! And as the Countess Sabine, who had overheard a stray word or two, turned toward them, they started back, rubbing shoulders in excited merriment. They had not noticed that Georges Hugon was close by and that he was listening to them, blushing so hotly the while that a rosy flush had spread from his ears to his girlish throat. The infant was full of shame and of ecstasy. From the moment his mother had turned him loose in the room he had been hovering in the wake of Mme de Chezelles, the only woman present who struck him as being the thing. But after all is said and done, Nana licked her to fits!
</p></origin><translate id="div_526" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是他俩冷冷一笑，眸子里闪闪发光，互相详细地谈起殉道者路的洛尔饭店里的饭菜情况。肥胖的洛尔彼尔德费尔让那些手头拮据的小娘儿们在那里就餐，每人只收三法郎。那可是个偏僻的地方！所有小娘儿们见了洛尔太太都要与她亲吻。这时，萨比娜伯爵夫人偶然听见他们一句谈话，便掉过头来，他们马上向后退了几步，两人互相推推撞撞，高兴得涨红了脸。他们居然没有发现乔治于贡就在他们旁边，偷听他们谈话，脸色变得绯红，就像一道红潮从耳根一直泛到他那姑娘般的脖子上。这个孩子感到又羞怯又高兴。自从他妈妈把他带到客厅以后，他就在谢泽勒太太的身后转来转去，他认为谢泽勒太太是客厅里唯一漂亮的女人。不过，娜娜比她还漂亮呢！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_527');"><p>"Yesterday evening," Mme Hugon was saying, "Georges took me to the play. Yes, we went to the Varietes, where I certainly had not set foot for the last ten years. That child adores music. As to me, I wasn't in the least amused, but he was so happy! They put extraordinary pieces on the stage nowadays. Besides, music delights me very little, I confess."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_528');"><p>"What! You don't love music, madame?" cried Mme du Joncquoy, lifting her eyes to heaven. "Is it possible there should be people who don't love music?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_528" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么？太太，你不喜欢音乐！”杜荣古瓦抬头仰望着天空，大声嚷道，“居然还会有人不喜欢音乐！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_529');"><p>The exclamation of surprise was general. No one had dropped a single word concerning the performance at the Varietes, at which the good Mme Hugon had not understood any of the allusions. The ladies knew the piece but said nothing about it, and with that they plunged into the realm of sentiment and began discussing the masters in a tone of refined and ecstatical admiration. Mme du Joncquoy was not fond of any of them save Weber, while Mme Chantereau stood up for the Italians. The ladies' voices had turned soft and languishing, and in front of the hearth one might have fancied one's self listening in meditative, religious retirement to the faint, discreet music of a little chapel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_529" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的话博得了大家的喝彩。但是大家对游艺剧院上演的那出戏都避而不谈，善良的于贡太太对这出戏全然不懂；这些妇女很了解这出戏，但她们都只字不提。突然，大家把话头全都转到音乐大师们的身上，她们大谈对大师们的看法，个个对他们都无限景仰，简直到了心醉神迷的地步。杜荣古瓦太太只喜欢韦伯①的作品，尚特罗太太则喜欢意大利音乐家。这时太太们的声音变得柔和、微弱起来，也许有人会说，在壁炉前边，这声音仿佛是教堂中发出的默祷，是小教堂里发出的低沉的、令人神往的赞美歌。  
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_530');"><p>"Now let's see," murmured Vandeuvres, bringing Fauchery back into the middle of the drawing room, "notwithstanding it all, we must invent a woman for tomorrow. Shall we ask Steiner about it?"

There must have been some sort of complication, for both of them, moving carefully forward and stepping over the dresses of the ladies, went off in quest of another young man with whom they continued the discussion in the embrasure of a window. Fauchery was left to himself and had just decided to proceed to the hearth, where Mme du Joncquoy was announcing that she never heard Weber played without at the same time seeing lakes, forests and sunrises over landscapes steeped in dew, when a hand touched his shoulder and a voice behind him remarked:

It looked as though he were giving out a watchword in that easy way of his. The news went round; the place of meeting was announced, while the ladies' sentimental dissertations on music served to conceal the small, feverish rumor of these recruiting operations.

Meanwhile La Faloise stopped him at every step in hopes of receiving an invitation. He ended by offering himself, and Vandeuvres engaged him in the plot at once; only he made him promise to bring Clarisse with him, and when La Faloise pretended to scruple about certain points he quieted him by the remark:

But the countess had recalled Vandeuvres and was questioning him as to the manner in which the English made tea. He often betook himself to England, where his horses ran. Then as though he had been inwardly following up quite a laborious train of thought during his remarks, he broke in with the question:

Assisted by her daughter, the countess was pouring out the tea, and as hardly any guests save intimate friends had come, the cups and the platefuls of little cakes were being circulated without ceremony. Even the ladies did not leave their armchairs in front of the fire and sat sipping their tea and nibbling cakes which they held between their finger tips. From music the talk had declined to purveyors. Boissier was the only person for sweetmeats and Catherine for ices. Mme Chantereau, however, was all for Latinville. Speech grew more and more indolent, and a sense of lassitude was lulling the room to sleep. Steiner had once more set himself secretly to undermine the deputy, whom he held in a state of blockade in the corner of a settee. M. Venot, whose teeth must have been ruined by sweet things, was eating little dry cakes, one after the other, with a small nibbling sound suggestive of a mouse, while the chief clerk, his nose in a teacup, seemed never to be going to finish its contents. As to the countess, she went in a leisurely way from one guest to another, never pressing them, indeed, only pausing a second or two before the gentlemen whom she viewed with an air of dumb interrogation before she smiled and passed on. The great fire had flushed all her face, and she looked as if she were the sister of her daughter, who appeared so withered and ungainly at her side. When she drew near Fauchery, who was chatting with her husband and Vandeuvres, she noticed that they grew suddenly silent; accordingly she did not stop but handed the cup of tea she was offering to Georges Hugon beyond them.

A man of his position did not sit down at tables of such women as that. Vandeuvres protested: it was to be a supper party of dramatic and artistic people, and talent excused everything. But without listening further to the arguments urged by Fauchery, who spoke of a dinner where the Prince of Scots, the son of a queen, had sat down beside an ex-music-hall singer, the count only emphasized his refusal. In so doing, he allowed himself, despite his great politeness, to be guilty of an irritated gesture.
</p></origin><translate id="div_569" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他脸上露出一副冷漠样子，想让他们知道，跟他开这种玩笑毫无意思，像他这样有身份的人是不会到这样的女人家里吃饭的。旺德夫尔大声说：“这是艺术家招待的夜宵，天才人物是原谅一切的。”福什利说，曾经有一次晚餐，苏格兰王子，就是王后的儿子，坐在一个在咖啡歌舞厅里当过歌手的女人旁边。伯爵对他的话压根儿不想再听下去，再三拒绝接受邀请。 虽然他是个很讲礼貌的人，还是露出气乎乎的样子。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_577');"><p>But there was a great stir in the drawing room, and Vandeuvres and Fauchery could not continue pressing the count. The Marquis de Chouard had just come in, and everyone was anxious to greet him. He had moved painfully forward, his legs failing under him, and he now stood in the middle of the room with pallid face and eyes blinking, as though he had just come out of some dark alley and were blinded by the brightness of the lamps.
</p></origin><translate id="div_577" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，客厅里骚动起来。旺德夫尔和福什利无法继续劝说伯爵了。舒阿尔侯爵进来了，大家都赶紧站起来迎接。侯爵两腿发软，步履维艰地站在客厅中央，面色苍白，两眼一眨一眨，好像刚从光线暗淡的胡同里出来，被刺眼的灯光照得睁不开眼睛。

</p></origin><translate id="div_579" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他只是看着她，一句话也不说，样子像没有听懂她的话。他的鼻子很大，在他那胡子刮得光光的脸上，鼻子像肿起来的大疙瘩；而他的下嘴唇下垂着。于贡夫人见他如此疲乏，对他既同情又怜悯，说道：

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_582');"><p>He began to pull himself together, straightening up his bent figure and passing his hand, as was his wont, over his scant gray hair, of which a few locks strayed behind his ears.
</p></origin><translate id="div_582" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的精神恢复正常了，驼着的背挺直了，用习惯的动作，把一只手放在白发上捋了捋，那稀疏的几绺鬈发在他的耳后飘拂着。

</p></origin><translate id="div_584" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵夫人截住道：

</p></origin><translate id="div_585" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我父亲在研究一项法律草案。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_586');"><p>"Yes, a projected law," he said; "exactly so, a projected law. I shut myself up for that reason. It refers to work in factories, and I was anxious for a proper observance of the Lord's day of rest. It is really shameful that the government is unwilling to act with vigor in the matter. Churches are growing empty; we are running headlong to ruin."
</p></origin><translate id="div_586" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对的，是一项法律草案，”他说，“一项法律草案，一点也不错……我一个人关起门来研究，是有关工厂的法律。但愿大家都遵守星期日的休息。政府不愿全力执行这项制度，这种做法确实不够体面。星期日教堂里阒无一人，我们正在走向灾难。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_587');"><p>Vandeuvres had exchanged glances with Fauchery. They both happened to be behind the marquis, and they were scanning him suspiciously. When Vandeuvres found an opportunity to take him aside and to speak to him about the good-looking creature he was in the habit of taking down into the country, the old man affected extreme surprise. Perhaps someone had seen him with the Baroness Decker, at whose house at Viroflay he sometimes spent a day or so. Vandeuvres's sole vengeance was an abrupt question:
</p></origin><translate id="div_587" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>旺德夫尔瞧瞧福什利。他们两人都待在侯爵的身后，他们闻到他身上有一股气味。旺德夫尔终于找到了机会，把侯爵拉到一边，问他带到乡间去的那个美人儿是谁，老头子装出诧异的样子，可能有人看见他与德克尔男爵夫人在一起，有时他到维罗弗莱去，在她家里住上几天。旺德夫尔对他搞突然袭击，这是他唯一的报复办法：

Two footmen were noiselessly removing the empty cups and the plates with cakes. In front of the hearth the ladies had re-formed and, at the same time, narrowed their circle and were chatting more carelessly than before in the languid atmosphere peculiar to the close of a party. The very room was going to sleep, and slowly creeping shadows were cast by its walls. It was then Fauchery spoke of departure. Yet he once more forgot his intention at sight of the Countess Sabine. She was resting from her cares as hostess, and as she sat in her wonted seat, silent, her eyes fixed on a log which was turning into embers, her face appeared so white and so impassable that doubt again possessed him. In the glow of the fire the small black hairs on the mole at the corner of her lip became white. It was Nana's very mole, down to the color of the hair. He could not refrain from whispering something about it in Vandeuvres's ear. Gad, it was true; the other had never noticed it before. And both men continued this comparison of Nana and the countess. They discovered a vague resemblance about the chin and the mouth, but the eyes were not at all alike. Then, too, Nana had a good-natured expression, while with the countess it was hard to decide—she might have been a cat, sleeping with claws withdrawn and paws stirred by a scarce-perceptible nervous quiver.

They had raised their voices without noticing her, and she must have overheard them. Nevertheless, she continued sitting there stiff and motionless, not a hair having lifted on her thin neck, which was that of a girl who has shot up all too quickly. Thereupon they retired three or four paces, and Vandeuvres vowed that the countess was a very honest woman. Just then voices were raised in front of the hearth. Mme du Joncquoy was saying:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_599');"><p>The Count Muffat was talking to his father-in-law and a certain serious-looking gentleman. Vandeuvres drew him away and renewed the invitation, backing it up with the information that he was to be at the supper himself. A man might go anywhere; no one could think of suspecting evil where at most there could only be curiosity. The count listened to these arguments with downcast eyes and expressionless face. Vandeuvres felt him to be hesitating when the Marquis de Chouard approached with a look of interrogation. And when the latter was informed of the question in hand and Fauchery had invited him in his turn, he looked at his son-in-law furtively. There ensued an embarrassed silence, but both men encouraged one another and would doubtless have ended by accepting had not Count Muffat perceived M. Venot's gaze fixed upon him. The little old man was no longer smiling; his face was cadaverous, his eyes bright and keen as steel.

Other men followed them, and the same phrase went round—"At midnight, at Nana's"—as they went to get their overcoats in the anteroom. Georges, who could not leave without his mother, had stationed himself at the door, where he gave the exact address. "Third floor, door on your left." Yet before going out Fauchery gave a final glance. Vandeuvres had again resumed his position among the ladies and was laughing with Leonide de Chezelles. Count Muffat and the Marquis de Chouard were joining in the conversation, while the good Mme Hugon was falling asleep open-eyed. Lost among the petticoats, M. Venot was his own small self again and smiled as of old. Twelve struck slowly in the great solemn room.

She was talking sedately with the chief clerk and seemed to be interested in that stout individual's conversation. Assuredly he must have been deceiving himself.
