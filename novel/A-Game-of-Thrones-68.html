</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6259');"><p>In the tower room at the heart of Maegor’s Holdfast, Sansa gave herself to the darkness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6259" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在梅葛楼深处的高塔房间里，珊莎将自己彻底投入黑暗。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6260');"><p>She drew the curtains around her bed, slept, woke weeping, and slept again. When she could not sleep she lay under her blankets shivering with grief. Servants came and went, bringing meals, but the sight of food was more than she could bear. The dishes piled up on the table beneath her window, untouched and spoiling, until the servants took them away again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6260" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她拉上床帘，昏沉沉地睡去，醒了便哭，哭累再睡。睡不着的时候，她蜷缩在被窝里，哀恸欲绝，颤抖不已。仆人们来了又去，为她送来一日三餐，但她一见食物就无法忍受。于是一碟碟碰都没碰的饭菜在窗边桌上越堆越高，直到后来发酸发臭，仆人将之收走为止。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6261');"><p>Sometimes her sleep was leaden and dreamless, and she woke from it more tired than when she had closed her eyes. Yet those were the best times, for when she dreamed, she dreamed of Father. Waking or sleeping, she saw him, saw the gold cloaks fling him down, saw Ser Ilyn striding forward, unsheathing Ice from the scabbard on his back, saw the moment?.?.?.?the moment when?.?.?.?she had wanted to look away, she had wanted to, her legs had gone out from under her and she had fallen to her knees, yet somehow she could not turn her head, and all the people were screaming and shouting, and her prince had smiled at her, he’d smiled and she’d felt safe, but only for a heartbeat, until he said those words, and her father’s legs?.?.?.?that was what she remembered, his legs, the way they’d jerked when Ser Ilyn?.?.?.?when the sword?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6261" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>有时候她的睡眠沉重如铅，整夜无梦，等醒来精疲力竭，甚至较合眼时更累。但那还算好的，因为她若是做梦，必定与父亲有关。或睡或醒，她眼中所见都只有他被金袍卫土按倒在地的景象，伊林爵士大跨步向他走去，一边从背上的剑鞘里抽出‘寒冰”，然后……然后……当时她只想把头转开，她真的好想把头转开，但她的双脚早巳绵软无力，于是她跪倒在地。而不知怎地，她就是无法别过头去。四周的人大吼大叫，她的白马王子刚才不是对她露出微笑么?他真的笑了，她以为一切都没事了，但只有一瞬间，接着他便说了那句话。父亲的脚……她只记得他的双脚猛烈抽搐了一下……当伊林爵士……当他的剑……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6262');"><p>Perhaps I will die too, she told herself, and the thought did not seem so terrible to her. If she flung herself from the window, she could put an end to her suffering, and in the years to come the singers would write songs of her grief. Her body would lie on the stones below, broken and innocent, shaming all those who had betrayed her. Sansa went so far as to cross the bedchamber and throw open the shutters?.?.?.?but then her courage left her, and she ran back to her bed, sobbing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6262" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我也死了算了，她对自己说，她发现这个念头一点也不可怕。假如她从窗户纵身跳下，便可结束一切苦难，多年以后，吟游诗人会歌颂她的悲伤。．她将支离破碎地倒在塔下的石板上，纯洁无瑕，令所有背叛她的人均感羞愧。珊莎几度穿过卧室，敞开窗扉……但勇气就在那时离她而去，她只能哭着跑回床上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6263');"><p>The serving girls tried to talk to her when they brought her meals, but she never answered them. Once Grand Maester Pycelle came with a box of flasks and bottles, to ask if she was ill. He felt her brow, made her undress, and touched her all over while her bedmaid held her down. When he left he gave her a potion of honeywater and herbs and told her to drink a swallow every night. She drank it all right then and went back to sleep.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6263" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>女侍送饭来时，曾试着和她说话，但她一概置之不理。有次，派席尔大学士带着一箱瓶瓶罐罐前来，询问她是否病了。他摸摸她的额头，命她宽衣，要女侍按住她手脚，他则摸辫她全身上下。临走时他留给她一罐蜂蜜和药草调成的药水，叮嘱她每晚喝一小口。她乖乖照办，然后倒头再睡。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6264');"><p>She dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair, an ominous scraping of leather on stone as a man climbed slowly toward her bedchamber, step by step. All she could do was huddle behind her door and listen, trembling, as he came closer and closer. It was Ser Ilyn Payne, she knew, coming for her with Ice in his hand, coming to take her head. There was no place to run, no place to hide, no way to bar the door. Finally the footsteps stopped and she knew he was just outside, standing there silent with his dead eyes and his long pocked face. That was when she realized she was naked. She crouched down, trying to cover herself with her hands, as her door began to swing open, creaking, the point of the greatsword poking through?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6264" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她梦见高塔楼梯上传来脚步声，一种皮革与石头摩擦的不祥之声。有人正一步一步缓缓朝她卧室走来。她所能做的只有蜷缩门后，不住地发抖，听他越来越近。她很清楚那一定是手握“寒冰”的伊林•派恩爵士，准备来取她首级。但她无路可逃，无处可躲，无法将门闩上。最后脚步声总算停了下来，她知道他就站在门外，一言不发，长长的麻子脸，一双死人眼。这时她才发觉自己浑身赤裸，赶紧趴在地上，用手遮掩身体。门缓缓打开，嘎吱作响，巨剑的尖端穿刺而进……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6265');"><p>She woke murmuring, "Please, please, I’ll be good, I’ll be good, please don’t," but there was no one to hear.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6265" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她醒来之时，嘴里还不住念叨：“求求你，求求你，我很乖的，我会听话，请你不要杀我。”但没人理会她。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6266');"><p>When they finally came for her in truth, Sansa never heard their footsteps. It was Joffrey who opened her door, not Ser Ilyn but the boy who had been her prince. She was in bed, curled up tight, her curtains drawn, and she could not have said if it was noon or midnight. The first thing she heard was the slam of the door. Then her bed hangings were yanked back, and she threw up a hand against the sudden light and saw them standing over her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6266" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等他们当真找上门的时候，珊莎却没听见脚步声。开门的并非伊林爵士，而是她曾经的白马王子乔佛里。她正在床上，缩成一团，由于床帘紧闭，分不清中午还是午夜。她首先听见门轰然摔开，紧接着帷帐被猛地扯开，她赶忙伸手，遮挡突现的强光，发现他们高高地站在床边。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6267');"><p>"You will attend me in court this afternoon," Joffrey said. "See that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed." Sandor Clegane stood at his shoulder in a plain brown doublet and green mantle, his burned face hideous in the morning light. Behind them were two knights of the Kingsguard in long white satin cloaks.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6267" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“今天下午你要跟我上朝，”乔佛里道，“快去洗澡，换衣服，打扮得有点我未婚妻的样子。”桑铎•克里冈站在他身旁，穿着一件式样简单的褐色外衣，绿色披风』6 张烧烂的脸在晨光中更显狰狞。站在二人之后的是两名御林铁卫，肩披长长的雪白锦缎披风。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6268');"><p>Sansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself. "No," she whimpered, "please?.?.?.?leave me be."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6268" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎把毯子拉至下巴，遮住身子。“不要，”她哀求，“请……请放过我吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6269');"><p>"If you won’t rise and dress yourself, my Hound will do it for you," Joffrey said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6269" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你不赶紧起来换衣服，我就叫我的狗帮你换。”乔佛里说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6270');"><p>"I beg of you, my prince?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6270" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“求求您，我的王子……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6271');"><p>"I’m king now. Dog, get her out of bed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6271" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我是国王。狗，把她拖下来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6272');"><p>Sandor Clegane scooped her up around the waist and lifted her off the featherbed as she struggled feebly. Her blanket fell to the floor. Underneath she had only a thin bedgown to cover her nakedness. "Do as you’re bid, child," Clegane said. "Dress." He pushed her toward her wardrobe, almost gently.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6272" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>桑铎•克里冈抓住她的手腕，将她自羽毛床上拎起来，任她虚弱的挣扎。毯子滑落地面，她只穿了一件薄薄的睡袍。“孩子，照他的话去做，”克里冈说，“快把衣服穿上。”他把她推向衣柜，动作竟有些温柔。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6273');"><p>Sansa backed away from them. "I did as the queen asked, I wrote the letters, I wrote what she told me. You promised you’d be merciful. Please, let me go home. I won’t do any treason, I’ll be good, I swear it, I don’t have traitor’s blood, I don’t. I only want to go home." Remembering her courtesies, she lowered her head. "As it please you," she finished weakly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6273" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎推开他们。“我照王后的要求做了，写了信，内容也都是照她的话写的。您答应我会手下留情。求求您，让我回家吧。我不会背叛你的，我会很乖、很听话，我发誓。我体内没有叛徒的血统，真的没有。我只是想回家。”想起应该注重礼节，她垂下头。“如果您高兴的话，”她有气无力地说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6274');"><p>"It does not please me," Joffrey said. "Mother says I’m still to marry you, so you’ll stay here, and you’ll obey."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6274" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我一点也不高兴。”乔佛里道，“母亲说我还是得娶你，所以你必须留在这里，而且要乖乖听话。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6275');"><p>"I don’t want to marry you," Sansa wailed. "You chopped off my father’s head!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6275" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不想嫁给你，”珊莎悲泣着说，“你砍了我父亲的头!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6276');"><p>"He was a traitor. I never promised to spare him, only that I’d be merciful, and I was. If he hadn’t been your father, I would have had him torn or flayed, but I gave him a clean death."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6276" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他是个叛徒，我从没答应饶他一命，只说会手下留情，我也真的手下留情了。他要不是你父亲，我会把他分尸剥皮，但我却让他死得干脆。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6277');"><p>Sansa stared at him, seeing him for the first time. He was wearing a padded crimson doublet patterned with lions and a cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar that framed his face. She wondered how she could ever have thought him handsome. His lips were as soft and red as the worms you found after a rain, and his eyes were vain and cruel. "I hate you," she whispered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6277" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎怔怔地望着他，这才头一次把他瞧了个清楚。他穿着绣满狮子的加衬鲜红外衣，金缕披风，高领搭配着他那张脸。她不禁纳闷自己怎么会觉得他英俊潇洒?他的嘴唇又红又软，活像雨后土中翻到的蠕虫，他的双眼则是虚妄又残忍。“我恨你。”她低声说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6278');"><p>King Joffrey’s face hardened. "My mother tells me that it isn’t fitting that a king should strike his wife. Ser Meryn."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6278" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔佛里国王脸色一凛。“母亲说国王不应该动手打妻子。马林爵士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6279');"><p>The knight was on her before she could think, yanking back her hand as she tried to shield her face and backhanding her across the ear with a gloved fist. Sansa did not remember failing, yet the next she knew she was sprawled on one knee amongst the rushes. Her head was ringing. Ser Meryn Trant stood over her, with blood on the knuckles of his white silk glove.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6279" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她还不及反应，骑士便已拉开她试图遮脸的手，抬起重拳甩了她一记耳光。珊莎不记得自己跌倒，但等她回过神来，已经单膝跪倒在草席上，头晕目眩。马林•特兰爵士矗立在她上方，白丝手套指节处有血迹。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6280');"><p>"Will you obey now, or shall I have him chastise you again?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6280" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你是乖乖听话，还是要我再让他教训你一次?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6281');"><p>Sansa’s ear felt numb. She touched it, and her fingertips came away wet and red. "I?.?.?.?as?.?.?.?as you command, my lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6281" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎的耳朵没了知觉，她伸手一摸，指尖湿湿的都是血。“我……听候您差遣，大人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6282');"><p>"Your Grace," Joffrey corrected her. "I shall look for you in court." He turned and left.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6282" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是‘陛下’。”乔佛里纠正她，“等会儿朝廷上见。”说完他转身离去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6283');"><p>Ser Meryn and Ser Arys followed him out, but Sandor Clegane lingered long enough to yank her roughly to her feet. "Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6283" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>马林爵士和亚历斯爵士随他离开，但桑铎•克里冈粗略地拉了她一把，提她起来。“小妹妹，为你自己好，照他的想法去做。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6284');"><p>"What?.?.?.?what does he want? Please, tell me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6284" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他……他想怎么样?求求您，告诉我吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6285');"><p>"He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love," the Hound rasped. "He wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way the septa taught you. He wants you to love him?.?.?.?and fear him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6285" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他想看你笑容可掬，浑身香气，当他的美丽未婚妻。”猎狗嘶声道，“他想听你背诵那套漂亮话语，就跟修女教你的一样。他想要你既爱他……又怕他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6286');"><p>After he was gone, Sansa sank back onto the rushes, staring at the wall until two of her bedmaids crept timidly into the chamber. "I will need hot water for my bath, please," she told them, "and perfume, and some powder to hide this bruise." The right side of her face was swollen and beginning to ache, but she knew Joffrey would want her to be beautiful.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6286" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他走之后，珊莎立刻又软倒在草席上，怔怔地望着墙壁出神，直到两个女侍怯怯地走进房间。“我需要沐浴，请帮我准备热水。”她告诉她们，“还有香水，以及妆粉，好遮住淤伤。”她的右半边脸整个肿了起来，隐隐作痛，但她知道乔佛里希望她打扮得漂漂亮亮的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6287');"><p>The hot water made her think of Winterfell, and she took strength from that. She had not washed since the day her father died, and she was startled at how filthy the water became. Her maids sluiced the blood off her face, scrubbed the dirt from her back, washed her hair and brushed it out until it sprang back in thick auburn curls. Sansa did not speak to them, except to give them commands; they were Lannister servants, not her own, and she did not trust them. When the time came to dress, she chose the green silk gown that she had worn to the tourney. She recalled how gallant Joff had been to her that night at the feast. Perhaps it would make him remember as well, and treat her more gently.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6287" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>热水，令她想起了临冬城，稍稍坚强起来。自从父亲死后，她就没洗过澡，这时才惊讶地发现水变得多脏。女仆为她洗去脸上的血污，刷净背上的尘土，将浆洗的头发梳成浓密的枣红发卷。除了下令，珊莎不和她们交谈：她们是兰尼斯特家的仆人，不是她自家的人，她不信任她们。穿衣服时，她特地拣了那件绿丝礼服，正是比武大会当天穿的那件。她记得那晚席间乔佛里对她有多殷勤，如果她穿上这件衣服，或许能让他联想起来，对她温柔一点。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6288');"><p>She drank a glass of buttermilk and nibbled at some sweet biscuits as she waited, to settle her stomach. It was midday when Ser Meryn returned. He had donned his white armor; a shirt of enameled scales chased with gold, a tall helm with a golden sunburst crest, greaves and gorget and gauntlet and boots of gleaming plate, a heavy wool cloak clasped with a golden lion. His visor had been removed from his helm, to better show his dour face; pouchy bags under his eyes, a wide sour mouth, rusty hair spotted with grey. "My lady," he said, bowing, as if he had not beaten her bloody only three hours past. "His Grace has instructed me to escort you to the throne room."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6288" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>打扮完毕后，她坐下等待，喝了一杯酪乳，啃下几块甜饼干，暂时止住胃里的翻腾。到马林爵士来找她时，已经日当正午。他穿上了全套纯白甲胄：精工金线白鳞甲，高顶黄金日芒盔，护膝、护喉、护手和长靴都是闪闪发光的铁铠，还有一袭厚重的羊毛披风，装饰着黄金狮扣。他的头盔除去了面罩，显露出冷峻的脸；两个大眼袋，一张宽阔而乖戾的嘴，铁锈般的头发里夹杂着几许灰白。“小姐，”他鞠躬道，仿佛不记得自己三小时前把她打得满脸是血。“陛下吩咐我护送您上朝。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6289');"><p>"Did he instruct you to hit me if I refused to come?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6289" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果我拒绝，他有没有吩咐你打我啊?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6290');"><p>"Are you refusing to come, my lady?" The look he gave her was without expression. He did not so much as glance at the bruise he had left her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6290" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小姐，您这是在拒绝么?”他看她的眼神毫无感情，对他稍早造成的淤伤无动于衷。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6291');"><p>He did not hate her, Sansa realized; neither did he love her. He felt nothing for her at all. She was only a?.?.?.?a thing to him. "No," she said, rising. She wanted to rage, to hurt him as he’d hurt her, to warn him that when she was queen she would have him exiled if he ever dared strike her again?.?.?.?but she remembered what the Hound had told her, so all she said was, "I shall do whatever His Grace commands."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6291" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎突然明白，他并不恨她，也不爱她，他对她根本一点感觉也没有。对他来说，她不过是个……东西。“不是，”她说罢起身，心中好想疯狂发怒，狠狠地揍他，就像他打她一样，她要警告他，等她当上王后，他若再敢动她一根汗毛，便将他永世放逐……但她心中依然记得猎狗的话，所以她只说：“我将谨遵陛下的旨意。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6292');"><p>"As I do," he replied.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6292" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我也是。”他回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6293');"><p>"Yes?.?.?.?but you are no true knight, Ser Meryn."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6293" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是么……可是，马林爵士，你不是真正的骑士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6294');"><p>Sandor Clegane would have laughed at that, Sansa knew. Other men might have cursed her, warned her to keep silent, even begged for her forgiveness. Ser Meryn Trant did none of these. Ser Meryn Trant simply did not care.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6294" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎矢口道，桑锋•克里冈若是听了这话，准会哈哈大笑。换做其他人，或许会咒骂她，或许会警告她闭嘴，甚或恳求她原谅，但马林•特兰爵士什么也没做，因为他根本不在乎。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6295');"><p>The balcony was deserted save for Sansa. She stood with her head bowed, fighting to hold back her tears, while below Joffrey sat on his Iron Throne and dispensed what it pleased him to call justice. Nine cases out of ten seemed to bore him; those he allowed his council to handle, squirming restlessly while Lord Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, or Queen Cersei resolved the matter. When he did choose to make a ruling, though, not even his queen mother could sway him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6295" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>除了珊莎，供旁听的楼台上空无一人。她低着头，强忍泪水，看着下面的乔佛里端坐铁王座，自以为公义地裁决国事。十件案子，有九件他觉得无聊，便把它们统统交给御前会议，自己则在宝座上焦躁不安地动来动去。贝里席伯爵、派席尔大学士和瑟曦太后忙个不停，但当国王偶而决定亲自出马时，连他的母后大人也左右不了局面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6296');"><p>A thief was brought before him and he had Ser Ilyn chop his hand off, right there in court. Two knights came to him with a dispute about some land, and he decreed that they should duel for it on the morrow. "To the death," he added. A woman fell to her knees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor. She had loved him, she said, and she wanted to see him decently buried. "If you loved a traitor, you must be a traitor too," Joffrey said. Two gold cloaks dragged her off to the dungeons.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6296" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>有个小偷被拖上来，他吩咐伊林爵士在王座厅里当场剁下他的手。两名骑士对某块地产生纷争，上朝请他定夺，他则下诏令他们明日决斗解决，并且补上一句：“至死方休。”有个女人跪地乞求一位因叛国罪而被砍头的男子的首级，她说她很爱他，希望能让他全尸下葬。“你爱叛徒，说明你也是叛徒。”乔佛里说，于是两个金袍 卫士把她拖进地牢。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6297');"><p>Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head. But a voice inside her whispered, There are no heroes, and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her, here in this very hall. "Life is not a song, sweetling," he’d told her. "You may learn that one day to your sorrow." In life, the monsters win, she told herself, and now it was the Hound’s voice she heard, a cold rasp, metal on stone. "Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6297" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>生着一张青蛙脸的史林特伯爵坐在议事桌末端，身穿黑天鹅绒外衣，肩披闪亮的金缕披风，国王每下一个判决，他就点头称是。珊莎仔细地看着他那张丑脸，想起他当时如何把父亲按倒在地，让伊林爵士斩首示众，心中只盼能狠狠地报复他，希望哪个英雄能把 “他”也按倒在地，斩首示众。但在她心底，有个声音却在低语：世上已经没有英雄了。她忆起培提尔伯爵从前在这个大厅里对她说的话，“小可爱，人生不比歌谣，”他告诉她，“有朝一日，你可能会大失所望。”看来在现实生活中，往往是怪兽得胜，她对自己说，接着她耳边又回响起猎狗那如金属和石头摩擦的冰冷嘶声：“小妹妹，为你自己好，照他想法去做。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6298');"><p>The last case was a plump tavern singer, accused of making a song that ridiculed the late King Robert. Joff commanded them to fetch his woodharp and ordered him to perform the song for the court. The singer wept and swore he would never sing that song again, but the king insisted. It was sort of a funny song, all about Robert fighting with a pig. The pig was the boar who’d killed him, Sansa knew, but in some verses it almost sounded as if he were singing about the queen. When the song was done, Joffrey announced that he’d decided to be merciful. The singer could keep either his fingers or his tongue. He would have a day to make his choice. Janos Slynt nodded.

When the herald’s voice dismissed the court, she fled the balcony, only to find Joffrey waiting for her at the base of the curving stairs. The Hound was with him, and Ser Meryn as well. The young king examined her critically, top to bottom. "You look much better than you did."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6316');"><p>From the high battlements of the gatehouse, the whole world spread out below them. Sansa could see the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s hill, where her father had died. At the other end of the Street of the Sisters stood the fire-blackened ruins of the Dragonpit. To the west, the swollen red sun was half-hidden behind the Gate of the Gods.

The heads were mounted between the crenels, along the top of the wall, impaled on iron spikes so they faced out over the city. Sansa had noted them the moment she’d stepped out onto the wallwalk, but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun were ever so much prettier. He can make me look at the heads, she told herself, but he can’t make me see them.

"I’m saving those for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly," he explained. The other heads had been dead and mounted much longer than her father. Despite the tar, most were long past being recognizable. The king pointed to one and said, "That’s your septa there," but Sansa could not even have told that it was a woman. The jaw had rotted off her face, and birds had eaten one ear and most of a cheek.
