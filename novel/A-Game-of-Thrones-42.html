</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3781');"><p>You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained," Ser Alliser Thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard. "Your hands were made for manure shovels, not for swords, and if it were up to me, the lot of you would be set to herding swine. But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad. One or two may even be worth the price of piss. To make room for them, I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will." He called out the names one by one. "Toad. Stone Head. Aurochs. Lover. Pimple. Monkey. Ser Loon." Last, he looked at Jon. "And the Bastard."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3781" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我从没见过像你们这么无可救药的小鬼。”等他们全体聚集在训练场里，艾里沙•索恩爵士说，“你们的手生来只配挑粪，没资格拿剑。若是依我之见，我会发配你们通通去养猪。可是昨晚我听说葛伦正带着五个小伙子，从国王大道上来。其中一两个或许还有救。为了给他们腾出位置，我决定放过你们其中八个，交给司令官去处置。”他一个接一个喊出名字，“癞蛤蟆、呆头、大笨牛、娘娘腔、雀斑男、猴子、蠢蛋爵士，”最后他看看琼恩，“还有野种。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3782');"><p>Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust his sword into the air. Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile stare. "They will call you men of Night’s Watch now, but you are bigger fools than the Mummer’s Monkey here if you believe that. You are boys still, green and stinking of summer, and when the winter comes you will die like flies." And with that, Ser Alliser Thorne took his leave of them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3782" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派普呼了口气，兴奋得把剑抛向空中。艾里沙爵士恶狠狠地瞪着他说：“从现在起，别人会称你们作守夜人，但如果你们信以为真，那就是天字第一号大笨蛋。你们都还是乳臭未干的小毛头，身上都是夏天味道，等冬天一来，你们就会像苍蝇一样全部死得四脚朝天。”说完艾里沙•索恩爵士便离开了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3783');"><p>The other boys gathered round the eight who had been named, laughing and cursing and offering congratulations. Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and shouted, "Toad, of the Night’s Watch!" Yelling that a black brother needed a horse, Pyp leapt onto Grenn’s shoulders, and they tumbled to the ground, rolling and punching and hooting. Dareon dashed inside the armory and returned with a skin of sour red. As they passed the wine from hand to hand, grinning like fools, Jon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by himself beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard. Jon offered him the skin. "A swallow of wine?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3783" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其他男孩立即把八个被擢升的人团团围住，又笑又骂，连声道贺。霍德用剑脊敲敲陶德的屁股，大喊：“现在你可是守夜人癞蛤蟆啦！”派普嚷着说要当黑衫军先得有坐骑，一跃跳上葛兰肩膀，两人同时扑倒，在地上翻滚打闹怪叫。戴利恩冲进武器库，回来时手中多了一袋劣等红酒。正当他们轮流喝酒，像呆瓜似地傻笑时，琼恩注意到山姆威尔•塔利孤伶伶地站在广场角落一棵光秃秃的树下。琼恩把酒袋递过去。“要不要来一口？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3784');"><p>Sam shook his head. "No thank you, Jon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3784" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆摇摇头。“不用了，琼恩，谢谢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3785');"><p>"Are you well?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3785" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你还好吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3786');"><p>"Very well, truly," the fat boy lied. "I am so happy for you all." His round face quivered as he forced a smile. "You will be First Ranger someday, just as your uncle was."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3786" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我很好，真的。”胖男孩在撒谎，“我真为你们高兴。”他试图挤出一抹微笑，结果只有那张圆脸木然地晃动。“有朝一日你一定会当上首席游骑兵，像你叔叔从前那样。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3787');"><p>"Is," Jon corrected. He would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead. Before he could say more, Haider cried, "Here, you planning to drink that all yourself?" Pyp snatched the skin from his hand and danced away, laughing. While Grenn seized his arm, Pyp gave the skin a squeeze, and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face. Haider howled in protest at the waste of good wine. Jon sputtered and struggled. Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3787" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我叔叔现在还是首席游骑兵。”琼恩纠正他。他绝不相信班扬•史塔克已死。他还来不及再说，只听霍德喊道，“好家伙，你打算独吞啊？”派普从他手中一把攫走酒袋，笑着跑开。葛兰抓住他的手，派普使劲把酒袋一捏，一股细细的红色酒柱便喷到琼恩脸上。霍德大吼着叫他别浪费好东西。琼恩含含糊糊、说不出话，挣扎着想站稳，这时梅沙和杰伦爬到墙上，开始朝他们猛扔雪球。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3788');"><p>By the time he wrenched free, with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat, Samwell Tarly had gone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3788" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等他挣脱开来，满头是雪，衣服上也都是葡萄酒，山姆威尔•塔利已经走了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3789');"><p>That night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion. When Jon arrived at the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led him to the bench near the fire. The older men clapped him on the arm in passing. The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs, garnished with sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter. "From the Lord Commander’s own table," Bowen Marsh told them. There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3789" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当晚，三指哈布为庆祝男孩们的晋升，特别煮了顿丰盛晚餐。琼恩走进大厅时，总务长亲自领他前往靠近火炉的座位，途中老鸟们纷纷拍他表示嘉许。八个即将成为黑衣弟兄的男孩品尝了薄荷叶装饰、用大蒜和药草烤的羊肉，以及浸在奶油里的黄萝卜泥。“这可是总司令的餐桌上才有的好东西。”波文•马尔锡告诉他们。除此之外，桌上还有用菠菜、鹰嘴豆和芜菁做的凉拌沙拉，饭后甜点则是冰镇的蓝莓和甜奶油。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3790');"><p>"Do you think they’ll keep us together?" Pyp wondered as they gorged themselves happily.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3790" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你觉得他们会把我们编在一起吗？”当他们开心地狼吞虎咽时，派普不禁问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3791');"><p>Toad made a face. "I hope not. I’m sick of looking at those ears of yours."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3791" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>陶德扮了个鬼脸。“希望不会，我受够了你那双丑耳朵。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3792');"><p>"Ho," said Pyp. "Listen to the crow call the raven black. You’re certain to be a ranger, Toad. They’ll want you as far from the castle as they can. If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face, and he’ll run off screaming."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3792" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哟，”派普说，“天下乌鸦还不是一般黑。癞蛤蟆，我看你游骑兵是当定了，因为他们会把你派得离城堡越远越好。若是曼斯•雷德打来，只需掀开面罩，叫他们瞧瞧你那张脸，保管他们落荒而逃啊。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3793');"><p>Everyone laughed but Grenn. "I hope I’m a ranger."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3793" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>除了葛兰，大家哄堂而笑。“我真心希望自己能当游骑兵呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3794');"><p>"You and everyone else," said Matthar. Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night’s Watch. It was they who dared ride beyond the Wall, sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower, fighting wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3794" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们不都一样。”梅沙道。黑衫军的每一位成员都有防守长城之责，若是敌人来袭，人人都必须举剑迎敌，然而游骑兵才是守夜人部队中真正的战斗主力。只有他们会骑马北出长城，扫荡影子塔以西鬼影幢幢的森林和冰雪覆盖的崇山峻岭，与野人、巨人和怪物般的雪熊作战。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3795');"><p>"Not everyone," said Halder. "It’s the builders for me. What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3795" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那可不一定，”霍德说，“我就想当工匠。若是长城垮了，游骑兵还有什么用呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3796');"><p>The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers, the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the Wall. Once, it was said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest, dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher. Those days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all they could do to ride the Wall from Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs they could.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3796" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>工匠群体包括负责维修堡垒和塔楼的石匠和木匠；负责挖掘隧道，敲碎石头铺路的矿工；负责砍伐靠近长城的树林的樵夫。据说多年以前，工匠们从鬼影森林中的冰湖运来巨大冰块，用雪橇南运，以将长城砌高。然而距离那样的年代，已经过了好几百年，如今他们所能做的，便只是沿着城墙，从东海望走到影子塔，修补沿途的裂缝，注意融化的迹象。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3797');"><p>"The Old Bear’s no fool," Dareon observed. "You’re certain to be a builder, and Jon’s certain to be a ranger. He’s the best sword and the best rider among us, and his uncle was the First before he?.?.?.?" His voice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had almost said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3797" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“熊老可不是笨蛋，”戴利恩发表意见，“你一定会当上工匠，而琼恩也一定会当上游骑兵。咱们这群人里面他不仅剑使得最好，骑术也最棒，更何况他叔叔生前也是首……”他想起自己提到了什么，不自在地住嘴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3798');"><p>"Benjen Stark is still First Ranger," Jon Snow told him, toying with his bowl of blueberries. The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle’s safe return, but not him. He pushed away the berries, scarcely touched, and rose from the bench.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3798" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“班扬•史塔克依旧是首席游骑兵。”琼恩•雪诺一边把玩着手中那碗蓝莓，一边对他说。别人或许对叔叔安然归来不抱期望，但他不会。他推开几乎碰都没碰的蓝莓，起身离开长凳。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3799');"><p>"Aren’t you going to eat those?" Toad asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3799" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这些你还要不要？”陶德问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3800');"><p>"They’re yours." Jon had hardly tasted Hobb’s great feast. "I could not eat another bite." He took his cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way out.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3800" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“都给你。”事实上，连哈布精心烹调的晚餐，琼恩也几乎没动。“我吃不下了。”他从门边的挂勾上取下斗篷，穿了就准备出去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3801');"><p>Pyp followed him. "Jon, what is it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3801" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派普跟上来。“琼恩，怎么了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3802');"><p>"Sam," he admitted. "He was not at table tonight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3802" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是山姆，”他承认，“今晚他没上桌。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3803');"><p>"It’s not like him to miss a meal," Pyp said thoughtfully. "Do you suppose he’s taken ill?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3803" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这家伙可不像是会错过餐点的人，”派普若有所思地说，“你觉得他生病了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3804');"><p>"He’s frightened. We’re leaving him." He remembered the day he had left Winterfell, all the bittersweet farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in his hair, Arya raining kisses on him after he’d given her Needle. "Once we say our words, we’ll all have duties to attend to. Some of us may be sent away, to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower. Sam will remain in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad. Gods only know what they’ll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him, first chance he gets."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3804" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他在害怕。因为我们就要离开他了。”他忆起自己离开临冬城当天，那些悲喜交加的道别。布兰支离破碎地躺在床上，罗柏发际还有雪花，艾莉亚则是得到“缝衣针”后疯狂地吻他。“等我们宣过誓，就会有各自应尽的义务。有些人可能被派往远方，前往东海望或影子塔。只有山姆会留下来继续受训，而雷斯特或库格那种人正在国王大道上等着他。天知道他们是什么德行，不过可以肯定艾里沙爵士一有机会就会叫他们去对付他。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3805');"><p>Pyp made a grimace. "You did all you could."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3805" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派普皱眉：“能做的你都做了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3806');"><p>"All we could wasn’t enough," Jon said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3806" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们做的还不够。”琼恩说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3807');"><p>A deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin’s Tower for Ghost. The direwolf walked beside him to the stables. Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered. Jon saddled his mare, mounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night. Ghost raced ahead of him, flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye. Jon let him go. A wolf needed to hunt.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3807" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他回哈丁塔找白灵时，心中感到深切的不安。冰原狼跟在他身边走向马厩，刚一进门，几匹比较激动的马便伸腿踢栏，两耳后竖。琼恩为他的母马上鞍，骑出黑城堡，就着月光和夜色往南行去。白灵飞奔在前，转眼便消失无踪。琼恩由他去，狼总有打猎的本能。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3808');"><p>He had no destination in mind. He wanted only to ride. He followed the creek for a time, listening to the icy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to the kingsroad. It stretched out before him, narrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of it filled Jon Snow with a vast longing. Winterfell was down that road, and beyond it Riverrun and King’s Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock, the Isle of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria. All the places that Jon would never see. The world was down that road?.?.?.?and he was here.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3808" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的脑中漫无目的，纯粹只想骑马。他先是沿溪而行，聆听冰冷的溪水流过岩石，接着穿越旷野，踏上国王大道。道路在眼前伸展，狭窄、多石、杂草从生，看上去并非通往光明与希望的途径。然而这道路，却让琼恩•雪诺心里盈满思慕之情。临冬城就在路上某地，如果继续前行，则会抵达奔流城、君临、鹰巢城和其他许多地方，例如凯岩城、千面屿，多恩领的红色山脉，海中布拉佛斯的百余列岛，瓦雷西亚浓烟滚滚的古老废墟。这些地方琼恩永远不能得见。世界在路的彼端……而他却在这里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3809');"><p>Once he swore his vow, the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon. "I have not sworn yet," he muttered. He was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes. He had come here freely, and he might leave freely?.?.?.?until he said the words. He need only ride on, and he could leave it all behind. By the time the moon was full again, he would be back in Winterfell with his brothers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3809" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一旦他发下誓言，便将以此为家，在此终老，和伊蒙师傅一样。“我还没发誓呢。”他喃喃自语。他并非违法乱纪之人，不像他们若不穿上黑衣，便得接受法律臸裁。他以自由之身来到这里，同样也可以自由之身离去……除非他开口宣誓。他只需继续骑行，便可抛开这里的一切。等到新月再度满盈，他已经返回临冬城，与兄弟重新团聚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3810');"><p>Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King’s Landing either. Even his own mother had not had a place for him. The thought of her made him sad. He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her?
</p></origin><translate id="div_3810" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们是你同父异母的兄弟，心中有一个声音在提醒他。还有不欢迎你的史塔克夫人。临冬城里无他容身之地，更不用说君临。连他自己的母亲也无法安顿他。想到她，他不禁难过起来。他想知道她是谁，长什么样，想知道父亲为何离开她。白痴，因为她是个妓女，要不然就是个有夫之妇。一定是牵连到某些阴暗又不名誉的事，否则艾德大人为何羞于提及？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3811');"><p>Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him. The fires of Castle Black were hidden behind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the moon, vast and cold, running from horizon to horizon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3811" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩•雪诺将视线从国王大道转开，回头往后看去。黑城堡的灯火被一座小丘遮蔽，但巨大而冷漠的长城，却在月光照耀下直向天际，清晰可见。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3812');"><p>He wheeled his horse around and started for home.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3812" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他调转马头，朝家的方向奔去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3813');"><p>Ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander’s Tower. The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the horse. Jon found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back. By the time he reached the stables, he knew what he must do.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3813" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他刚爬过缓丘，瞧见远处司令塔的火光，白灵便回来了。冰原狼的口鼻一片血红，缓步跟在马旁边。在回去的路上，琼恩发现自己再度想起了山姆威尔•塔利。等他回到马厩，心里已有了主意。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3814');"><p>Maester Aemon’s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery. Aged and frail, the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards, who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties. The brothers joked that he had been given the two ugliest men in the Night’s Watch; being blind, he was spared having to look at them. Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink eyes like a mole. Chett had a wen on his neck the size of a pigeon’s egg, and a face red with boils and pimples. Perhaps that was why he always seemed so angry.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3814" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊蒙学士的居所在一座坚固的木造堡垒内，正好位于鸦巢下方。学士年纪大了，身体也虚弱，因此他和两个负责照顾他起居，平时则协助他处理事务的年轻事务官住在一起。兄弟们间有个笑话，说全守夜人部队里最丑的两个都给派到他手下，只因为他瞎了眼，省得受罪。克莱达斯矮个子，秃头，几乎没下巴，长了一双粉红色的小眼睛，活像只鼹鼠。齐特脖子上长了个鸽子蛋那么大的瘤，脸上则布满疮和疙瘩。或许正因如此，无论何时他看起来总是怒气冲冲。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3815');"><p>It was Chett who answered Jon’s knock. "I need to speak to Maester Aemon," Jon told him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3815" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>来应门的是齐特。“我有事找伊蒙师傅。”琼恩告诉他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3816');"><p>"The maester is abed, as you should be. Come back on the morrow and maybe he’ll see you." He began to shut the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3816" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“学士已经睡啦，你也该上床了。明天再来看他愿不愿见你罢。”说完他准备关门。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3817');"><p>Jon jammed it open with his boot. "I need to speak to him now. The morning will be too late."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3817" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩伸脚卡住门。“我现在就要跟他谈，等明早就太迟了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3818');"><p>Chett scowled. "The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night. Do you know how old he is?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3818" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>齐特皱眉道：“学士可不习惯没事给人半夜吵醒。你知道他年纪多大了吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3819');"><p>"Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you," Jon said. "Give him my pardons. I would not disturb his rest if it were not important."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3819" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道他年纪大，比你更懂待客之道。”琼恩说，“请代我向他致歉，若非情况紧急，我决不会打扰他休息的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3820');"><p>"And if I refuse?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3820" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果我拒绝呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3821');"><p>Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door. "I can stand here all night if I must."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3821" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩把脚稳稳地卡在门缝间。“我可以就这样站上整夜。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3822');"><p>The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him. "Wait in the library. There’s wood. Start a fire. I won’t have the maester catching a chill on account of you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3822" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>黑衣弟兄嫌恶地哼了一声，然后打开门让他进去。“到图书室去等。那边有木材，去生个火。我可不会让学士因为你的关系着凉。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3823');"><p>Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon. The old man was clad in his bed robe, but around his throat was the chain collar of his order. A maester did not remove it even to sleep. "The chair beside the fire would be pleasant," he said when he felt the warmth on his face. When he was settled comfortably, Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3823" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等齐特领着伊蒙师傅进来，琼恩已经生起一炉劈啪作响的柴火。老人穿着睡袍，颈间依然挂着象征身份的锁链。即便睡觉，学士也不能取下。“我坐炉边那张椅子就好。”他大概是察觉到暖意，便这么说。等他舒服地坐下，齐特拿了张毛皮帮他盖住双脚，然后走到门边站定。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3824');"><p>"I am sorry to have woken you, Maester," Jon Snow said.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3825');"><p>"You did not wake me," Maester Aemon replied. "I find I need less sleep as I grow older, and I am grown very old. I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday. The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion. So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come calling at this strange hour?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3825" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你并没有吵醒我，”伊蒙师傅回答，“我发现年纪越大，睡眠的需求就越少，而我已经很老了。我时常大半夜与过去的鬼魂为伍，回忆起五十年前的往事，恍如昨日。因此三更半夜的神秘访客，也算件不错的事。那么告诉我，琼恩•雪诺，这时候跑来找我，究竟有什么事？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3826');"><p>"To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night’s Watch."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3826" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想请您让山姆威尔•塔利结束训练，正式加入守夜人弟兄的行列。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3827');"><p>"This is no concern of Maester Aemon," Chett complained.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3827" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那不干伊蒙学士的事。”齐特抱怨。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3828');"><p>"Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne," the maester said gently. "Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow, as you surely know. Why then come to me?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3828" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“总司令把训练新兵的事务交给艾里沙•索恩爵士负责，”师傅温和地说，“只有他才能决定某个孩子够不够格宣誓加入，这你想必也清楚。你为什么还来找我？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3829');"><p>"The Lord Commander listens to you," Jon told him. "And the wounded and the sick of the Night’s Watch are in your charge."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3829" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“因为总司令会听从您的建议，”琼恩告诉他，“更何况守夜人弟兄若有病痛伤患，也都由您照料。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3830');"><p>"And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3830" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这么说来，你这位山姆威尔•塔利可有病痛伤患？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3831');"><p>"He will be," Jon promised, "unless you help."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3831" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他很快就会有，”琼恩向他保证，“除非您能伸出援手。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3832');"><p>He told them all of it, even the part where he’d set Ghost at Rast’s throat. Maester Aemon listened silently, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett’s face darkened with each word. "Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance," Jon finished. "He’s hopeless with a sword. My sister Arya could tear him apart, and she’s not yet ten. If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it’s only a matter of time before he’s hurt or killed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3832" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他一五一十地把事情真相说出来，连放白灵去对付雷斯特的部分也没漏掉。伊蒙师傅静静地倾听，盲昧的双眼朝向炉火，然而齐特的眼神却随着他说的每一个字越显阴沉。“没有我们保护，山姆绝对撑不下去。”琼恩收了尾，“他对舞刀弄剑一窍不通。连我妹妹艾莉亚都能把他大卸八块，而她还不满十岁。假如艾里沙爵士强迫他打斗，他早晚会受伤，甚至被杀。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3833');"><p>Chett could stand no more. "I’ve seen this fat boy in the common hall," he said. "He is a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3833" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>齐特听不下去了。“我在大厅里见过这肥小子，”他说，“他分明就是条猪，如果你说的是实话，那他还是个无可救药的胆小鬼。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3834');"><p>"Maybe it is so," Maester Aemon said. "Tell me, Chett, what would you have us do with such a boy?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3834" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“或许真是如此，”伊蒙师傅道，“齐特，你倒是说说，我们该拿这孩子怎么办？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3835');"><p>"Leave him where he is," Chett said. "The Wall is no place for the weak. Let him train until he is ready, no matter how many years that takes. Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3835" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别理他，”齐特说，“长城本来就不是软脚虾该来的地方。就让他继续受训，直到他够格为止，管他要训练多少年。老天有眼，艾里沙爵士要嘛把他变成个男人，不然就把他杀掉。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3836');"><p>"That’s stupid," Jon said. He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts. "I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3836" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这种作法太愚蠢了，”琼恩道。他深吸一口气，稍稍整理思绪。“记得我曾听鲁温师傅解释过他为什么要始终戴着颈链。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3837');"><p>Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly, his bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links. "Go on."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3837" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊蒙师傅伸出骨瘦如柴，满是皱纹的手指轻抚着他沉重的项圈。“继续说。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3838');"><p>"He told me that a maester’s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve," Jon said, remembering. "I asked why each link was a different metal. A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said. Maester Luwin laughed. A maester forges his chain with study, he told me. The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft. And he said there were other meanings as well. The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn’t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can’t make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like. A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3838" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他告诉我学士的颈链是用来提醒自己立下的誓言，”琼恩边回忆边说，“然后我追问他为什么每个环节都要用不同的金属，我说如果换成银链，搭配他的灰袍一定更出彩。鲁温师傅笑着告诉我：锁链乃是随着学士的知识渐长而逐一打造。不同的金属，代表不同领域的知识，黄金代表财务会计，白银象征救死扶伤，钢铁则是军事知识。他说除此之外，锁链还有别的意义。戴着锁链，可以随时提醒学士所服务的王国，对不对？想想看，如果说贵族老爷是黄金，骑士是钢铁，但光这两个金属环无法连成一条锁链，你还需要白银、铁和铅，锡、红铜和青铜，以及其他金属，他们象征着农夫、工匠等等各行各业的人。一条锁链需要各种金属，正如一个国家需要形形色色的人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3839');"><p>Maester Aemon smiled. "And so?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3839" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊蒙师傅微笑道：“所以呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3840');"><p>"The Night’s Watch needs all sorts too. Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll couldn’t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won’t either. You can’t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn’t mean tin is useless. Why shouldn’t Sam be a steward?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3840" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“守夜人也是如此，不然干嘛区分游骑兵、事务官和工匠呢？蓝道大人无法把山姆训练成战士，艾里沙爵士也不会有办法。无论你多用力，也不能把锡打成铁，但这不代表锡就没用。为什么不让山姆当个事务官呢？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3841');"><p>Chett gave an angry scowl. "I’m a steward. You think it’s easy work, fit for cowards? The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive. We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals. Who do you think makes your clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The stewards."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3841" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>齐特愤怒地绷着脸道：“我自己就是个事务官，你以为这是轻松差事，可以随便拿给胆小鬼做？守夜人日子过得下去，全靠我们事务官打猎种田、养马养牛，还有捡柴烧饭。你以为你穿的衣服是谁缝的？补给品又是谁从南方运来的？告诉你，通通是事务官。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3842');"><p>Maester Aemon was gentler. "Is your friend a hunter?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3842" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊蒙师傅的反应比较温和。“你这位朋友打猎技术如何？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3843');"><p>"He hates hunting," Jon had to admit.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3843" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他痛恨打猎。”琼恩不得不承认。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3844');"><p>"Can he plow a field?" the maester asked. "Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could he butcher a cow?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3844" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那他会犁田吗？”学士问：“他能驾车开船吗？会不会杀牛呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3845');"><p>"No."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3845" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“都不会。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3846');"><p>Chett gave a nasty laugh. "I’ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they’re put to work. Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed. Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their own foot."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3846" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>齐特阴险地笑道：“我见过像他这种软弱的小少爷被派去做事时是什么德行。叫他们搅个奶油，就弄得皮破血流。叫他们拿斧头劈柴，就把自己的脚给砍了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3847');"><p>"I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3847" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道有件事山姆做得比谁都好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3848');"><p>"Yes?" Maester Aemon prompted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3848" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是什么？”伊蒙学士提问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3849');"><p>Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry. "He could help you," he said quickly. "He can do sums, and he knows how to read and write. I know Chett can’t read, and Clydas has weak eyes. Sam read every book in his father’s library. He’d be good with the ravens too. Animals seem to like him. Ghost took to him straight off. There’s a lot he could do, besides fighting. The Night’s Watch needs every man. Why kill one, to no end? Make use of him instead."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3849" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩警觉地看看站在门边，面疮发红，满脸怒意的齐特。“他可以帮您的忙，”他很快地说， 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3850');"><p>Maester Aemon closed his eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep. Finally he said, "Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow. Your mind is as deft as your blade, it would seem."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3850" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他懂算术，也会读书写字。我知道齐特不识字，克莱达斯眼睛又不好。山姆把他父亲的藏书都读辫了。他跟乌鸦应该会处得来，动物似乎都很喜欢他，白灵一见他就对他很有好感。除了打架，他能做的事很多。守夜人军团需要每一种人，何苦不为什么就杀掉一个呢？不如知人善任。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3851');"><p>"Does that mean?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3851" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊蒙学士闭上眼睛，琼恩一时还担心他睡着，但最后他开了口：“琼恩•雪诺，鲁温学士把你调教得很好。看来你的心思和你的剑一样灵敏。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3852');"><p>"It means I shall think on what you have said," the maester told him firmly. "And now, I believe I am ready to sleep. Chett, show our young brother to the door."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3852" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您的意思是……？” “我会仔细想想你的话，”学士语气坚定地告诉他，“现在嘛，我准备睡了。齐特，送这位年轻弟兄出去。”
