</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4093');"><p>Pain is a gift from the gods, Lord Eddard," Grand Maester Pycelle told him. "It means the bone is knitting, the flesh healing itself. Be thankful."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4093" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“艾德大人，痛觉是天上诸神的恩赐啊，”派席尔大学士告诉他，“这代表骨头正在逐渐接合，伤口也快要痊愈，您该心存感激才是。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4094');"><p>"I will be thankful when my leg stops throbbing."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4094" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“等何时我脚不痛了，再来感激也不迟。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4095');"><p>Pycelle set a stoppered flask on the table by the bed. "The milk of the poppy, for when the pain grows too onerous."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4095" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔把塞上瓶盖的药罐放在床边的桌上。“这是罂粟花奶，痛得太厉害的时候喝。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4096');"><p>"I sleep too much already."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4096" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我已经睡得太多。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4097');"><p>"Sleep is the great healer."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4097" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“睡眠是最好的医生。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4098');"><p>"I had hoped that was you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4098" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我以为好医生是你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4099');"><p>Pycelle smiled wanly. "It is good to see you in such a fierce humor, my lord." He leaned close and lowered his voice. "There was a raven this morning, a letter for the queen from her lord father. I thought you had best know."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4099" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔满脸倦容地微笑。“大人，很高兴看到您还这么幽默。”他靠过来低声说，“今天早上来了只渡鸦，带来王后她父亲大人的信。我想最好让您知道。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4100');"><p>"Dark wings, dark words," Ned said grimly. "What of it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4100" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“黑色的翅膀，黑色的消息。”奈德阴沉地说：“信上怎么说？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4101');"><p>"Lord Tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after Ser Gregor Clegane," the maester confided. "I feared he would be. You will recall, I said as much in council."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4101" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“泰温大人对您派人去逮捕格雷果•克里冈一事极为愤慨。”大学士悄声对他说，“这正好印证我的担心，您应该记得，当初我在朝廷上也提醒过您。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4102');"><p>"Let him be wroth," Ned said. Every time his leg throbbed, he remembered Jaime Lannister’s smile, and Jory dead in his arms. "Let him write all the letters to the queen he likes. Lord Beric rides beneath the king’s own banner. If Lord Tywin attempts to interfere with the king’s justice, he will have Robert to answer to. The only thing His Grace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4102" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“让他去愤慨。”奈德说。每当他脚伤抽痛，他便会想起詹姆•兰尼斯特的微笑，以及乔里死在他怀中的景况。“他爱写什么给王后是他的事。贝里伯爵打的是国王的旗号，执行的是国王的律法，要是泰温大人敢插手干预，那他就得向劳勃负责。如果说这世上还有什么比打猎更能吸引陛下，莫过于率军讨伐违抗命令的臣下了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4103');"><p>Pycelle pulled back, his maester’s chain jangling. "As you say. I shall visit again on the morrow." The old man hurriedly gathered up his things and took his leave. Ned had little doubt that he was bound straight for the royal apartments, to whisper at the queen. I thought you had best know, indeed?.?.?.?as if Cersei had not instructed him to pass along her father’s threats. He hoped his response rattled those perfect teeth of hers. Ned was not near as confident of Robert as he pretended, but there was no reason Cersei need know that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4103" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔抽回身子，脖子上的锁链吭啷作响。“如您所言。我明天再来看看。”老人收拾东西很快离去。奈德想也知道他八成会直奔王家居室，把他的反应通报王后。好个“我想最好让您知道”……说得一副瑟曦没有特别吩咐他把她父亲的恐吓说出来似的。他希望自己的回答能让她咬牙切齿。实际上奈德对劳勃并不如他表面上显示的那么有信心，但没必要让瑟曦知道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4104');"><p>When Pycelle was gone, Ned called for a cup of honeyed wine. That clouded the mind as well, yet not as badly. He needed to be able to think. A thousand times, he asked himself what Jon Arryn might have done, had he lived long enough to act on what he’d learned. Or perhaps he had acted, and died for it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4104" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔走后，奈德要来一杯掺蜂蜜的酒。这东西喝了同样会干扰神臹，却没那么严重。他必须保持思绪明晰。他问过自己一千辫：假如琼恩•艾林得知真相后没被人害死，他接下来会采取什么行动？话说回来，说不定他采取过行动，却因此而丧命。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4105');"><p>It was queer how sometimes a child’s innocent eyes can see things that grown men are blind to. Someday, when Sansa was grown, he would have to tell her how she had made it all come clear for him. He’s not the least bit like that old drunken king, she had declared, angry and unknowing, and the simple truth of it had twisted inside him, cold as death. This was the sword that killed Jon Arryn, Ned thought then, and it will kill Robert as well, a slower death but full as certain. Shattered legs may heal in time, but some betrayals fester and poison the soul.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4105" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说来奇怪，有时候孩子无知的眼睛，反而能看到成年人视而不见的事实。总有一天，等珊莎长大，他一定要告诉她，她的一句话是如何为他拨开了重重疑云。她在一无所知的情况下，说出“他一点都不像那酒鬼国王”这句气话，单纯的真相顿时在他胸口翻涌，冰冷一如死亡。这就是杀死琼恩•艾林的那把剑，当时奈德便想，这把剑同样也会杀死劳勃，或许比较慢，但绝对是迟早的事。断腿终会愈合，然而某些背叛却会逐渐腐蚀灵魂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4106');"><p>Littlefinger came calling an hour after the Grand Maester had left, clad in a plum-colored doublet with a mockingbird embroidered on the breast in black thread, and a striped cloak of black and white. "I cannot visit long, my lord," he announced. "Lady Tanda expects me to lunch with her. No doubt she will roast me a fatted calf. If it’s near as fatted as her daughter, I’m like to rupture and die. And how is your leg?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4106" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国师离开后不到一小时，小指头身穿胸前用黑线绣有仿声鸟的李子色外衣，披着黑白相间的条纹披风前来造访。“大人，我不能久留，”他进门便说，“坦妲伯爵夫人等着我共进午餐，想必会特地为我烤只肥牛。呵，如果那只牛跟她女儿一样肥，我吃了八成会活活胀死。您的脚可还好？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4107');"><p>"Inflamed and painful, with an itch that is driving me mad."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4107" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“又痛又痒，快把我逼疯了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4108');"><p>Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow. "In future, try not to let any horses fall on it. I would urge you to heal quickly. The realm grows restive. Varys has heard ominous whispers from the west. Freeriders and sellswords have been flocking to Casterly Rock, and not for the thin pleasure of Lord Tywin’s conversation."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4108" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头抬起一边眉毛。“从今往后，没事别让马压到。我劝你赶紧好起来，国内情势越来越不安定。瓦里斯听到不少从西边传来的坏消息，流浪武士和自由骑手正朝凯岩城蜂拥而去，他们可不是和泰温大人聊天去的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4109');"><p>"Is there word of the king?" Ned demanded. "Just how long does Robert intend to hunt?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4109" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“国王那边有消息吗？”奈德问，“劳勃到底要打猎到什么时候？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4110');"><p>"Given his preferences, I believe he’d stay in the forest until you and the queen both die of old age," Lord Petyr replied with a faint smile. "Lacking that, I imagine he’ll return as soon as he’s killed something. They found the white hart, it seems?.?.?.?or rather, what remained of it. Some wolves found it first, and left His Grace scarcely more than a hoof and a horn. Robert was in a fury, until he heard talk of some monstrous boar deeper in the forest. Then nothing would do but he must have it. Prince Joffrey returned this morning, with the Royces, Ser Balon Swann, and some twenty others of the party. The rest are still with the king."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4110" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“若是依他的意，我想他会待在森林里，等你和王后都老死了才回来。”培提尔浅浅一笑。 “既然这不可能，大概等杀到猎物他就会回来罢。他们找到了那只白鹿……噢，应该说找到了白鹿的残骸。有些狼捷足先登，只留给国王陛下一只鹿蹄和一只鹿角。劳勃气坏了，随后他听说森林深处有只怪物般的大熊，这时怎么也拦不住他啦。乔佛里王子，罗伊斯家的人，巴隆•史文，以及其他二十几号人今早上回来了。其他人陪着国王继续打猎。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4111');"><p>"The Hound?" Ned asked, frowning. Of all the Lannister party, Sandor Clegane was the one who concerned him the most, now that Ser Jaime had fled the city to join his father.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4111" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“猎狗呢？”奈德皱眉问。眼下詹姆爵士业已逃出城去和他父亲会师，兰尼斯特家的人里面，就数桑铎•克里冈最教他担心。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4112');"><p>"Oh, returned with Joffrey, and went straight to the queen." Littlefinger smiled. "I would have given a hundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned that Lord Beric was off to behead his brother."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4112" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喔，他跟乔佛里一道回来，他们直接奔王后那儿去了。”小指头微笑，“等他知道贝里大人带兵去杀他老哥的时候，我宁可花一百枚银鹿变成草丛里的蟑螂。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4113');"><p>"Even a blind man could see the Hound loathed his brother."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4113" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就算瞎子也看得出猎狗恨透他哥哥。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4114');"><p>"Ah, but Gregor was his to loathe, not yours to kill. Once Dondarrion lops the summit off our Mountain, the Clegane lands and incomes will pass to Sandor, but I wouldn’t hold my water waiting for his thanks, not that one. And now you must forgive me. Lady Tanda awaits with her fatted calves."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4114" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是啊，可是格雷果也只有他能恨，轮不到你杀。待唐德利恩削平魔山的山峰，克里冈家族的领地与税赋自然会传给桑铎，但别奢望他跟你道谢啦，绝对不会。抱歉，我真的该走了，坦妲伯爵夫人和她的肥牛还等着我呢。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4115');"><p>On the way to the door, Lord Petyr spied Grand Maester Malleon’s massive tome on the table and paused to idly flip open the cover. "The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children," he read. "Now there is tedious reading if ever I saw it. A sleeping potion, my lord?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4115" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>还没到门边，培提尔瞥见桌上那本梅利恩国师的厚重巨著，便停下来，随意翻开封面。“《七国主要贵族之世家谱系与历史（内附许多关于爵爷夫人和他们子女的描述）》，”他念道，“这可真是我见过的最无聊的东西了。大人，敢情您用这来帮助入眠？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4116');"><p>For a brief moment Ned considered telling him all of it, but there was something in Littlefinger’s japes that irked him. The man was too clever by half, a mocking smile never far from his lips. "Jon Arryn was studying this volume when he was taken sick," Ned said in a careful tone, to see how he might respond.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4116" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>有那么一瞬间，奈德犹豫要不要把实情告诉他，但小指头的玩笑令他生厌。这家伙老是自以为机灵，那抹促狭的微笑从来不离唇边。“琼恩•艾林生病时读的就是这本书。”奈德谨慎地说，打算试探对方的反应。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4117');"><p>And he responded as he always did: with a quip. "In that case," he said, "death must have come as a blessed relief." Lord Petyr Baelish bowed and took his leave.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4117" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他果然一如既往地耍了个嘴皮子。“若是这样，”他说，“那死还真算得上解脱。”语毕培提尔•贝里席伯爵鞠躬离去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4118');"><p>Eddard Stark allowed himself a curse. Aside from his own retainers, there was scarcely a man in this city he trusted. Littlefinger had concealed Catelyn and helped Ned in his inquiries, yet his haste to save his own skin when Jaime and his swords had come out of the rain still rankled. Varys was worse. For all his protestations of loyalty, the eunuch knew too much and did too little. Grand Maester Pycelle seemed more Cersei’s creature with every passing day, and Ser Barristan was an old man, and rigid. He would tell Ned to do his duty.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4118" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾德•史塔克容许自己咒骂了一句。除了自己的手下，城里无人可以信任。小指头虽曾帮忙藏匿凯特琳，也协助奈德明查暗访，然而当詹姆和他手下出现时，他那幅急于自保的嘴脸，至今依旧历历如绘。瓦里斯更糟。他成天强调自己忠心耿耿，事实上他知道的太多，真正去做的却太少。派席尔国师越看越像瑟曦的走狗，巴利斯坦爵士则年事已高，又食古不化，多半会告诉奈德管好份内之事即可。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4119');"><p>Time was perilously short. The king would return from his hunt soon, and honor would require Ned to go to him with all he had learned. Vayon Poole had arranged for Sansa and Arya to sail on the Wind Witch out of Braavos, three days hence. They would be back at Winterfell before the harvest. Ned could no longer use his concern for their safety to excuse his delay.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4119" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>时间异常紧迫，待国王游猎归来，出于荣誉，奈德非得向他吐露实情不可。维扬•普尔已经安排好珊莎和艾莉亚三天后搭乘布拉佛斯的风之巫女号离开，奈德再也无法以她们的安危作为自己拖延的借口。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4120');"><p>Yet last night he had dreamt of Rhaegar’s children. Lord Tywin had laid the bodies beneath the Iron Throne, wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard. That was clever of him; the blood did not show so badly against the red cloth. The little princess had been barefoot, still dressed in her bed gown, and the boy?.?.?.?the boy?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4120" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而昨夜他却梦见了雷加的孩子。泰温公爵将尸首用他侍卫的红披风裹好，放在铁王座下。这么做颇为聪明，因为包着红布，血迹便不太明显。小公主死时光着脚，身上穿着睡衣，而那男孩……那男孩……。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4121');"><p>Ned could not let that happen again. The realm could not withstand a second mad king, another dance of blood and vengeance. He must find some way to save the children.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4121" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德绝不能让类似的事情重演。王国再不能出现第二个丧心病狂的国王，更经不起又一次充满仇恨的腥风血雨。他得想办法保护那几个孩子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4122');"><p>Robert could be merciful. Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man he had pardoned. Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys the Spider, Lord Balon Greyjoy; each had been counted an enemy to Robert once, and each had been welcomed into friendship and allowed to retain honors and office for a pledge of fealty. So long as a man was brave and honest, Robert would treat him with all the honor and respect due a valiant enemy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4122" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃是很可以表现仁慈的人。巴利斯坦爵士并非他惟一舎免的对象。派席尔国师，“八爪蜘蛛”瓦里斯，巴隆•葛雷乔伊……他们个个曾与劳勃为敌，然而一旦宣誓效忠，也都能得到友谊的拥抱，保留自己的荣誉。只要对方表现英勇，行事正直，劳勃便会将他当成勇敢的对手，尊敬有加。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4123');"><p>This was something else: poison in the dark, a knife thrust to the soul. This he could never forgive, no more than he had forgiven Rhaegar. He will kill them all, Ned realized.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4123" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而这次情况有别：暗中下毒，背后捅刀，这种事他绝对无法原谅，就像他始终无法原谅雷加。我要教他们像龙一样死得干净彻底，奈德想起劳勃的话。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4124');"><p>And yet, he knew he could not keep silent. He had a duty to Robert, to the realm, to the shade of Jon Arryn?.?.?.?and to Bran, who surely must have stumbled on some part of the truth. Why else would they have tried to slay him?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4124" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>即便如此，他依旧无法保持沉默。他要对劳勃负责，更要对整个国家，对死去的琼恩•艾林……对布兰负责。那孩子肯定是无意之中听见部分事实，否则他们何必杀他灭口？ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4125');"><p>Late that afternoon he summoned Tomard, the portly guardsman with the ginger-colored whiskers his children called Fat Tom. With Jory dead and Alyn gone, Fat Tom had command of his household guard. The thought filled Ned with vague disquiet. Tomard was a solid man; affable, loyal, tireless, capable in a limited way, but he was near fifty, and even in his youth he had never been energetic. Perhaps Ned should not have been so quick to send off half his guard, and all his best swords among them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4125" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当天傍晚，他把身材粗壮，留着淡黄胡须，被他的孩子们戏称为“胖汤姆”的守卫托马德找来。由于乔里已死，埃林又出门在外，胖汤姆便成了他的侍卫队长。想到这奈德觉得些微不安，托马德是个很可靠的人，待人和蔼可亲，忠心耿耿，不辞辛劳，某些地方还算能干，但他已年近五十，而即使年轻时也算不上精力充沛。或许奈德不该这么轻易地送走半数侍卫，那些可都是他手下最精良的战士。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4126');"><p>"I shall require your help," Ned said when Tomard appeared, looking faintly apprehensive, as he always did when called before his lord. "Take me to the godswood."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4126" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我需要你帮忙，”托马德进门时，奈德对他说。胖汤姆每当被主人传唤，总有些惴惴不安，这回也不例外。“扶我去神木林。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4127');"><p>"Is that wise, Lord Eddard? With your leg and all?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4127" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“艾德大人，这样好吗？您脚这个样子……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4128');"><p>"Perhaps not. But necessary."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4128" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“或许不好，但我必须这么做。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4129');"><p>Tomard summoned Varly. With one arm around each man’s shoulders, Ned managed to descend the steep tower steps and hobble across the bailey. "I want the guard doubled," he told Fat Tom. "No one enters or leaves the Tower of the Hand without my leave."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4129" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>托马德叫来瓦利，奈德一手扶一人的肩膀，勉强走下高塔陡峭的楼梯，跛着脚穿过内城。“将守卫班次加倍，”他告诉胖汤姆。“未经我允许，任何人不准进出首相塔。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4130');"><p>Tom blinked. "M’lord, with Alyn and the others away, we are hard-pressed already..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4130" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>汤姆眨眨眼。“老爷，眼下少了埃林他们，我们的人手很吃紧——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4131');"><p>"It will only be a short while. Lengthen the watches."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4131" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不用多久。暂时延长值班时间。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4132');"><p>"As you say, m’lord," Tom answered. "Might I ask why..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4132" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“遵命，老爷。”汤姆回答，“我能否询问——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4133');"><p>"Best not," Ned answered crisply.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4133" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“最好不要。”奈德立时回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4134');"><p>The godswood was empty, as it always was here in this citadel of the southron gods. Ned’s leg was screaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart tree. "Thank you." He drew a paper from his sleeve, sealed with the sigil of his House. "Kindly deliver this at once."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4134" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>神木林里空无一人，信仰南方诸神的城堡中，向来如此。等他们在心树旁的草地把他放下，他的脚已经痛得撕心裂肺。“谢谢。”他从袖子里取出一张用家徽印章封好的纸。“麻烦你们立刻把它送去。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4135');"><p>Tomard looked at the name Ned had written on the paper and licked his lips anxiously. "My lord?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4135" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>托马德望见奈德写在纸上的名字，不安地舔舔嘴唇。“老爷……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4136');"><p>"Do as I bid you, Tom," Ned said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4136" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“汤姆，你照办就是。”奈德说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4137');"><p>How long he waited in the quiet of the godswood, he could not say. It was peaceful here. The thick walls shut out the clamor of the castle, and he could hear birds singing, the murmur of crickets, leaves rustling in a gentle wind. The heart tree was an oak, brown and faceless, yet Ned Stark still felt the presence of his gods. His leg did not seem to hurt so much.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4137" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他不知自己在神木林的静谧中等了多久。这里安详而宁静。厚重的围墙阻隔了城堡里的人马喧腾，他听见虫鸣鸟叫，听见叶子在风中瑟瑟作响。此地的心树是一棵棕色橡木，虽然没有刻脸，但奈德依旧可以感觉他所信仰的无名诸神的存在。脚也似乎不那么痛了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4138');"><p>She came to him at sunset, as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers. She came alone, as he had bid her. For once she was dressed simply, in leather boots and hunting greens. When she drew back the hood of her brown cloak, he saw the bruise where the king had struck her. The angry plum color had faded to yellow, and the swelling was down, but there was no mistaking it for anything but what it was.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4138" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>日落时分她才姗姗来临，塔楼高墙上的云朵已经披上红霞。她依约独自前来，难得地衣着朴素，只穿了皮靴和绿色猎衣。当她掀开棕色斗篷的兜帽，他看见国王打她的地方。原本怒放的李子色已经褪为黄色，肿也消去，然而她的遭遇依旧一目了然。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4139');"><p>"Why here?" Cersei Lannister asked as she stood over him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4139" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“为什么在这里？”瑟曦•兰尼斯特站在他面前，高高在上地问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4140');"><p>"So the gods can see."

Her curling blond hair moved in the wind, and her eyes were green as the leaves of summer. It had been a long time since Ned Stark had seen her beauty, but he saw it now. "I know the truth Jon Arryn died for," he told her.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4142');"><p>"Do you?" The queen watched his face, wary as a cat. "Is that why you called me here, Lord Stark? To pose me riddles? Or is it your intent to seize me, as your wife seized my brother?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4142" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是吗？”王后审视着他的脸，如灵猫一般小心翼翼。“史塔克大人，您就为这把我叫来？跟我猜谜语？还是您想学尊夫人挟持我弟弟一样挟持我？”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4144');"><p>"Once or twice." She shied away from his hand. "Never on the face before. Jaime would have killed him, even if it meant his own life." Cersei looked at him defiantly. "My brother is worth a hundred of your friend."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4144" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有一两次，”她别过去。“但没打过脸，否则就算是自身难保，詹姆也会跟他拼命。”瑟曦神情挑衅地看着他，“我弟弟胜过你朋友一百倍。”

The Targaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years, to keep the bloodlines pure. And Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We are one person in two bodies. We shared a womb together. He came into this world holding my foot, our old maester said. When he is in me, I feel?.?.?.?whole." The ghost of a smile flitted over her lips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4146" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“两者都是。”面对真相，她脸上毫无异色。“我们从小就在一起。有何不可？坦格利安家三百年来都是兄妹通婚，以保持血统纯正。詹姆和我不只是姐弟，我们根本是分成两半的同一个生命，我们共享同一子宫。据我们家老师傅说，他托着我的脚方才来到人世。当我俩结合的时候，我才……觉得自己完整。”她的唇上隐约掠过一抹微笑。

Even more so, what would Catelyn do, if it were Jon’s life, against the children of her body? He did not know. He prayed he never would.

Grand Maester Malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion, some ninety years ago, when Tya Lannister wed Gowen Baratheon, third son of the reigning lord. Their only issue, an unnamed boy described in Malleon’s tome as a large and lusty lad born with a full head of black hair, died in infancy. Thirty years before that a male Lannister had taken a Baratheon maid to wife. She had given him three daughters and a son, each black-haired. No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages, always he found the gold yielding before the coal.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4156');"><p>She lifted her head, defiant. "Your Robert got me with child once," she said, her voice thick with contempt. "My brother found a woman to cleanse me. He never knew. If truth be told, I can scarcely bear for him to touch me, and I have not let him inside me for years. I know other ways to pleasure him, when he leaves his whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber. Whatever we do, the king is usually so drunk that he’s forgotten it all by the next morning."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4156" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她倔傲地抬起头。“你那劳勃让我怀过一次孕，”她的口气充满轻蔑。“我弟弟找了个女人帮我把孩子清理掉。他根本不知道这回事。真要我说，我完全无法忍受他碰我一根汗毛。我们已经很多年没有行房了。他要是稍微远离他那些婊子，喝完酒还能跌跌撞撞地找到我房间，我也有其他方法满足他。反正不管我们做些什么，国王通常烂醉如泥，隔天就忘得一千二净。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4157');"><p>How could they have all been so blind? The truth was there in front of them all the time, written on the children’s faces. Ned felt sick.

What did he do to make you hate him so?"

Her fingers brushed lightly against his thigh, the gentlest of promises. "The realm needs a strong Hand. Joff will not come of age for years. No one wants war again, least of all me." Her hand touched his face, his hair. "If friends can turn to enemies, enemies can become friends. Your wife is a thousand leagues away, and my brother has fled. Be kind to me, Ned. I swear to you, you shall never regret it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4162" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“必须怎么做？”她朝他没受伤的脚伸出手，搁在刚过膝盖的地方。“一个真实的人做他想做的事，而不是他必须做的事。”她的手指轻轻拂过他的大腿，带着最温柔的暗示。“离小乔成年还有好些年，国家需要一个强有力的首相。没人想重启战端，我尤其不想。”她的手拂过他的脸庞和头发，“倘若朋友可以反目成仇，我们为何不能化敌为友？尊夫人远在千里之外，我弟弟也不在城中。奈德，对我好一点，我发誓绝不让你后悔。”

</p></origin><translate id="div_4166" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“去你的荣誉，”她啐道，“少给我道貌岸然！你把我当什么了？你自己也有个私生子，我亲眼见过。我很好奇他的母亲是谁？是不是哪个家园被你放火烧掉，随后被你强奸的多恩农家女？还是个婊子？或者是那个哀伤的妹妹，亚夏拉小姐？我听说，当你将拂晓神剑那把‘黎明’送还给她后，她便从城墙投海自尽，这到底是什么缘故啊？是因为被你所杀的哥哥，还是被你偷走的孩子？告诉我啊，最讲究荣誉的艾德大人，你和劳勃，或是我，或是詹姆，究竟有什么差别？”

When the king returns from his hunt, I intend to lay the truth before him. You must be gone by then. You and your children, all three, and not to Casterly Rock.
