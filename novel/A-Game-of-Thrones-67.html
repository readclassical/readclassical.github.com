</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6159');"><p>The oldest were men grown, seventeen and eighteen years from the day of their naming. One was past twenty. Most were younger, sixteen or less.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6159" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们之中最年长的已经成年，达到十七八岁，还有一个年过二十。但多数人都很年轻，在十六岁以下。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6160');"><p>Bran watched them from the balcony of Maester Luwin’s turret, listening to them grunt and strain and curse as they swung their staves and wooden swords. The yard was alive to the clack of wood on wood, punctuated all too often by thwacks and yowls of pain when a blow struck leather or flesh. Ser Rodrik strode among the boys, face reddening beneath his white whiskers, muttering at them one and all. Bran had never seen the old knight look so fierce. "No," he kept saying. "No. No. No."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6160" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰在鲁温师傅塔楼的阳台上观看他们挥舞棍棒和木剑，气喘吁吁，闷哼和咒骂。木头敲击的喀啦声响彻校场，不时还传来挨揍时发出的号叫。罗德利克爵士迈着大步，在男孩群里走来走去，白胡子下脸红成一片，嘴里念念有词，布兰从没见老骑士的表情如此严厉过。“不行，”他不停念叨，“不行，不行，不行啊！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6161');"><p>"They don’t fight very well," Bran said dubiously. He scratched Summer idly behind the ears as the direwolf tore at a haunch of meat. Bones crunched between his teeth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6161" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们打得不太好。”布兰怀疑地说。他漫不经心地搔搔夏天的耳背，冰原狼啃着一块后腿肉，牙齿咬得骨头嘎吱作响。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6162');"><p>"For a certainty," Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky. "Yet given time?.?.?.?Ser Rodrik has the truth of it, we need men to walk the walls. Your lord father took the cream of his guard to King’s Landing, and your brother took the rest, along with all the likely lads for leagues around. Many will not come back to us, and we must needs find the men to take their places."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6162" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没错，”鲁温师傅长叹一声，表示同意。老学士正用长长的密尔透镜管测量影子，计算低挂在晨空中的彗星的位置。“他们得多花时间训练……罗德利克爵士考虑周到，我们需要人手防守城堡。城里精锐的卫士都被你父亲大人带去君临，你哥哥又把剩下的全部带走，方圆几里格内可用的年轻人也都跟着他走了，许多人一去就不会回来。我们得找人代替他们的位置。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6163');"><p>Bran stared resentfully at the sweating boys below. "If I still had my legs, I could beat them all." He remembered the last time he’d held a sword in his hand, when the king had come to Winterfell. It was only a wooden sword, yet he’d knocked Prince Tommen down half a hundred times. "Ser Rodrik should teach me to use a poleaxe. If I had a poleaxe with a big long haft, Hodor could be my legs. We could be a knight together."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6163" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰愤恨地看着楼下汗流浃背的男孩。“如果我还能走路，他们谁都打不过我。”他记得自己最后一次握剑，是国王到临冬城来的时候，只是用把木剑，他却把托曼王子打倒在地好多次。 “罗德利克爵士应该教我用斧子，我去做一把长柄斧，就可以让阿多当我的脚，我们一起当骑士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6164');"><p>"I think that?.?.?.?unlikely," Maester Luwin said. "Bran, when a man fights, his arms and legs and thoughts must be as one."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6164" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想这……恐怕不太可能。”鲁温师傅说，“布兰，打仗的时候，人必须手脚和思想完全一致才行。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6165');"><p>Below in the yard, Ser Rodrik was yelling. "You fight like a goose. He pecks you and you peck him harder. Parry! Block the blow. Goose fighting will not suffice. If those were real swords, the first peck would take your arm off!" One of the other boys laughed, and the old knight rounded on him. "You laugh. You. Now that is gall. You fight like a hedgehog?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6165" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>下方的场子里，罗德利克爵士正在高喊：“你们打起来活像呆头鹅，他啄一下，你啄回去，要挡啊!把攻击挡下来!打架像鹅怎么成?这是真剑的话，啄一下你的手就没啦!”旁边一个男孩忍不住笑出声，老骑士立刻转身面对他。“你觉得好笑?啊? 你到底懂不懂礼貌?你瞧瞧你，打起来像刺猬……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6166');"><p>"There was a knight once who couldn’t see," Bran said stubbornly, as Ser Rodrik went on below. "Old Nan told me about him. He had a long staff with blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and chop two men at once."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6166" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“从前有个骑士眼睛看不见，”布兰固执地说。罗德利克爵士在下面继续喝骂。 “老奶妈跟我说，他有一根长长的棍子，两边都有尖刀，他可以拿在手中转，一次砍两个人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6167');"><p>"Symeon Star-Eyes," Luwin said as he marked numbers in a book. "When he lost his eyes, he put star sapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim. Bran, that is only a story, like the tales of Florian the Fool. A fable from the Age of Heroes." The maester tsked. "You must put these dreams aside, they will only break your heart."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6167" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那是‘星眼’赛米恩，”鲁温边说边在簿子上做记号。“失去双眼之后，他把星辰蓝宝石放进空空的眼窝，吟游诗人是这么唱的。可布兰啊，那只是个故事，就像傻瓜佛罗理安的故事一样，都是从英雄纪元流传下来的寓言。”老学士啧了一声。“你要学着抛开这些白日梦，它们只会伤你心的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6168');"><p>The mention of dreams reminded him. "I dreamed about the crow again last night. The one with three eyes. He flew into my bedchamber and told me to come with him, so I did. We went down to the crypts. Father was there, and we talked. He was sad."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6168" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说到了白日梦，倒是提醒了他。“我昨晚又梦见了那只乌鸦，就是生了三只眼睛的那只。它飞进我的卧房，要我跟它一起走，我就随它去了。我们飞下墓窖，父亲正在那里，我和他说了话。他很难过。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6169');"><p>"And why was that?" Luwin peered through his tube.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6169" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“为什么难过?”鲁温透过镜管向外看。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6170');"><p>"It was something to do about Jon, I think." The dream had been deeply disturbing, more so than any of the other crow dreams. "Hodor won’t go down into the crypts."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6170" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我记得……好像是和琼恩有关的事，”这个梦令他很不舒服，比其他有乌鸦的梦更甚。“后来阿多不肯下墓窖去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6171');"><p>The maester had only been half listening, Bran could tell. He lifted his eye from the tube, blinking. "Hodor won’t?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6171" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰看得出，老师傅有些心不在焉。他把眼睛从镜管上抬起，眨了眨。“阿多不肯怎样?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6172');"><p>"Go down into the crypts. When I woke, I told him to take me down, to see if Father was truly there. At first he didn’t know what I was saying, but I got him to the steps by telling him to go here and go there, only then he wouldn’t go down. He just stood on the top step and said ‘Hodor,’ like he was scared of the dark, but I had a torch. It made me so mad I almost gave him a swat in the head, like Old Nan is always doing." He saw the way the maester was frowning and hurriedly added, "I didn’t, though."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6172" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不肯下墓窖去。我醒来之后，叫他带我下去，看看父亲是不是真的在那里。起初他不明白我在说什么，我只好叫他到这到那，最后走到楼梯边，但他却死活不肯下去。他就站在楼梯口，说着“阿多”，好像他怕黑，可我有火把啊。我好生气，差点就像老奶妈一样敲他的头。”他见老师傅皱起眉头，赶忙补充一句，“不过我没敲啦。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6173');"><p>"Good. Hodor is a man, not a mule to be beaten."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6173" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“很好。阿多是个人，不能像驴子一样随便打的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6174');"><p>"In the dream I flew down with the crow, but I can’t do that when I’m awake," Bran explained.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6174" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在梦里，我跟乌鸦一起飞下去，可我醒来以后就飞不了了。”布兰解释。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6175');"><p>"Why would you want to go down to the crypts?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6175" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你为什么想到墓窖去? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6176');"><p>"I told you. To look for Father."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6176" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我跟你说了啊，去找父亲嘛。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6177');"><p>The maester tugged at the chain around his neck, as he often did when he was uncomfortable. "Bran, sweet child, one day Lord Eddard will sit below in stone, beside his father and his father’s father and all the Starks back to the old Kings in the North?.?.?.?but that will not be for many years, gods be good. Your father is a prisoner of the queen in King’s Landing. You will not find him in the crypts."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6177" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>学士扯扯脖子上的项链，他觉得不安的时候常会这么做。“布兰，好孩子，总有一天艾德大人会化身石像，坐在地底墓窖，和他的父亲、祖父，以及古代冬境之王以来所有的史塔克家人团聚……但愿诸神保佑，那是很多年以后的事。你父亲现下人在君临，是太后的阶下囚，你到了墓窖也找不到他的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6178');"><p>"He was there last night. I talked to him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6178" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可他昨天晚上真的在啊，我还跟他讲话呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6179');"><p>"Stubborn boy," the maester sighed, setting his book aside. "Would you like to go see?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6179" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好个固执的孩子。”老师傅叹口气，把簿子挪到一边。“你想下去看看?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6180');"><p>"I can’t. Hodor won’t go, and the steps are too narrow and twisty for Dancer."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6180" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我去不了，阿多又不肯，楼梯太窄还曲折得厉害，所以小舞也不行。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6181');"><p>"I believe I can solve that difficulty."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6181" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想这还难不倒我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6182');"><p>In place of Hodor, the wildling woman Osha was summoned. She was tall and tough and uncomplaining, willing to go wherever she was commanded. "I lived my life beyond the Wall, a hole in the ground won’t fret me none, m’lords," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6182" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是他找来女野人欧莎代替阿多，她身高体壮，又从不抱怨，叫她去哪里就去哪里。”大人，咱打小在长城外长大，一个地洞吓不倒我，”她保证。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6183');"><p>"Summer, come," Bran called as she lifted him in wiry-strong arms. The direwolf left his bone and followed as Osha carried Bran across the yard and down the spiral steps to the cold vault under the earth. Maester Luwin went ahead with a torch. Bran did not even mind, too badly, that she carried him in her arms and not on her back. Ser Rodrik had ordered Osha’s chain struck off, since she had served faithfully and well since she had been at Winterfell. She still wore the heavy iron shackles around her ankles, a sign that she was not yet wholly trusted, but they did not hinder her sure strides down the steps.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6183" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夏天，过来。“欧莎伸出精瘦而结实双手抱起布兰，布兰一边唤道。冰原狼立刻丢下骨头，跟随欧莎穿过校场，走下螺旋阶梯，来到地底的冰冷墓窖。鲁温师傅走在最前，手持火把。布兰不在意——不太在意——被她抱着，而非背在身后。罗德利克爵士已命人砍断欧莎的脚链，因为她来到临冬城之后，不仅忠心耿耿，而且工作又有效率。两个重镣环虽仍在她踝上——表示她还未得到完全的信赖——却不影响她下楼梯的稳健步伐。•
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6184');"><p>Bran could not recall the last time he had been in the crypts. It had been before, for certain. When he was little, he used to play down here with Robb and Jon and his sisters.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6184" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰不记得自己上次到墓窖来是什么时候的事了，但可以确定，是意外发生之前。他小时候常与罗柏、琼恩及姐姐们在这下面玩耍。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6185');"><p>He wished they were here now; the vault might not have seemed so dark and scary. Summer stalked out in the echoing gloom, then stopped, lifted his head, and sniffed the chill dead air. He bared his teeth and crept backward, eyes glowing golden in the light of the maester’s torch. Even Osha, hard as old iron, seemed uncomfortable. "Grim folk, by the look of them," she said as she eyed the long row of granite Starks on their stone thrones.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6185" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他好希望这会儿他们都在，那样的话，墓窖就不会这么阴森吓人。夏天潜入充满回音的幽暗，停下脚步，抬起头，嗅嗅死寂的冰冷空气。随后它张嘴露出尖牙，缓步向后爬开，在学士的火炬照耀下，它的双眼闪着金光。即便刚强如铁的欧莎，此刻也觉得有些不自在。“看起来都是些阴森的家伙。”她一边扫视长排的大理石王座，一边说，上面坐着历代的史塔克。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6186');"><p>"They were the Kings of Winter," Bran whispered. Somehow it felt wrong to talk too loudly in this place.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6186" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们是冬境之王。”布兰低声道。不知怎地，他觉得在这里似乎不应该大声讲话。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6187');"><p>Osha smiled. "Winter’s got no king. If you’d seen it, you’d know that, summer boy."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6187" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>欧莎微微一笑。“冬天是没有国王的。假如你亲眼见识过凛冬的威力，你就知道啦，夏天的小子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6188');"><p>"They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years," Maester Luwin said, lifting the torch high so the light shone on the stone faces. Some were hairy and bearded, shaggy men fierce as the wolves that crouched by their feet. Others were shaved clean, their features gaunt and sharp-edged as the iron longswords across their laps. "Hard men for a hard time. Come." He strode briskly down the vault, past the procession of stone pillars and the endless carved figures. A tongue of flame trailed back from the upraised torch as he went.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6188" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们在北境称王长达数千年之久，”鲁温师傅说着举起火把，照亮石像的脸庞。它们有的头发极长，生了大胡子，毛茸而坚毅的脸有如趴伏脚下的冰原狼；有的则是修面整洁，五官憔悴而锐利，有如横放膝上的铁剑。“他们都是生长在艰苦环境中的坚毅之人。来吧。”他快步朝墓窖深处走去，经过一排排石柱和无数的雕像，手中高举的火把向后曳出一条长舌。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6189');"><p>The vault was cavernous, longer than Winterfell itself, and Jon had told him once that there were other levels underneath, vaults even deeper and darker where the older kings were buried. It would not do to lose the light. Summer refused to move from the steps, even when Osha followed the torch, Bran in her arms.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6189" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>墓窖宽阔，比临冬城本身还长。琼恩曾对他说，在墓窖底下，更深更幽暗的地方，还有其他墓穴，年代更久远的古代君王便睡在那里。这样看来飞口果火把熄灭，那可就糟了。夏天不肯离开楼梯，只有欧莎怀抱布兰，跟着火把。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6190');"><p>"Do you recall your history, Bran?" the maester said as they walked. "Tell Osha who they were and what they did, if you can."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6190" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“布兰，学过的历史还记得么?”学士边走边说，“如果你还没忘掉，就告诉欧莎这些人是谁，以及他们的生平事迹吧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6191');"><p>He looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to him. The maester had told him the stories, and Old Nan had made them come alive. "That one is Jon Stark. When the sea raiders landed in the east, he drove them out and built the castle at White Harbor. His son was Rickard Stark, not my father’s father but another Rickard, he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter. Theon Stark’s the real thin one with the long hair and the skinny beard. They called him the ‘Hungry Wolf,’ because he was always at war. That’s a Brandon, the tall one with the dreamy face, he was Brandon the Shipwright, because he loved the sea. His tomb is empty. He tried to sail west across the Sunset Sea and was never seen again. His son was Brandon the Burner, because he put the torch to all his father’s ships in grief. There’s Rodrik Stark, who won Bear Island in a wrestling match and gave it to the Mormonts. And that’s Torrhen Stark, the King Who Knelt. He was the last King in the North and the first Lord of Winterfell, after he yielded to Aegon the Conqueror. Oh, there, he’s Cregan Stark. He fought with Prince Aemon once, and the Dragonknight said he’d never faced a finer swordsman." They were almost at the end now, and Bran felt a sadness creeping over him. "And there’s my grandfather, Lord Rickard, who was beheaded by Mad King Aerys. His daughter Lyanna and his son Brandon are in the tombs beside him. Not me, another Brandon, my father’s brother. They’re not supposed to have statues, that’s only for the lords and the kings, but my father loved them so much he had them done."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6191" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是他环顾经过的张张脸庞，属于他们的故事便纷纷涌现。这些故事虽是鲁温师傅告诉他的，但使他们鲜活还得归功于老奶妈。“那个是琼恩•史塔克，海盗从东方来袭时，他把他们打退，并在白港盖了城堡。他的儿子是瑞卡德•史塔克，不是我爷爷，而是另一个瑞卡德，他从沼泽王手中夺走颈泽，并娶了沼泽王的女儿为妻。那个很瘦很瘦，长头发尖胡子的是席恩•史塔克，大家叫他“饿狼”，因为他一天到晚打仗。那个个子很高，一副做梦模样的国王也叫布兰登，‘造船者’布兰登，他很喜欢海洋。他的坟墓是空的，因为他乘船向西横渡落日之海，从此下落不明。他的儿子是‘焚船者’布兰登，他在伤心之余，纵火烧掉了父亲所有的船只。那个是罗德利克•史塔克，传说他在一场摔角比赛里赢得了熊岛，并把熊岛赠送给莫尔蒙家族。那个就是‘降服王’托伦•史塔克，最后的北境之王，第一个临冬城公爵，是他向征服者伊耿投降。噢，你看那边，他是克雷根•史塔克，曾经和伊蒙王子决斗，后来，龙骑士说这辈子再没碰上比他更优秀的剑手。”他们几乎走到了末端，布兰只觉一阵哀伤涌上心头。“那是我爷爷，瑞卡德公爵，他被‘疯王’伊里斯处死。他女儿莱安娜和他儿子布兰登就在他身旁的坟墓里。不是我，是另一个布兰登，我父亲的哥哥。他们原本不该有雕像的，那是公爵和国王才享有的荣耀，可父亲实在太爱他们，所以也为他们造了雕像。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6192');"><p>"The maid’s a fair one," Osha said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6192" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这女孩很漂亮。”欧莎说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6193');"><p>"Robert was betrothed to marry her, but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and raped her," Bran explained. "Robert fought a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar on the Trident with his hammer, but Lyanna died and he never got her back at all."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6193" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃和她已经订了婚，雷加王子却把她强行掳走，并强暴了她。”布兰解释， “为了救她回来，劳勃挑起了一场战争，他在三叉戟河上用自己的战锤亲手杀了雷加，但莱安娜却已经死去，他最后还是来不及救她。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6194');"><p>"A sad tale," said Osha, "but those empty holes are sadder."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6194" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真是个悲伤的故事，”欧莎说，“但那几个空空的洞更教人难过。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6195');"><p>"Lord Eddard’s tomb, for when his time comes," Maester Luwin said. "Is this where you saw your father in your dream, Bran?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6195" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“以后，那里就是艾德大人的坟墓，”鲁温师傅道，“布兰，你梦中就是在这里看到你父亲的吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6196');"><p>"Yes." The memory made him shiver. He looked around the vault uneasily, the hairs on the back of his neck bristling. Had he heard a noise? Was there someone here?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6196" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是啊。”回忆令他颤抖，他不安地环顾墓窖，颈背毛发竖立。他好像听见了什么?难道这里还有别人? 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6197');"><p>Maester Luwin stepped toward the open sepulchre, torch in hand. "As you see, he’s not here. Nor will he be, for many a year. Dreams are only dreams, child." He thrust his arm into the blackness inside the tomb, as into the mouth of some great beast. "Do you see? It’s quite empt..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6197" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温师傅举着火把，朝敞开的坟墓走去。“你看，他不在这儿，他还要等好多好多年才会在这儿。孩子，梦，不过就是梦。”他伸手探进墓穴中的黑暗，活像探进怪兽的巨口。“你看清楚了，这里空得——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6198');"><p>The darkness sprang at him, snarling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6198" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>黑暗咆哮着朝他扑来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6199');"><p>Bran saw eyes like green fire, a flash of teeth, fur as black as the pit around them. Maester Luwin yelled and threw up his hands. The torch went flying from his fingers, caromed off the stone face of Brandon Stark, and tumbled to the statue’s feet, the flames licking up his legs. In the drunken shifting torchlight, they saw Luwin struggling with the direwolf, beating at his muzzle with one hand while the jaws closed on the other.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6199" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一双宛如绿火的眼睛，一排闪烁即逝的洁白利齿，还有黑得像所处墓穴的毛皮。鲁温师傅大叫一声，扬起双手。火把从他指间飞了出去，撞到布兰登•史塔克的石脸，反弹开来，滚落至雕像脚边，火舌舔上他的小腿。在宛如醺醉的摇曳光线下，他们看见鲁温正与一头冰原狼搏斗，他的一只手拼命捶打狼嘴，另一只手则被狼牢牢咬住。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6200');"><p>"Summer!" Bran screamed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6200" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夏天!”布兰尖叫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6201');"><p>And Summer came, shooting from the dimness behind them, a leaping shadow.

No doubt the children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men were by the faces in the trees. As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms, they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire. Horror-struck, the children went to war. The old songs say that the greenseers used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land, shattering the Arm, but it was too late to close the door. The wars went on until the earth ran red with blood of men and children both, but more children than men, for men were bigger and stronger, and wood and stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze.
