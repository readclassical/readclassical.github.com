</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4175');"><p>The heart was steaming in the cool evening air when Khal Drogo set it before her, raw and bloody. His arms were red to the elbow. Behind him, his bloodriders knelt on the sand beside the corpse of the wild stallion, stone knives in their hands. The stallion’s blood looked black in the flickering orange glare of the torches that ringed the high chalk walls of the pit.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4175" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥把血淋淋的心脏置于她面前，这颗心冒出的热气在夜晚的冷气里蒸腾。他两手红至肘部。身后，他的血盟卫手拿石臸短刀，单膝跪在野马尸体旁的沙地上。环绕坑穴的粉白高墙火炬摇曳，橙焰将骏马的血映成漆黑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4176');"><p>Dany touched the soft swell of her belly. Sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her brow. She could feel the old women watching her, the ancient crones of Vaes Dothrak, with eyes that shone dark as polished flint in their wrinkled faces. She must not flinch or look afraid. I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself as she took the stallion’s heart in both hands, lifted it to her mouth, and plunged her teeth into the tough, stringy flesh.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4176" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮轻抚隆起的小腹。汗水在肌肤表面凝结，自她额际流下。她感觉得出维斯•多斯拉克的年迈老妪正看着她，她们爬满皱纹的脸上，眼睛如磨亮的燧石闪着黑光。她不能退缩，不能畏惧。“我是真龙传人，”她一边双手捧起马心，一边这么告诉自己。随后她把马心举到嘴边，用尽力气，朝坚韧的生肉咬去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4177');"><p>Warm blood filled her mouth and ran down over her chin. The taste threatened to gag her, but she made herself chew and swallow. The heart of a stallion would make her son strong and swift and fearless, or so the Dothraki believed, but only if the mother could eat it all. If she choked on the blood or retched up the flesh, the omens were less favorable; the child might be stillborn, or come forth weak, deformed, or female.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4177" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>温热的鲜血溢满口中，自她下巴流下。味道几乎令她作呕，但她强忍着继续咀嚼，继续吞咽。多斯拉克人相信，马心能使儿子体魄强健、身手敏捷、无所畏惧，但作母亲的必须吃下整颗心。假如她被血呛到，或者把肉吐出，便是不祥预兆：胎儿可能流产，或先天多病，畸形，甚至是生女儿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4178');"><p>Her handmaids had helped her ready herself for the ceremony. Despite the tender mother’s stomach that had afflicted her these past two moons, Dany had dined on bowls of half-clotted blood to accustom herself to the taste, and Irri made her chew strips of dried horseflesh until her jaws were aching. She had starved herself for a day and a night before the ceremony in the hopes that hunger would help her keep down the raw meat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4178" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>为了这次仪式，她的女仆们已帮她做过精心准备。过去这两个月，丹妮虽因害喜身体不适，却还是以一碗碗半凝固的血块为食，让自己习惯血腥味。伊丽把一片片的马肉拿给她嚼，直到她双颊发痛。仪式举行之前，她还特别一整天不进食，希望饥饿能帮助她吞咽生肉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4179');"><p>The wild stallion’s heart was all muscle, and Dany had to worry it with her teeth and chew each mouthful a long time. No steel was permitted within the sacred confines of Vaes Dothrak, beneath the shadow of the Mother of Mountains; she had to rip the heart apart with teeth and nails. Her stomach roiled and heaved, yet she kept on, her face smeared with the heartsblood that sometimes seemed to explode against her lips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4179" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>野生骏马的心全是结实的肌肉，丹妮得用牙齿竭力撕咬，细嚼慢咽才能吞下。圣母山笼罩下的圣城维斯•多斯拉克严禁刀械，所以她只能用牙齿和指甲撕开马心。她的胃里阵阵翻腾，但她咬牙坚持，还必须忍受不时喷溅到脸上的马血。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4180');"><p>Khal Drogo stood over her as she ate, his face as hard as a bronze shield. His long black braid was shiny with oil. He wore gold rings in his mustache, gold bells in his braid, and a heavy belt of solid gold medallions around his waist, but his chest was bare. She looked at him whenever she felt her strength failing; looked at him, and chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed. Toward the end, Dany thought she glimpsed a fierce pride in his dark, almond-shaped eyes, but she could not be sure. The khal’s face did not often betray the thoughts within.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4180" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥高高地站在一旁，看着她吃，那张脸严峻得像青铜盾牌。他长长的黑发辪闪着油亮光泽，小胡子里挂了金环，发辪扎着铃铛，一条沉甸甸的金章腰带系在腰间，胸膛却是赤裸。每当她觉得力量渐失，便抬头望他，然后继续咬牙切齿、咀嚼吞咽。末了，她仿佛在他杏仁状的黑眼瞳里，瞥见了某种坚毅的骄傲，但她不敢确定。无论卡奥心绪为何，他都很少显现于色。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4181');"><p>And finally it was done. Her cheeks and fingers were sticky as she forced down the last of it. Only then did she turn her eyes back to the old women, the crones of the dosh khaleen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4181" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>终于结束了。她吞下最后一块马肉，双颊和手指早巳僵麻。这时她才敢将视线转回到那群老妇人，亦即多希卡林的老妪们身上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4182');"><p>"Khalakka dothrae mr’anha!" she proclaimed in her best Dothraki. A prince rides inside me! She had practiced the phrase for days with her handmaid Jhiqui.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4182" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“卡拉喀，多斯雷，姆安哈！”她用自己最辬准的多斯拉克语说，意思是：王子在我体内骑马！多日以来，她和女仆姬琪反复练习这句话。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4183');"><p>The oldest of the crones, a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single black eye, raised her arms on high. "Khalakka dothrae!" she shrieked. The prince is riding!
</p></origin><translate id="div_4183" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老妪中最年迈的一位，一个弯腰驼背，骨瘦如柴，只剩一只黑眼的老女人双手高举。“卡拉喀，多斯雷！”，她厉声叫道，意思是：王子骑着马！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4184');"><p>"He is riding!" the other women answered. "Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!" they proclaimed. A boy, a boy, a strong boy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4184" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他骑着马！”，另一个女人应道，“拉克！拉克！拉克哈！”她们齐声宣布：是个男孩，是个男孩，是个强壮的男孩。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4185');"><p>Bells rang, a sudden clangor of bronze birds. A deep-throated warhorn sounded its long low note. The old women began to chant. Underneath their painted leather vests, their withered dugs swayed back and forth, shiny with oil and sweat. The eunuchs who served them threw bundles of dried grasses into a great bronze brazier, and clouds of fragrant smoke rose up toward the moon and the stars. The Dothraki believed the stars were horses made of fire, a great herd that galloped across the sky by night.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4185" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>铃声作响，宛如一阵突如其来的青铜鸟鸣。军号奏出低沉的长音，老妇们开吟唱。在彩绘皮背心下，她们干瘪的乳房来回晃动，闪着油亮汗光。负责伺候她们的太监把一捆捆干草丢进青铜大火盆，顷刻间散发出浓郁的草香，烟雾向天上的月亮星辰直冲而去。在多斯拉克人眼里，星星就是一群以烈火为躯，声势浩大，奔跑夜空的骏马。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4186');"><p>As the smoke ascended, the chanting died away and the ancient crone closed her single eye, the better to peer into the future. The silence that fell was complete. Dany could hear the distant call of night birds, the hiss and crackle of the torches, the gentle lapping of water from the lake. The Dothraki stared at her with eyes of night, waiting.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4186" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当浓烟渐升，吟唱声逐渐变小，年迈的老妪阖上她的独眼，朝未来瞥去。继之而来的是全然的寂静，丹妮听见远处的鸟儿啼叫，火炬嘶嘶噼啪，湖水轻柔拍打。多拉克人以漆黑如夜的眼睛看着她，等待预言。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4187');"><p>Khal Drogo laid his hand on Dany’s arm. She could feel the tension in his fingers. Even a khal as mighty as Drogo could know fear when the dosh khaleen peered into smoke of the future. At her back, her handmaids fluttered anxiously.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4187" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥伸手握住丹妮臂膀，从手指的力道她感觉得出他的紧张。强如卓戈卡奥，在多希卡林透过烟尘占卜未来时也会感到恐惧。身后，她的女仆更是焦躁不安。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4188');"><p>Finally the crone opened her eye and lifted her arms. "I have seen his face, and heard the thunder of his hooves," she proclaimed in a thin, wavery voice.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4188" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>最后老妪睁开独眼，举起双臂。“我看见了他的脸，听见他蹄声如雷。”她用尖而颤抖的声音宣布。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4189');"><p>"The thunder of his hooves!" the others chorused.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4189" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他蹄声如雷！”几个老妪同声应道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4190');"><p>"As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name." The old woman trembled and looked at Dany almost as if she were afraid. "The prince is riding, and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4190" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他的马迅疾如风，身后的卡拉萨覆盖整片大地，不可胜数，手中的亚拉克弯刀锋利如同芒草。王子将会如暴风般威猛，他的敌人会在他面前颤抖不休，敌人的妻子将悲伤泣血，哀恸欲绝。他发际的铃铛歌颂他的到来，居住在石头营帐的‘奶人’惧怕他的名号。”老妇颤抖着望向丹妮，仿佛十分惧怕。“王子骑着马，他将成为骑着世界的骏马！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4191');"><p>"The stallion who mounts the world!" the onlookers cried in echo, until the night rang to the sound of their voices.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4191" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“骑着世界的骏马！”，人们应声高呼，直到夜晚充溢他们的呼唤。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4192');"><p>The one-eyed crone peered at Dany. "What shall he be called, the stallion who mounts the world?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4192" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>独眼老妪睨向丹妮。“骑着世界的骏马要叫什么名字？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4193');"><p>She stood to answer. "He shall be called Rhaego," she said, using the words that Jhiqui had taught her. Her hands touched the swell beneath her breasts protectively as a roar went up from the Dothraki. "Rhaego," they screamed. "Rhaego, Rhaego, Rhaego!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4193" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她起身回答。“我们将叫他雷戈。”她说出姬琪事先教她的字。多斯拉克人群顿时响起震耳欲聋的呐喊，她下意识地伸手护住胸部下方隆起的肚腹。“雷戈，”他们尖叫，“雷戈，雷戈，雷戈！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4194');"><p>The name was still ringing in her ears as Khal Drogo led her from the pit. His bloodriders fell in behind them. A procession followed them out onto the godsway, the broad grassy road that ran through the heart of Vaes Dothrak, from the horse gate to the Mother of Mountains. The crones of the dosh khaleen came first, with their eunuchs and slaves. Some supported themselves with tall carved staffs as they struggled along on ancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any horselord. Each of the old women had been a khaleesi once. When their lord husbands died and a new khal took his place at the front of his riders, with a new khaleesi mounted beside him, they were sent here, to reign over the vast Dothraki nation. Even the mightiest of khals bowed to the wisdom and authority of the dosh khaleen. Still, it gave Dany the shivers to think that one day she might be sent to join them, whether she willed it or no.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4194" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥领她离开坑穴时，这名字还在她耳际回荡。他的血盟卫尾随在后。庞大的队伍走上众神大道。那是一条宽广嫩绿，贯穿维斯•多斯拉克心脏，从马门直到圣母山下的道路。队伍前列是多希卡林的老妪，以及侍候她们的太监与奴隶。她们有的拄着长长的雕花拐杖，挣扎摆动着老迈而颤抖的双脚；有的则犹如马王般昂首阔步。这些老妇人一度都是卡丽熙，当她们的丈夫过世，新的卡奥走上骑马战士的前列，而新的卡丽熙与他并肩共骑，她们便被送来这里，负责统理广大的多斯拉克国度。即便势力最大的卡奥，也得服膺多希卡林的臹慧和威权。虽然如此，想到有朝一日不论自己情愿与否，都会被送来这里，成为她们一员，丹妮还是不禁打了个冷颤。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4195');"><p>Behind the wise women came the others; Khal Ogo and his son, the khalakka Fogo, Khal Jommo and his wives, the chief men of Drogo’s khalasar, Dany’s handmaids, the khal’s servants and slaves, and more. Bells rang and drums beat a stately cadence as they marched along the godsway. Stolen heroes and the gods of dead peoples brooded in the darkness beyond the road. Alongside the procession, slaves ran lightly through the grass with torches in their hands, and the flickering flames made the great monuments seem almost alive.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4195" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其他人跟随在女臹者之后：奥戈卡奥和他的儿子佛戈卡拉喀，鸠摩卡奥和他的妻妾，卓戈卡拉萨的首脑成员，丹妮的侍女，卡奥的贴身奴仆，以及其他人。节奏庄严的铃铛鼓乐伴随他们走在众神大道上。从早已灭绝的种族手中盗来的英雄和神灵雕像默立于路旁的黑暗之中。奴隶轻快地跑在队伍两旁的草地上，手里擎着火把。摇曳的火焰照映下，雄伟的雕像好像有了生命。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4196');"><p>"What is meaning, name Rhaego?" Khal Drogo asked as they walked, using the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She had been teaching him a few words when she could. Drogo was quick to learn when he put his mind to it, though his accent was so thick and barbarous that neither Ser Jorah nor Viserys could understand a word he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4196" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“什么意思，名字雷戈？”卓戈卡奥边走边用七国的普通话问。平时他若有空，她便教他几个单字。卓戈一旦专心，学习速度很快，然而他的口音委实太重，十足野蛮人腔调，以致不论乔拉爵士还是韦赛里斯都听不懂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4197');"><p>"My brother Rhaegar was a fierce warrior, my sun-and-stars," she told him. "He died before I was born. Ser Jorah says that he was the last of the dragons."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4197" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的日和星，我哥哥雷加生前是个勇猛的战士，”她告诉他，“我还没出生他就战死了。乔拉爵士说他是真龙的最后传人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4198');"><p>Khal Drogo looked down at her. His face was a copper mask, yet under the long black mustache, drooping beneath the weight of its gold rings, she thought she glimpsed the shadow of a smile. "Is good name, Dan Ares wife, moon of my life," he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4198" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥低头看她，脸庞如同赤铜面具，但在那被金环拉得低垂的长长黑胡须下，她却隐约瞥见了一抹微笑。“是好名字，丹瑞……里丝妻子，我生命的月亮。”他说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4199');"><p>They rode to the lake the Dothraki called the Womb of the World, surrounded by a fringe of reeds, its water still and calm. A thousand thousand years ago, Jhiqui told her, the first man had emerged from its depths, riding upon the back of the first horse.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4199" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们骑马经过一座长满芦苇的静湖，湖面平坦如镜，多斯拉克人称其为“世界的子宫”。姬琪告诉她：几千万年以前，世界上第一个人便是从湖深处骑着世界上第一匹马出现的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4200');"><p>The procession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled clothing fall to the ground. Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she pushed through the tall reeds. The moon floated on the still black waters, shattering and re-forming as her ripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness crept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion’s blood had dried on her hands and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over her head, cleansing herself and the child inside her while the khal and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the dosh khaleen muttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what they were saying.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4200" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>队伍静候于绿草波荡的岸边，丹妮则脱去身上的脏衣服放在地上，赤身裸体，小心翼翼地探脚入水。伊丽说这湖深不见底，可丹妮一边拨开高大的芦苇，一边却感觉到脚趾间挤压的软泥。月亮漂浮在平静的黑水面，随着她激起的涟漪不断碎裂，又复聚合。寒意爬上她的大腿，亲吻她的下体，她白晰的肌肤上立时起了鸡皮疙瘩。手上和嘴边的马血早已干涸，她伸手捧起圣水，高举自头淋下，在卡奥和众目睽睽之下，涤净自己和体内的胎儿。她听见多希卡林的老妇低声私语，不禁好奇她们在说些什么。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4201');"><p>When she emerged from the lake, shivering and dripping, her handmaid Doreah hurried to her with a robe of painted sandsilk, but Khal Drogo waved her away. He was looking on her swollen breasts and the curve of her belly with approval, and Dany could see the shape of his manhood pressing through his horsehide trousers, below the heavy gold medallions of his belt. She went to him and helped him unlace. Then her huge khal took her by the hips and lifted her into the air, as he might lift a child. The bells in his hair rang softly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4201" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>待她浑身发抖，滴水淋漓自湖中归返，女仆多莉亚急忙拿起彩绘纱丝袍给她，却被卓戈卡奥挥手赶开。他面带称许地望着她肿胀的胸乳和腹部的浑圆曲线。丹妮看见那条厚重的金章腰带下，他的命根在马皮缝臸的裤子里紧紧撑立。她上前为他解开裤带，魁梧的卡奥托住她的臀部，像抱小孩似地将她举到半空，发际的铃铛轻轻作响。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4202');"><p>Dany wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed her face against his neck as he thrust himself inside her. Three quick strokes and it was done. "The stallion who mounts the world," Drogo whispered hoarsely. His hands still smelled of horse blood. He bit at her throat, hard, in the moment of his pleasure, and when he lifted her off, his seed filled her and trickled down the inside of her thighs. Only then was Doreah permitted to drape her in the scented sandsilk, and Irri to fit soft slippers to her feet.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4202" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮伸手搂住他肩膀，将脸贴紧他的颈项。他插进她的体内，有了三下，一切便化为朦胧。 “骑着世界的骏马。”卓戈沙哑地低语。他的手上仍有马血的味道。高潮来临的瞬间，他用力咬了她喉咙一口。等他把她抱开，他的体液充满她的体内，自大腿内侧缓缓流下。这时多莉亚才得以用洒过香水的纱丝袍裹住她，伊丽则为她穿上柔软的拖鞋。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4203');"><p>Khal Drogo laced himself up and spoke a command, and horses were brought to the lakeshore. Cohollo had the honor of helping the khaleesi onto her silver. Drogo spurred his stallion, and set off down the godsway beneath the moon and stars. On her silver, Dany easily kept pace.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4203" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥系好裤带，一声令下，立即有人将马牵来湖边。科霍罗扶卡丽熙骑上银马，卓戈一踢马刺，在月亮和星辰照耀下朝众神大道急驰而去。丹妮驱策银马，从容不迫地跟上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4204');"><p>The silk tenting that roofed Khal Drogo’s hall had been rolled up tonight, and the moon followed them inside. Flames leapt ten feet in the air from three huge stone-lined firepits. The air was thick with the smells of roasting meat and curdled, fermented mare’s milk. The hall was crowded and noisy when they entered, the cushions packed with those whose rank and name were not sufficient to allow them at the ceremony. As Dany rode beneath the arched entry and up the center aisle, every eye was on her. The Dothraki screamed out comments on her belly and her breasts, hailing the life within her. She could not understand all they shouted, but one phrase came clear. "The stallion that mounts the world," she heard, bellowed in a thousand voices.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4204" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥宫殿顶端的丝织帷幕，今晚已被卷起，月光追随着他们进入室内。三个石砌火盆里，烈焰高高腾跃，离地十尺。空气中充满烤肉和发酵的凝固马奶味道。他们进门时大厅中已是人声鼎沸，摩肩擦踵。靠垫上坐满了地位较低，没有资格参加仪式的人。丹妮骑马穿过拱门，走上中间凸起的走道，众人的目光都集中在她身上。多斯拉克人对她的肚子和胸乳大发议论，为她体内的小生命喝采。她无法完全听懂他们说的内容，但有一句清晰无比：“骑着世界的骏马”，几千个人异口同声地呼喝。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4205');"><p>The sounds of drums and horns swirled up into the night. Half-clothed women spun and danced on the low tables, amid joints of meat and platters piled high with plums and dates and pomegranates. Many of the men were drunk on clotted mare’s milk, yet Dany knew no arakhs would clash tonight, not here in the sacred city, where blades and bloodshed were forbidden.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4205" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鼓声和号角响彻夜空，低矮的桌上摆满菜肴，盘中的李子、蜜枣和石榴堆得老高，还有大块大块的肉，衣着暴露的女人灵动舞跃、穿梭其间。许多人早已被马奶酒灌得烂醉如泥，然而丹妮知道今晚决不会有流血冲突，因为在圣城里，不论刀械或打斗都被绝对禁止。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4206');"><p>Khal Drogo dismounted and took his place on the high bench. Khal Jommo and Khal Ogo, who had been in Vaes Dothrak with their khalasars when they arrived, were given seats of high honor to Drogo’s right and left. The bloodriders of the three khals sat below them, and farther down Khal Jommo’s four wives.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4206" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥下马，坐上高处的凳子。他们抵达维斯•多斯拉克期间，鸠摩卡奥和奥戈卡奥与其卡拉萨也在城内，因此两人被安排在卓戈左右两侧的荣誉位置。三位卡奥的血盟卫坐在他们下方，再下面坐了鸠摩卡奥的四个太太。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4207');"><p>Dany climbed off her silver and gave the reins to one of the slaves. As Doreah and Irri arranged her cushions, she searched for her brother. Even across the length of the crowded hall, Viserys should have been conspicuous with his pale skin, silvery hair, and beggar’s rags, but she did not see him anywhere.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4207" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮莉丝爬下银马，将缰绳交给一名奴隶。趁着多莉亚和伊丽为她摆放靠垫的空当，她在人群中搜寻哥哥的踪影。即便在人潮拥挤的大厅，白肤、银发，一身破烂的韦赛里斯也很好辨认，可今天她却辫寻不着。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4208');"><p>Her glance roamed the crowded tables near the walls, where men whose braids were even shorter than their manhoods sat on frayed rugs and flat cushions around the low tables, but all the faces she saw had black eyes and copper skin. She spied Ser Jorah Mormont near the center of the hall, close to the middle firepit. It was a place of respect, if not high honor; the Dothraki esteemed the knight’s prowess with a sword. Dany sent Jhiqui to bring him to her table. Mormont came at once, and went to one knee before her. "Khaleesi," he said, "I am yours to command."
