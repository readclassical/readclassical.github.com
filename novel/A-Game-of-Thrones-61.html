</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5507');"><p>Are you well, Snow?" Lord Mormont asked, scowling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5507" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“雪诺，你还好吧?”莫尔蒙司令皱眉问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5508');"><p>"Well," his raven squawked. "Well."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5508" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好吧?”他的乌鸦呱呱叫，“好吧? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5509');"><p>"I am, my lord," Jon lied?.?.?.?loudly, as if that could make it true. "And you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5509" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，我很好。”琼恩撒了谎……还特意大声，仿佛这样可让谎言成真。“您呢?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5510');"><p>Mormont frowned. "A dead man tried to kill me. How well could I be?" He scratched under his chin. His shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire, and he’d hacked it off. The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old, disreputable, and grumpy. "You do not look well. How is your hand?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5510" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙又是眉头一皱。“有个死人想杀我，你觉得我能好到哪里去?”他抓了抓下巴。由于长长的灰胡子被火烧到，他便把胡子给割了。新长出来的白色短须使他看起来不仅丑陋了些，老上许多，更显得脾气暴躁。“说实话，你的气色不太好，手怎么样了?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5511');"><p>"Healing." Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him. He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow. At the time he’d felt nothing; the agony had come after. His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers, big as roaches. "The maester says I’ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5511" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“正在复原。”琼恩动动自己绑了绷带的手指给他看。扔那堆窗帘所带来的灼伤比他预期中严重许多，现在他的右手臂缠满了丝绷带，一直绑到手肘。当时他一点感觉也没有，之后才开始疼痛。他裂开的红皮肤内流出液体，一个个吓人的充血水泡布满指间，大得像蟑螂似的。“学士说会留下疤痕，但除此之外应该没有大碍。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5512');"><p>"A scarred hand is nothing. On the Wall, you’ll be wearing gloves often as not."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5512" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“手上有疤没关系，在长城这儿，你大多时候都会戴手套。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5513');"><p>"As you say, my lord." It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon; it was the rest of it. Maester Aemon had given him milk of the poppy, yet even so, the pain had been hideous. At first it had felt as if his hand were still aflame, burning day and night. Only plunging it into basins of snow and shaved ice gave any relief at all. Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw him writhing on his bed, whimpering from the pain. And when at last he did sleep, he dreamt, and that was even worse. In the dream, the corpse he fought had blue eyes, black hands, and his father’s face, but he dared not tell Mormont that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5513" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，您说的是。”困扰琼恩的不是疤痕，而是其他的部分。伊蒙师傅给他喝了罂粟花奶，但即便如此，手依旧痛得要命。起初他感觉自己的手仍然着火，日夜烧个不停，惟有将之插进装满陈雪和碎冰的盆子里才能稍减疼痛。琼恩在床上疼痛难耐，翻滚哀嚎的模样，只有白灵知道，为此他暗自感谢天上诸神。可等他真的睡了，他又会作梦，这些梦比手伤还可怕。在梦中，和他厮杀的尸体不仅有蓝眼睛和黑手掌，更有父亲的脸，他可不敢把这个告诉莫尔蒙。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5514');"><p>"Dywen and Hake returned last night," the Old Bear said. "They found no sign of your uncle, no more than the others did."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5514" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“戴文和哈克昨晚回来了，”熊老说，“和其他人一样，他们没找到半点你叔叔的踪迹。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5515');"><p>"I know." Jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends, and the failure of the rangers’ search had been all the men had been talking of.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5515" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道。”昨晚琼恩硬拖着身子去大厅和朋友们共进晚餐，当时大家谈论的都是游骑兵失败的搜查行动。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5516');"><p>"You know," Mormont grumbled. "How is it that everyone knows everything around here?" He did not seem to expect an answer. "It would seem there were only the two of?.?.?.?of those creatures, whatever they were, I will not call them men. And thank the gods for that. Any more and?.?.?.?well, that doesn’t bear thinking of. There will be more, though. I can feel it in these old bones of mine, and Maester Aemon agrees. The cold winds are rising. Summer is at an end, and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5516" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你也知道，”莫尔蒙咕哝，“怎么大家什么都知道啊? ”他也没期待答案。“看来，总共就那么两个……东西。不管他们是什么，我绝对不承认他们是人。感谢天上诸神。要是再多几个……唉，还是别去想的好。只是我这身老骨头有预感，以后迟早会再碰上，伊蒙师傅也这么说。冷风吹起，夏日将尽，前所未见的寒冬即将来临。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5517');"><p>Winter is coming. The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as they did now. "My lord," he asked hesitantly, "it’s said there was a bird last night?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5517" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凛冬将至。对琼恩而言，史塔克家的箴言从未如此阴森，如此充满不祥之气。“大人，”他迟疑地说，“听说昨晚又来了一只鸟儿……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5518');"><p>"There was. What of it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5518" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是有这么回事。怎样? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5519');"><p>"I had hoped for some word of my father."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5519" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想知道有没有我父亲的消息。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5520');"><p>"Father," taunted the old raven, bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont’s shoulders. "Father."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5520" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“父亲!”老乌鸦在莫尔蒙肩上走来走去，头上下摆动，嘲弄地叫道，“父亲!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5521');"><p>The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut, but the raven hopped up on his head, fluttered its wings, and flew across the chamber to light above a window. "Grief and noise," Mormont grumbled. "That’s all they’re good for, ravens. Why I put up with that pestilential bird?.?.?.?if there was news of Lord Eddard, don’t you think I would have sent for you? Bastard or no, you’re still his blood. The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy. It seems he’s been removed from the Kingsguard. They gave his place to that black dog Clegane, and now Selmy’s wanted for treason. The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but he slew two of them and escaped." Mormont snorted, leaving no doubt of his view of men who’d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold. "We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne," he said in disgust.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5521" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>司令伸手想捏住它的长嘴，但乌鸦跳上他的头，拍拍翅膀，飞过房间，停在窗户上。“就只会吵闹捣蛋，”莫尔蒙咕哝着说，“乌鸦通通这副德行，真不知我养这只讨人厌的鸟做什么……如果有艾德大人的消息，你觉得我会不叫你来么?无论你是不是私生子，你毕竟是他的亲生骨肉。信上说的是巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士的事。他似乎被从御林铁卫里给革职了。他们把他原先的席位给了那条黑狗克里冈，现在赛尔弥正被通缉中，罪名是叛国。那些蠢才派了几个卫士去拿他，结果他宰了两个后逃走了。”莫尔蒙哼了一声，他对那些派都城守卫去对付像无畏的巴利斯坦如此武艺超凡的人的看法，溢于言表。“我们这儿森林里有白色鬼影，城里面有不安分的死人行走，结果坐在铁王座上的竟是个小毛头!”他语带嫌恶地说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5522');"><p>The raven laughed shrilly. "Boy, boy, boy, boy."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5522" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乌鸦尖声怪笑: “小毛头! 小毛头! 小毛头!小毛头!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5523');"><p>Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear’s best hope, Jon remembered; if he had fallen, what chance was there that Mormont’s letter would be heeded? He curled his hand into a fist. Pain shot through his burned fingers. "What of my sisters?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5523" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩记得熊老对巴利斯坦爵士寄予厚望，如果连他都失势，那莫尔蒙的信还有什么机会上达国王呢? 他不禁紧握手指，剧痛却立即从伤口炸裂开来。“那我妹妹呢?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5524');"><p>"The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls." He gave an irritated shrug. "Perhaps they never got my letter. Aemon sent two copies, with his best birds, but who can say? More like, Pycelle did not deign to reply. It would not be the first time, nor the last. I fear we count for less than nothing in King’s Landing. They tell us what they want us to know, and that’s little enough."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5524" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“信上既没提到艾德大人，也没说他女儿的事。”他有些恼火地耸耸肩。“说不定他们根本就没收到我的信。虽然伊蒙师傅送了两份抄本，也派他最好的鸟儿带去了，可这种事谁说得准呢?我看八成是派席尔懒得回信。这也不是第一次了，当然更不会是最后一次。恐怕对君临那些人而言，我们什么也不是。他们只肯告诉我们他们想让我们知道的事，而这些事少得可怜!”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5525');"><p>And you tell me what you want me to know, and that’s less, Jon thought resentfully. His brother Robb had called the banners and ridden south to war, yet no word of that had been breathed to him?.?.?.?save by Samwell Tarly, who’d read the letter to Maester Aemon and whispered its contents to Jon that night in secret, all the time saying how he shouldn’t. Doubtless they thought his brother’s war was none of his concern. It troubled him more than he could say. Robb was marching and he was not. No matter how often Jon told himself that his place was here now, with his new brothers on the Wall, he still felt craven.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5525" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>你也只告诉我你想让我知道的事，这些事还更少呢，琼恩忿忿不平地想。罗柏已经号召封臣，率军南进，却没有人告诉他……后来还是念信给伊蒙学士听的山姆威尔•塔利当天夜里偷偷跑来找他，一边轻声细语，一边忏悔自己不该这么做。可想而知，他们一定是认为他兄弟的战争与他无关。然而这却比其他所有事更教他烦心。罗柏正驰骋沙场，他却坐困愁城。无论琼恩如何宽慰自己：如今他的职责所在是与新弟兄们共同防守长城，他依旧觉得自己像个懦夫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5526');"><p>"Corn," the raven was crying. "Corn, corn."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5526" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“玉米!”乌鸦又叫起来，“玉米!玉米!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5527');"><p>"Oh, be quiet," the Old Bear told it. "Snow, how soon does Maester Aemon say you’ll have use of that hand back?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5527" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“噢，给我闭嘴。”熊老告诉它。“雪诺，伊蒙师傅估计你的手多久可以复原?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5528');"><p>"Soon," Jon replied.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5528" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“快了。”琼恩回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5529');"><p>"Good." On the table between them, Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver. "Here. You’ll be ready for this, then."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5529" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那敢情好，”莫尔蒙司令拿出一把剑，放在两人之间的桌上，那剑有着黑色金属镶银边的鞘。“喏，到时候你就用这个。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5530');"><p>The raven flapped down and landed on the table, strutting toward the sword, head cocked curiously. Jon hesitated. He had no inkling what this meant. "My lord?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5530" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乌鸦振翅而下，停在桌上，昂首阔步地朝剑走去，一边好奇地歪着头。琼恩犹豫了一下。这究竟是什么意思，他一点头绪都没有。“大人，这是? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5531');"><p>"The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip. Well, dry leather and old wood, what could you expect? The blade, now?.?.?.?you’d need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade." Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks. "I had the rest made anew. Take it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5531" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“之前那场火把剑柄圆头的银给熔掉了，护手和剑柄也被烧毁，唉，干皮革和木头，不烧才有鬼。至于剑本身嘛……你得用热一百倍的火才能伤到剑身。”莫尔蒙把手一挥，连剑带鞘推过粗糙的橡木桌面。“我把其余的部分重新打过了。拿去吧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5532');"><p>"Take it," echoed his raven, preening. "Take it, take it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5532" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“拿去吧!”乌鸦得意洋洋地附和，“拿去吧!拿去吧!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5533');"><p>Awkwardly, Jon took the sword in hand. His left hand; his bandaged right was still too raw and clumsy. Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5533" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩僵硬地伸手拿剑。他用的是左手，因为右手不但绑了绷带，而且伤口未愈，不甚灵活。他小心翼翼地将剑从鞘里抽出，举到眼前。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5534');"><p>The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade. It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf’s head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes. The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood. The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal. Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a "bastard sword." Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before. When Jon turned it sideways, he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again. "This is Valyrian steel, my lord," he said wonderingly. His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look, the feel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5534" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>剑柄尾端的圆球是一块淡白色的石头，还加了铅以平衡剑身的重量，圆球雕刻成一只咆哮狼头的模样，眼睛是两小片红榴石。剑柄裹着又黑又软的新皮，未经汗渍和血水沾染。剑身则足足比琼恩惯用的剑长了半尺，前端极尖，既能刺击，亦可挥砍，上面开了三道深深的血槽。“寒冰”是名副其实的双手剑，这把则是一手半，有时也称为“长柄剑”。这柄狼剑似乎比他以前用过的剑都轻。琼恩轻转剑身，看到色泽沉暗的精钢剑身历经千锤百炼所留下的波纹。“大人，这是用瓦雷利亚钢锻铸的剑啊。”他讶异地说。父亲以前时常让他把握“寒冰”，所以他知道这外观和手感。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5535');"><p>"It is," the Old Bear told him. "It was my father’s sword, and his father’s before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5535" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没错。”熊老告诉他，“这是我父亲的剑，是我祖父传给他的。这把剑在莫尔蒙家族父子相传了五百年，我年轻时也用这把剑，后来我穿上黑衣，便将它传给儿子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5536');"><p>He is giving me his son’s sword. Jon could scarcely believe it. The blade was exquisitely balanced. The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light. "Your son..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5536" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他将传给儿子的剑给了我，琼恩简直不敢相信。剑刃极度平衡，锋芒一遇光线，立即熠熠发光。“您的儿子——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5537');"><p>"My son brought dishonor to House Mormont, but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind when he fled. My sister returned it to my keeping, but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah’s shame, so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber. The original pommel was a bear’s head, silver, yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable. For you, I thought a white wolf more apt. One of our builders is a fair stonecarver."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5537" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我儿让莫尔蒙家族蒙上耻辱，但他逃亡之前，倒还懂得留下这把剑。我妹妹把剑送还给我，然而每当见到它，就让我想起乔拉的事，所以我把剑收起来，日子一久也就忘了，直到这回在我卧室的灰烬里找到它。原本剑柄尾端是个银臸熊头，不过因为经年累月的磨损，早已辨认不出。你用的话，我想白狼比较适合。正好我们工匠里面有个不错的雕刻师傅。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5538');"><p>When Jon had been Bran’s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father’s life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand. Even then he had known it was only a child’s folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father’s sword. Even the memory shamed him. What kind of man stole his own brother’s birthright? I have no right to this, he thought, no more than to Ice. He twitched his burned fingers, feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin. "My lord, you honor me, but..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5538" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当琼恩还在布兰那个年纪的时候，也像所有的男孩子一样，梦想着将来干出一番大事业。虽然每次白日梦的细节都不同，但他总想像自己救了父亲一命，事后艾德公爵宣布琼恩已经证明了自己是真正的史塔克传人，并将“寒冰”交到他手中。即便在当时，他也知道这不过是小孩子的玩笑，私生子是绝不可能继承家传宝剑的。如今想起这些，他却觉得羞耻。夺走自己兄弟的继承权，这算什么?我没资格接受这把剑，他心想，一如我没资格继承“寒冰”。他动动灼伤的手指，感觉到皮肤底下深层的痛楚。“大人，您让我受宠若惊，可是——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5539');"><p>"Spare me your but’s, boy," Lord Mormont interrupted. "I would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours. You fought bravely?.?.?.?and more to the point, you thought quickly. Fire! Yes, damn it. We ought to have known. We ought to have remembered. The Long Night has come before. Oh, eight thousand years is a good while, to be sure?.?.?.?yet if the Night’s Watch does not remember, who will?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5539" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小子，少跟我‘可是’。”莫尔蒙司令打断他。“若不是你和你那头狼，我现在就不会坐在这里了。你不仅勇敢……更重要的是，你的脑筋动得快。没错，天杀的，就是用火!我们早该知道，早该想起来。古时也曾有过长夜之劫，唉，八千年虽然久了点……可若是连守夜人都不记得，还有谁会记得呢? ”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5540');"><p>"Who will," chimed the talkative raven. "Who will."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5540" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谁会!”聒噪的乌鸦跟着叫，“谁会!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5541');"><p>Truly, the gods had heard Jon’s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man’s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood. Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames. It was the face that haunted him most; surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw, the dead flesh melting away and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5541" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那天晚上，诸神确是听见了琼恩的祈祷；尸鬼的衣服一着火，瞬间便被烈焰吞噬，仿佛它的皮肤是蜡油，骨头是干柴。琼恩只需闭上眼睛，依然可以见到那具尸体踉跄着走过书房，四处碰撞家具，挥舞双臂拍打火焰的景象。萦绕心头久久不去的是那张脸：四周为火围绕，头发燃如稻草，坏死的肌肉一块块熔解滑落，露出下面的颅骨。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5542');"><p>Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone. Yet in his nightmare he faced it again?.?.?.?and this time the burning corpse wore Lord Eddard’s features. It was his father’s skin that burst and blackened, his father’s eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears. Jon did not understand why that should be or what it might mean, but it frightened him more than he could say.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5542" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>不管驱使奥瑟的是何种恶魔力量，都已被烈火赶走；他们在余烬堆里找到的那团扭曲东西，只不过是烤熟的人肉和烧焦的骨头罢了。然而在他的噩梦里，它又再度到来……这次冒火的尸体头上生着艾德公爵的容貌。焦黑爆突的是父亲的皮肤，如结冻眼泪般流下脸颊的是父亲的眼睛。琼恩不明白为何会做这种梦，也不了解这代表的意义，他只是吓坏了。，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5543');"><p>"A sword’s small payment for a life," Mormont concluded. "Take it, I’ll hear no more of it, is that understood?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5543" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一剑换一命，够便宜了”莫尔蒙总结。“快拿去，别再跟我哕唆，听懂了没?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5544');"><p>"Yes, my lord." The soft leather gave beneath Jon’s fingers, as if the sword were molding itself to his grip already. He knew he should be honored, and he was, and yet?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_5544" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是，大人。”琼恩的手指抚摩着柔软的皮革，这把剑似乎迫不及待地渴望他的掌握。他明白，这是莫大的荣耀，他也的确非常感激，可是…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5545');"><p>He is not my father. The thought leapt unbidden to Jon’s mind. Lord Eddard Stark is my father. I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me. Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it was another man’s sword he dreamt of?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_5545" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他不是我父亲，这个念头毫无预警地跃上琼恩心头。艾德•史塔克公爵才是我父亲。我永远不会忘记他，无论别人给我多少把剑，我都不会变。但他怎么能对莫尔蒙司令说他梦想的是另一个人的剑呢……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5546');"><p>"I want no courtesies either," Mormont said, "so thank me no thanks. Honor the steel with deeds, not words."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5546" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我也不想听什么客套话，”莫尔蒙道，“所以把道谢都省了罢。用实际行动证明你珍惜它，比说多少废话都管用。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5547');"><p>Jon nodded. "Does it have a name, my lord?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5547" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩点点头。“大人，这把剑可有名讳?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5548');"><p>"It did, once. Longclaw, it was called."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5548" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“以前是有的。名叫‘长爪’。”

The fire he’d started had not, in truth, burned down that formidable stone tower, but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors, where the Old Bear had his chambers. No one seemed to mind that very much, since it had also destroyed Othor’s murderous corpse.

Ser Jaremy had finished the job of hacking its head off, yet had died all the same when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels.

It was not their fault, truly; they had not had to face Othor, they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes, had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers. Nor did they know of the fighting in the riverlands. How could they hope to comprehend? He turned away from them abruptly and strode off, sullen. Pyp called after him, but Jon paid him no mind.

He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage, and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter. Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece.

He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor himself, not even for love, yet inside a small sly voice whispered, He fathered a bastard, where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of his duty to her, he will not even say her name. "He would do whatever was right," he said?.?.?.?ringingly, to make up for his hesitation. "No matter what."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5601" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩迟疑了。他想说艾德公爵绝对不会做出有损名誉的事，即使为了情爱也不例外。然而他心中却有个狡诈的声音在悄悄低语：他有个私生子，这有何荣誉可言? 还有你母亲啊，他负起过对她的责任吗? 他连她的名字都不肯讲! “他会做他该做的事，”他刻意拖长音调，借此掩饰自己的犹豫不决。“不管那是什么。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5602');"><p>"Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman’s love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms?.?.?.?or the memory of a brother’s smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5602" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么，艾德大人是万里挑一的人才。多数人不若他这么坚强。跟女人的情爱相比，荣誉算得了什么? 当你怀抱初生幼儿……或是想起兄弟的笑容，责任又算得了什么?不过都是虚幻，都是空谈罢了。我们身为凡人，天上诸神使我们有能力去爱，那是对我们最美好的恩赐，却也是我们最深沉的悲哀。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5604');"><p>"Yet brothers they had, and sisters. Mothers who gave them birth, fathers who gave them names. They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms, and they knew times may change, but men do not. So they pledged as well that the Night’s Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5604" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“然而人皆有父母，皆有兄弟姐妹。他们来自纷争不断的大小王国，也深知时局虽改，人性终究不变。于是他们立下誓言：守夜人守护王国，但绝不参与其中任何战役。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5605');"><p>"They kept their pledge. When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his kingdom, Harren’s brother was Lord Commander on the Wall, with ten thousand swords to hand. He did not march. In the days when the Seven Kingdoms were seven kingdoms, not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war. The Watch took no part. When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the kingdoms of the First Men, the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts. So it has always been, for years beyond counting. Such is the price of honor.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5606');"><p>"A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear. And we all do our duty, when there is no cost to it.

</p></origin><translate id="div_5607" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>有些渡鸦还在吃，细细的肉丝悬挂在长喙边，不住摇晃。大多数乌鸦似乎都看着他。琼恩能感觉每一双细小的黑眼停在他身上的重量。“如今就是我要抉择的时刻……您的意思，是这样吗?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5608');"><p>Maester Aemon turned his head and looked at him with those dead white eyes. It was as if he were seeing right into his heart. Jon felt naked and exposed. He took the bucket in both hands and flung the rest of the slops through the bars. Strings of meat and blood flew everywhere, scattering the ravens. They took to the air, shrieking wildly. The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped them down greedily. Jon let the empty bucket clang to the floor.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5608" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊蒙师傅转过头，用那双瞎了的白眼“看”着他，仿佛可以看透他的心。琼恩觉得自己赤裸裸的，什么都藏不住。他情不自禁地两手握起桶子，把剩下的碎肉全倒进笼里。肉条和血水，四处飞溅，渡鸦纷纷振翅散开，疯狂尖叫。动作快的在空中叼住肉条，贪婪地大口吞咽。琼恩松开手，任由空桶“咔啦”落地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5609');"><p>The old man laid a withered, spotted hand on his shoulder. "It hurts, boy," he said softly. "Oh, yes. Choosing?.?.?.?it has always hurt. And always will. I know."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5611');"><p>Maester Aemon sighed. "Have you heard nothing I’ve told you, Jon? Do you think you are the first?" He shook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words. "Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows. Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I had grown old. By then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first. My ravens would bring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation. What could I have done, old, blind, frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother’s poor grandson, and his son, and even the little children?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5611" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊蒙师傅叹道：“琼恩，我刚才告诉你的，你难道都没听进去?你难道认为自己是第一个经历考验的人吗?”他摇摇苍老的头，那是个虚弱得难以形容的动作。“天上诸神为我的誓言舔立过三次考验。一次在我年幼，一次我正值壮年，最后一次则在我步入老年之后。那时我已年老体衰，视力渐弱，然而面临的抉择如同第一次那般残酷。渡鸦从南方带来我家族灭亡的消息。黑色的翅膀，黑暗的消息。我的亲人死亡、名声扫地、景况凄凉。但我这个身体虚弱的瞎眼老人能做些什么呢?我像是襁褓中嗷嗷待哺的婴儿一般无助，可一旦想到自己坐在这里，置身事外，听任他们杀害我弟弟可怜的孙子，他的曾孙，还有那些无辜的孩儿……”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5613');"><p>A toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips. "Only a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night’s Watch. In my order, we put aside our house names when we take our vows and don the collar." The old man touched the maester’s chain that hung loosely around his thin, fleshless neck. "My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead. My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was his uncle, or his father, depending on which tale you believe. Aemon, he called me?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5613" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那双老迈的唇微微牵起，露出一张无牙的嘴。“不过就是个自学城毕业，立誓为黑城堡与守夜人奉献心力的学士罢了。在我的组织里，每当我们立下誓言，戴起项链之时，便须抛弃原有的家族姓氏。”老人摸摸挂在自己削瘦脖子上的项链。“我的父亲是梅卡一世，在他之后，我的弟弟伊耿代替我继承王位。我的祖父为我取名伊蒙，用以纪念龙骑士伊蒙王子，也就是他的叔叔，或者他的父亲，看你相信哪个版本的故事。我原名……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5614');"><p>"Aemon?.?.?.?Targaryen?" Jon could scarcely believe it.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5615');"><p>"Once," the old man said. "Once. So you see, Jon, I do know?.?.?.?and knowing, I will not tell you stay or go.

</p></origin><translate id="div_5615" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那是过去的事，”老人说，“过去的事了。所以，琼恩，你看，我的确是明白你的感受……正因为明白，所以我不会要求你留下或是离开。你必须自己做出这个抉择，然后一辈子与之相伴，就像我一样。”他的声音只剩呓语。“就像我一样……”
