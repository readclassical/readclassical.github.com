</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5715');"><p>On a hill overlooking the kingsroad, a long trestle table of rough-hewn pine had been erected beneath an elm tree and covered with a golden cloth. There, beside his pavilion, Lord Tywin took his evening meal with his chief knights and lords bannermen, his great crimson-and-gold standard waving overhead from a lofty pike.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5715" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在一座俯瞡国王大道的丘陵上，搭起了一张原松木做成的折叠长桌，其上铺好了金黄桌布。泰温公爵的大帐就在桌旁，红金相间的大旗飘扬于长竿之上，而他本人便是在此与手下重要骑士和诸侯共进晚餐。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5716');"><p>Tyrion arrived late, saddlesore, and sour, all too vividly aware of how amusing he must look as he waddled up the slope to his father. The day’s march had been long and tiring. He thought he might get quite drunk tonight. It was twilight, and the air was alive with drifting fireflies.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5716" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂到得有些迟，他骑了一整天马，此刻浑身酸痛，摇摇摆摆地爬上缓坡，朝父亲走去，心里十分清楚自己是何等滑稽模样。这天的行军路途漫长，令人筋疲力竭。今晚他打算喝个酩酊大醉。时间已是黄昏，空中满是流萤，仿佛有了生命。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5717');"><p>The cooks were serving the meat course: five suckling pigs, skin seared and crackling, a different fruit in every mouth. The smell made his mouth water. "My pardons," he began, taking his place on the bench beside his uncle.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5717" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>厨子正端上当晚的主菜：五只烤得金黄酥脆，嘴里含着不同水果的乳猪。闻到香味，他口水都流了出来。“不好意思，我迟到了。”他一边说，一边在叔叔身边的板凳上坐下。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5718');"><p>"Perhaps I’d best charge you with burying our dead, Tyrion," Lord Tywin said. "If you are as late to battle as you are to table, the fighting will all be done by the time you arrive."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5718" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“提利昂，我看还是让你去埋葬死者好了。”泰温公爵说，“要是你上战场也跟上餐桌一般慢，等你光临，仗都已经打完了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5719');"><p>"Oh, surely you can save me a peasant or two, Father," Tyrion replied. "Not too many, I wouldn’t want to be greedy." He filled his wine cup and watched a serving man carve into the pig. The crisp skin crackled under his knife, and hot juice ran from the meat. It was the loveliest sight Tyrion had seen in ages.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5719" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎，父亲，留一两个农民给我对付总行吧?”提利昂回答，“不用太多，我这个人向来不贪心。”他自顾自地斟满酒，一边看着仆人切猪肉，松脆的皮在刀子下哔啪作响，滚烫的油汁流下来。提利昂已经很久没见过如此美丽的景象了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5720');"><p>"Ser Addam’s outriders say the Stark host has moved south from the Twins," his father reported as his trencher was filled with slices of pork. "Lord Frey’s levies have joined them. They are likely no more than a day’s march north of us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5720" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“据亚当爵士的斥候报告，史塔克军已从孪河城南下，”父亲一边看着仆人把肉片放进他的木盘，一边说，“佛雷大人的部队加入了他们。此刻敌军就在北边，离我们大概一日行程。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5721');"><p>"Please, Father," Tyrion said. "I’m about to eat."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5721" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“父亲，您行行好，”提利昂说，“我正要开始吃呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5722');"><p>"Does the thought of facing the Stark boy unman you, Tyrion? Your brother Jaime would be eager to come to grips with him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5722" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“提利昂，一想到面对史塔克家那小鬼，你就吓成这样?换成你哥哥詹姆，他只怕会迫不及待想大显身手。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5723');"><p>"I’d sooner come to grips with that pig. Robb Stark is not half so tender, and he never smelled as good."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5723" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我宁可对这头猪大显身手，罗柏•史塔克既没这么嫩，更没这么香。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5724');"><p>Lord Lefford, the sour bird who had charge of their stores and supplies, leaned forward. "I hope your savages do not share your reluctance, else we’ve wasted our good steel on them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5724" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>负责辎重补给的莱佛德伯爵——一个无趣的家伙——向前一靠：“希望你那群野蛮人不像你一样没用，否则我们精良的装备就白白浪费了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5725');"><p>"My savages will put your steel to excellent use, my lord," Tyrion replied. When he had told Lefford he needed arms and armor to equip the three hundred men Ulf had fetched down out of the foothills, you would have thought he’d asked the man to turn his virgin daughters over to their pleasure.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5725" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，我保证我那群野蛮人会让你的装备物尽其用。”提利昂回答。之前，当他告诉莱佛德需要武器和护甲，用来装备乌尔夫从山上找来那三百人时，莱佛德的表情活像是别人要他交出自己的闺女。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5726');"><p>Lord Lefford frowned. "I saw that great hairy one today, the one who insisted that he must have two battle-axes, the heavy black steel ones with twin crescent blades."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5726" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱佛德伯爵皱起眉头。“我今天碰见了那个浑身是毛的高个子家伙坚持要拿两把战斧。他挑的可都是黑色重钢打造，两面月刃的上等货色。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5727');"><p>"Shagga likes to kill with either hand," Tyrion said as a trencher of steaming pork was laid in front of him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5727" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夏嘎喜欢双手操家伙。”提利昂看着侍者把一盘冒烟的烤猪肉放在面前，一边说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5728');"><p>"He still had that wood-axe of his strapped to his back."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5728" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他自己那柄木斧还挂在背后。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5729');"><p>"Shagga is of the opinion that three axes are even better than two." Tyrion reached a thumb and forefinger into the salt dish, and sprinkled a healthy pinch over his meat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5729" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想夏嘎的意思是，三把斧头肯定比两把好。”提利昂伸出拇指和食指探进盐碟，在肉上洒了一大把。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5730');"><p>Ser Kevan leaned forward. "We had a thought to put you and your wildlings in the vanguard when we come to battle."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5730" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时凯冯爵士倾身向前：“我们有个想法，开战的时候，打算把你和你那群野人放在前锋。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5731');"><p>Ser Kevan seldom "had a thought" that Lord Tywin had not had first. Tyrion had skewered a chunk of meat on the point of his dagger and brought it to his mouth. Now he lowered it. "The vanguard?" he repeated dubiously. Either his lord father had a new respect for Tyrion’s abilities, or he’d decided to rid himself of his embarrassing get for good. Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he knew which.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5731" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯冯爵士的“想法”通常都是泰温公爵的主意。提利昂原本已拿匕旨刺好一块肉，正往嘴边送，一听此言连忙放下。“前锋?”他有些怀疑地重复。若不是父亲大人对他的能力突然产生了敬意，就是打算彻底除掉这个老让他出丑的儿子。至于是前者，还是后者，提利昂有种不祥的预感。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5732');"><p>"They seem ferocious enough," Ser Kevan said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5732" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们看起来很威猛。”凯冯爵士道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5733');"><p>"Ferocious?" Tyrion realized he was echoing his uncle like a trained bird. His father watched, judging him, weighing every word. "Let me tell you how ferocious they are. Last night, a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. So today as we made camp three Stone Crows seized the man and opened his throat for him. Perhaps they were hoping to get the sausage back, I couldn’t say. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man’s cock, which was fortunate, but even so Ulf is demanding blood money, which Conn and Shagga refuse to pay."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5733" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“威猛?”提利昴突然惊觉自己像只训练有素的乌儿一样不断重复叔叔的话。父亲则在旁观看，严加审度，仔细衡量他所说的每一个字。“让我告诉你他们有多威猛。昨天晚上，有个月人部的家伙为了一根香肠，捅死了一个石鸦部的人。所以呢，今天我们扎营时，三个石鸦部的人抓住凶手，割开他的喉咙为同伴报仇。或许他们想拿回香肠，我不确定。波隆好不容易才阻止夏嘎剁掉那死人的老二，算是不聿中的大幸。即便如此，乌尔夫还坚决要求对方为这个血债付出赔偿金，可康恩和夏嘎不肯。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5734');"><p>"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their lord commander," his father said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5734" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“士兵缺乏纪律，表示指挥官领导无方。”父亲说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5735');"><p>His brother Jaime had always been able to make men follow him eagerly, and die for him if need be. Tyrion lacked that gift. He bought loyalty with gold, and compelled obedience with his name. "A bigger man would be able to put the fear in them, is that what you’re saying, my lord?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5735" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哥哥詹姆总有办法使人忠心追随，甚至赔上性命都在所不惜，提利昂可没这本领。他拿黄金换取忠诚，用姓氏使人服从。“您的意思是，换成个子高点的人，可以多些威严，吓他们不敢乱来，对吧，大人?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5736');"><p>Lord Tywin Lannister turned to his brother. "If my son’s men will not obey his commands, perhaps the vanguard is not the place for him. No doubt he would be more comfortable in the rear, guarding our baggage train."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5736" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>泰温•兰尼斯特公爵转向弟弟。“若我儿子的手下不愿服从他的命令，那么前锋显然不适合他。毫无疑问，应该让他殿后，负责保护辎重货车。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5737');"><p>"Do me no kindnesses, Father," he said angrily. "If you have no other command to offer me, I’ll lead your van."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5737" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“父亲，不需要这么替我着想。”他怒道，“如果您没别的地方给我指挥，就让我来率领前锋。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5738');"><p>Lord Tywin studied his dwarf son. "I said nothing about command. You will serve under Ser Gregor."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5738" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>泰温公爵打量着他的侏儒儿子。“我可没说让你指挥，你是格雷果爵士的部属。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5739');"><p>Tyrion took one bite of pork, chewed a moment, and spit it out angrily. "I find I am not hungry after all," he said, climbing awkwardly off the bench. "Pray excuse me, my lords."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5739" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂咬了口猪肉，嚼了两下，然后愤怒地吐出来。“我发现自己一点也不饿。”说着他别扭地爬下长凳。“诸位大人，我先告退了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5740');"><p>Lord Tywin inclined his head, dismissing him. Tyrion turned and walked away. He was conscious of their eyes on his back as he waddled down the hill. A great gust of laughter went up from behind him, but he did not look back. He hoped they all choked on their suckling pigs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5740" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>泰温公爵点头同意。捉利昂转身一跛一跛地走下山丘，心里很清楚身后众人的目光。一阵哄笑传来，但他没有回头，只暗自希望他们最好都被乳猪噎死。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5741');"><p>Dusk had settled, turning all the banners black. The Lannister camp sprawled for miles between the river and the kingsroad. In amongst the men and the horses and the trees, it was easy to get lost, and Tyrion did. He passed a dozen great pavilions and a hundred cookfires. Fireflies drifted amongst the tents like wandering stars. He caught the scent of garlic sausage, spiced and savory, so tempting it made his empty stomach growl. Away in the distance, he heard voices raised in some bawdy song. A giggling woman raced past him, naked beneath a dark cloak, her drunken pursuer stumbling over tree roots. Farther on, two spearmen faced each other across a little trickle of a stream, practicing their thrust-and-parry in the fading light, their chests bare and slick with sweat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5741" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>夜幕已然低垂，将所有旗臶染成黑色。兰尼斯特军的营地位于河流和国王大道之间，绵延数里。在众多人马和树林之中，非常容易迷路。果不其然，提利昂茫然地走过十几个大帐篷和百余座营火，忽然迷失了方向。萤火虫在营帐间窜动，有如游荡的星星。他闻到蒜肠的香味，辛辣又可口，令他空空的肚腹饥肠辘辘。他听见远处有人唱起情色小曲，一个女人咯咯笑着从身边跑过，身上只盖了件深色斗篷，一个醉酒的人追在她后面，没两步就被树根绊倒。更远的地方，两名长矛兵隔着小溪，就着渐渐黯淡的天光，练习格挡和突刺的技巧，赤裸的胸膛上大汗淋漓。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5742');"><p>No one looked at him. No one spoke to him. No one paid him any mind. He was surrounded by men sworn to House Lannister, a vast host twenty thousand strong, and yet he was alone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5742" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>无人看他一眼，无人与他交谈，无人注意到他。在他周围，全是宣誓效忠兰尼斯特家族的部属，一共多达两万人的庞大军团。然而他，却孤独无依。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5743');"><p>When he heard the deep rumble of Shagga’s laughter booming through the dark, he followed it to the Stone Crows in their small corner of the night. Conn son of Coratt waved a tankard of ale. "Tyrion Halfman! Come, sit by our fire, share meat with the Stone Crows. We have an ox."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5743" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>后来，他总算听到夏嘎低沉浑厚的笑声透过夜色轰隆传来，便循着笑声，找到石鸦部过夜的小角落。科拉特之子康恩朝他挥挥一大杯麦酒。“半人提利昂!过来，来我们火边坐坐，跟石鸦部一起吃肉，我们弄到一头牛。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5744');"><p>"I can see that, Conn son of Coratt." The huge red carcass was suspended over a roaring fire, skewered on a spit the size of a small tree. No doubt it was a small tree. Blood and grease dripped down into the flames as two Stone Crows turned the meat. "I thank you. Send for me when the ox is cooked." From the look of it, that might even be before the battle. He walked on.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5744" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我看到了，科拉特之子康恩。”巨大的血红牛尸被架在熊熊营火之上，用一根粗如小树的烤肉叉串起——恐怕那根叉子原本就是一棵小树罢。鲜血和油汁滴落火焰中，两个石鸦部的人合力转着牛。“谢谢你，等牛烤好后叫我一声。”依目前的情形看来，或许能赶在开战前吃到。他继续往前走。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5745');"><p>Each clan had its own cookfire; Black Ears did not eat with Stone Crows, Stone Crows did not eat with Moon Brothers, and no one ate with Burned Men. The modest tent he had coaxed out of Lord Lefford’s stores had been erected in the center of the four fires. Tyrion found Bronn sharing a skin of wine with the new servants. Lord Tywin had sent him a groom and a body servant to see to his needs, and even insisted he take a squire. They were seated around the embers of a small cookfire. A girl was with them; slim, dark-haired, no more than eighteen by the look of her. Tyrion studied her face for a moment, before he spied fishbones in the ashes. "What did you eat?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5745" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>每个部落都生了自己的营火；黑耳部不和石鸦部共食，石鸦部不和月人部共食，而任何部落都不和灼人部共食。他好不容易才从莱佛德伯爵那儿弄来的帐篷，就位于四部营火中间。来到帐前，提利昂发现波隆正和他新来的仆人们喝酒。泰温公爵派来一个马夫和一个贴身仆人照料他起居，甚至还坚持他应该带个侍从。他们围坐在小营火的灰烬旁，在场的还有个女孩，纤细、黑发，看来不超过十八岁。提利昂打量了她一会儿，这才瞥见火烬里的鱼骨头。“你们吃了什么? ”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5746');"><p>"Trout, m’lord," said his groom. "Bronn caught them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5746" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，是鳟鱼。”他的马夫说，“波隆抓的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5747');"><p>Trout, he thought. Suckling pig. Damn my father. He stared mournfully at the bones, his belly rumbling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5747" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鳟鱼，他心想，烤乳猪。父亲真该死。他有些哀怨地望着鱼骨，肚子咕噜叫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5748');"><p>His squire, a boy with the unfortunate name of Podrick Payne, swallowed whatever he had been about to say. The lad was a distant cousin to Ser Ilyn Payne, the king’s headsman?.?.?.?and almost as quiet, although not for want of a tongue. Tyrion had made him stick it out once, just to be certain. "Definitely a tongue," he had said. "Someday you must learn to use it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5748" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的侍从把原本要说的话吞了下去，这孩子很不幸地姓了派恩，波德瑞克•派恩，是御前执法官伊林•派恩爵士的远亲……几乎和他一样沉默寡言，虽然并非没有舌头。某一天，提利昂叫他把舌头吐出来，确定一下。“的确是舌头，”他评说，“哪天你总得学着用。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5749');"><p>At the moment, he did not have the patience to try and coax a thought out of the lad, whom he suspected had been inflicted on him as a cruel jape. Tyrion turned his attention back to the girl. "Is this her?" he asked Bronn.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5749" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>今天这种时候，他可没耐性去套那孩子的话。他更怀疑父亲派这小鬼来当侍从，根本是个恶意的玩笑。于是提利昂把注意力转移到女孩身上。“就是她?”他问波隆。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5750');"><p>She rose gracefully and looked down at him from the lofty height of five feet or more. "It is, m’lord, and she can speak for herself, if it please you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5750" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她优雅地起身，从五尺多的高度俯瞡他。“是的，大人，而且她自己会说话，如果您高兴的话。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5751');"><p>He cocked his head to one side. "I am Tyrion, of House Lannister. Men call me the Imp."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5751" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他歪歪头。“我是兰尼斯特家族的提利昴，别人叫我小恶魔。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5752');"><p>"My mother named me Shae. Men call me?.?.?.?often."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5752" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我母亲为我取名雪伊，别人也常这样叫……我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5753');"><p>Bronn laughed, and Tyrion had to smile. "Into the tent, Shae, if you would be so kind." He lifted the flap and held it for her. Inside, he knelt to light a candle.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5753" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>波隆哈哈大笑，捉利昴也不禁扬起嘴角。“那么，就请进帐罢，雪伊。”他为她掀起帷幕，进去之后，燃起一支蜡烛。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5754');"><p>The life of a soldier was not without certain compensations. Wherever you have a camp, you are certain to have camp followers. At the end of the day’s march, Tyrion had sent Bronn back to find him a likely whore. "I would prefer one who is reasonably young, with as pretty a face as you can find," he had said. "If she has washed sometime this year, I shall be glad. If she hasn’t, wash her. Be certain that you tell her who I am, and warn her of what I am." Jyck had not always troubled to do that. There was a look the girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling they’d been hired to pleasure?.?.?.?a took that Tyrion Lannister did not ever care to see again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5754" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>军旅生活多少有些补偿，无论在何处扎营，必定有人循踪而至。今天行军结束时，提利昂叫波隆去给他找个像样的营妓。“最好年轻一点的，当然，越漂亮越好。”他说，“如果她今年洗过澡，那最好，如果没有，把她先洗干净。务必告诉她我的身份，以及我是什么德行。”杰克以前通常懒得说明，于是许多女孩初次见到这位她们受雇服侍的贵族少爷时，眼底的神情便油然而生……那是一种提利昂•兰尼斯特这辈子难以忍受的神情。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5755');"><p>He lifted the candle and looked her over. Bronn had done well enough; she was doe-eyed and slim, with small firm breasts and a smile that was by turns shy, insolent, and wicked. He liked that. "Shall I take my gown off, m’lord?" she asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5755" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他拿起蜡烛，把她仔细打量一番。波隆眼光不错：她生得一双雌鹿般的眸子，身形纤细，乳房小而结实，脸上的笑容时而羞怯、时而傲慢、时而邪恶。他挺满意。“大人，要我脱衣服吗?”她问。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5756');"><p>"In good time. Are you a maiden, Shae?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5756" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“稍等，雪伊，你是处女吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5757');"><p>"If it please you, m’lord," she said demurely.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5757" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，您高兴的话，就这样想吧。”她故作庄重地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5758');"><p>"What would please me would be the truth of you, girl."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5758" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小妹妹，知道真相我才会高兴。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5759');"><p>"Aye, but that will cost you double."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5759" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是吗?那您得付双倍的钱。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5760');"><p>Tyrion decided they would get along splendidly. "I am a Lannister. Gold I have in plenty, and you’ll find me generous ?.?.?.?but I’ll want more from you than what you’ve got between your legs, though I’ll want that too. You’ll share my tent, pour my wine, laugh at my jests, rub the ache from my legs after each day’s ride?.?.?.?and whether I keep you a day or a year, for so long as we are together you will take no other men into your bed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5760" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂认为他们简直是绝配。“我是兰尼斯特家的人，有的是黄金，你会发现我是个很慷慨的人……但我要的不只是你两煺间的东西——当然那个我肯定要。我要你和我一起住，为我倒酒，陪我说笑，每天在我奔波之后替我按摩双脚……而且，不管我留你一天还是一年，只要我们在一起，你就不许跟其他男人上床。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5761');"><p>"Fair enough." She reached down to the hem of her thin roughspun gown and pulled it up over her head in one smooth motion, tossing it aside.

The trumpets blew again: hurry hurry hurry. Knights vaulted onto snorting coursers while men-at-arms buckled their sword belts as they ran. When he found Pod, the boy was snoring softly. Tyrion gave him a sharp poke in the ribs with his toe. "My armor," he said, "and be quick about it." Bronn came trotting out of the mists, already armored and ahorse, wearing his battered halfhelm.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5796');"><p>By the time he was dressed, his squire had laid out his armor, such that it was. Tyrion owned a fine suit of heavy plate, expertly crafted to fit his misshapen body. Alas, it was safe at Casterly Rock, and he was not. He had to make do with oddments assembled from Lord Lefford’s wagons: mail hauberk and coif, a dead knight’s gorget, lobstered greaves and gauntlets and pointed steel boots. Some of it was ornate, some plain; not a bit of it matched, or fit as it should. His breastplate was meant for a bigger man; for his oversize head, they found a huge bucket-shaped greathelm topped with a foot-long triangular spike.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5796" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等他穿好衣服，侍从已把他的盔甲排好。这身盔甲实在不起眼。提利昂本有一套上好的重铠，特别精心打造，适合他畸形的身体，只可惜而今好端端放在凯岩城，与他相隔千里。他只好将就一下，在莱佛德伯爵的辎重车辆上东拼西凑：锁甲和头套，一名战死骑士的护喉，圆盘扩膝，铁手套和尖角钢靴。其中某几件有装饰，有的①波德是波德瑞克的小名则样式普通，通通都不成套，颇不合身。他的胸甲原本是要给个子更大的人穿的；为了对付他那颗不合比例的大头，他们找来一个水桶状的大盔，顶端有根一尺长的三角尖刺。

Tyrion buckled on his belt, heavy with the weight of shortsword and dirk. By then his groom had brought up his mount, a formidable brown courser armored as heavily as he was. He needed help to mount; he felt as though he weighed a thousand stone. Pod handed him up his shield, a massive slab of heavy ironwood banded with steel. Lastly they gave him his battle-axe. Shae stepped back and looked him over. "M’lord looks fearsome."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5800" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我相信你会。”雪伊为他戴上巨盔，波德随即将之与护喉相连。提利昂扣上腰带，挂好短剑和匕首，沉甸甸的。这时马夫牵来他的坐骑，那是一头结实的棕色大马，身上的护甲和他一样厚实。他得别人帮忙才上得了马，只觉自己如有千石重。波德递上他的铁木镶钢边大盾，然后是他的战斧。雪伊退开一步，上下打量他一番。“大人您看起来很威武。”

Podrick, should the battle go against us, see the lady safely home." He saluted her with his axe, wheeled his horse about, and trotted off. His stomach was a hard knot, so tight it pained him. Behind, his servants hurriedly began to strike his tent. Pale crimson fingers fanned out to the east as the first rays of the sun broke over the horizon. The western sky was a deep purple, speckled with stars. Tyrion wondered whether this was the last sunrise he would ever see?.?.?.?and whether wondering was a mark of cowardice. Did his brother Jaime ever contemplate death before a battle?

The clansmen climbed onto their scrawny mountain horses, shouting curses and rude jokes. Several appeared to be drunk.

What grass the horses had left was heavy with dew, as if some passing god had scattered a bag of diamonds over the earth.

No ordinary clasp would suffice for such a weight, so the greatcloak was held in place by a matched pair of miniature lionesses crouching on his shoulders, as if poised to spring. Their mate, a male with a magnificent mane, reclined atop Lord Tywin’s greathelm, one paw raking the air as he roared. All three lions were wrought in gold, with ruby eyes. His armor was heavy steel plate, enameled in a dark crimson, greaves and gauntlets inlaid with ornate gold scrollwork. His rondels were golden sunbursts, all his fastenings were gilded, and the red steel was burnished to such a high sheen that it shone like fire in the light of the rising sun.

He watched Ser Gregor as the Mountain rode up and down the line, shouting and gesticulating. This wing too was all cavalry, but where the right was a mailed fist of knights and heavy lancers, the vanguard was made up of the sweepings of the west: mounted archers in leather jerkins, a swarming mass of undisciplined freeriders and sellswords, fieldhands on plow horses armed with scythes and their fathers’ rusted swords, half-trained boys from the stews of Lannisport?.?.?.?and Tyrion and his mountain clansmen.

Spears thrust at him from every side, but the shield wall broke beneath his weight. The northerners stumbled away from the animal’s death throes.

Chips of oak went flying, until the northerner lost his feet and slipped, failing flat on his back with his shield on top of him. He was below the reach of Tyrion’s axe and it was too much bother to dismount, so he left him there and rode after another man, taking him from behind with a sweeping downcut that sent a jolt of impact up his arm.

Steel rang on steel, and Tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than he was. Where in the seven hells was Bronn? "Die," the man grunted, chopping at him savagely. Tyrion barely got his shield up in time, and the wood seemed to explode inward under the force of the blow. The shattered pieces fell away from his arm.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5841');"><p>Tyrion groped at the top of the greathelm. The spike had snapped off clean. "I haven’t lost it. I know just where it is. Do you see my horse?"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5842');"><p>By the time they found it, the trumpets had sounded again and Lord Tywin’s reserve came sweeping up along the river. Tyrion watched his father fly past, the crimson-and-gold banner of Lannister rippling over his head as he thundered across the field. Five hundred knights surrounded him, sunlight flashing off the points of their lances. The remnants of the Stark lines shattered like glass beneath the hammer of their charge.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5842" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等他们找到马，喇叭又再度响起，泰温公爵的预备队倾巢而出，沿着河岸朝敌军冲去。提利昂看着父亲急驰而过，身边围绕着五百名骑士，阳光在枪尖闪耀，兰尼斯特家族的红金旗臶在头顶飞扬。史塔克家的残余部队在冲击下彻底溃散，有如被铁锤敲打的玻璃。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5843');"><p>With his elbow swollen and throbbing inside his armor, Tyrion made no attempt to join the slaughter. He and Bronn went looking for his men. Many he found among the dead. Ulf son of Umar lay in a pool of congealing blood, his arm gone at the elbow, a dozen of his Moon Brothers sprawled around him. Shagga was slumped beneath a tree, riddled with arrows, Conn’s head in his lap. Tyrion thought they were both dead, but as he dismounted, Shagga opened his eyes and said, "They have killed Conn son of Coratt." Handsome Conn had no mark but for the red stain over his breast, where the spear thrust had killed him. When Bronn pulled Shagga to his feet, the big man seemed to notice the arrows for the first time. He plucked them out one by one, cursing the holes they had made in his layers of mail and leather, and yowling like a babe at the few that had buried themselves in his flesh. Chella daughter of Cheyk rode up as they were yanking arrows out of Shagga, and showed them four ears she had taken. Timett they discovered looting the bodies of the slain with his Burned Men. Of the three hundred clansmen who had ridden to battle behind Tyrion Lannister, perhaps half had survived.

Lord Tywin was seated by the river, sipping wine from a jeweled cup as his squire undid the fastenings on his breastplate. "A fine victory," Ser Kevan said when he saw Tyrion. "Your wild men fought well."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5846');"><p>Lord Tywin drained his cup, his face expressionless. "I put the least disciplined men on the left, yes. I anticipated that they would break. Robb Stark is a green boy, more like to be brave than wise. I’d hoped that if he saw our left collapse, he might plunge into the gap, eager for a rout. Once he was fully committed, Ser Kevan’s pikes would wheel and take him in the flank, driving him into the river while I brought up the reserve."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5846" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>泰温公爵一饮而尽，脸上毫无表情。“是的，我把无纪律的部队安排在左翼，预期他们会溃败。罗柏•史塔克是个毛头小鬼，想必勇气多于睿臹，我原本希望他一见我左军崩溃，便全力突进，企图侧面包抄。等他进了圈套，凯冯爵士的长枪兵便会转身攻他侧翼，把他逼进河里，这时我再派出预备队。”

Tywin Lannister rose to his feet as Ser Addam Marbrand leapt down off his courser. The horse was lathered and bleeding from the mouth. Ser Addam dropped to one knee, a rangy man with dark copper hair that fell to his shoulders, armored in burnished bronzed steel with the fiery tree of his House etched black on his breastplate. "My liege, we have taken some of their commanders. Lord Cerwyn, Ser Wylis Manderly, Harrion Karstark, four Freys. Lord Hornwood is dead, and I fear Roose Bolton has escaped us."
