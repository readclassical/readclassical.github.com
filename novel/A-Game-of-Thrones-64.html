</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5857');"><p>The woods were full of whispers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5857" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>林间轻响，絮绕耳际。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5858');"><p>Moonlight winked on the tumbling waters of the stream below as it wound its rocky way along the floor of the valley. Beneath the trees, warhorses whickered softly and pawed at the moist, leafy ground, while men made nervous jests in hushed voices. Now and again, she heard the chink of spears, the faint metallic slither of chain mail, but even those sounds were muffled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5858" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>谷底溪水奔流，蜿蜒穿过石板河床，月光在水面粼粼波动。树下，战马轻声嘶鸣，伸蹄扒开覆满落叶的湿软地面。人们压低声音，紧张地开着玩笑。她不时听见长枪的碰撞和锁子甲滑动所发出的微弱声响，但即便这些声音，也显得朦胧模糊。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5859');"><p>"It should not be long now, my lady," Hallis Mollen said. He had asked for the honor of protecting her in the battle to come; it was his right, as Winterfell’s captain of guards, and Robb had not refused it to him. She had thirty men around her, charged to keep her unharmed and see her safely home to Winterfell if the fighting went against them. Robb had wanted fifty; Catelyn had insisted that ten would be enough, that he would need every sword for the fight. They made their peace at thirty, neither happy with it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5859" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，等不了多久了。”哈里斯•莫兰道。他要求在这场战事中有幸担负起保护她的责任，身为临冬城侍卫队长，这本是他的权利，罗柏也没拒绝。她身边还围绕着三十个卫士，他们的任务只是保护她免遭任何伤害，倘若战事不利，则务必将她安然护送回临冬城。罗柏原本要派出五十人，凯特琳坚持这场仗他需要所有的人手，因此十个就够了，最后他们达成妥协，改派三十名卫士，但双方都怏怏不乐。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5860');"><p>"It will come when it comes," Catelyn told him. When it came, she knew it would mean death. Hal’s death perhaps?.?.?.?or hers, or Robb’s. No one was safe. No life was certain. Catelyn was content to wait, to listen to the whispers in the woods and the faint music of the brook, to feel the warm wind in her hair.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5860" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“该来的时刻自然会来。”凯特琳告诉他。当战事到来的时刻，她知道那将意味着死亡，或许是哈尔的死……也或许是她的，甚至是罗柏。在战争中无人安全，任何人的性命都有危险，所以凯特琳宁愿等待，静听林间轻响、溪涧乐音，感受暖风拂过发丝。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5861');"><p>She was no stranger to waiting, after all. Her men had always made her wait. "Watch for me, little cat," her father would always tell her, when he rode off to court or fair or battle. And she would, standing patiently on the battlements of Riverrun as the waters of the Red Fork and the Tumblestone flowed by. He did not always come when he said he would, and days would ofttimes pass as Catelyn stood her vigil, peering out between crenels and through arrow loops until she caught a glimpse of Lord Hoster on his old brown gelding, trotting along the rivershore toward the landing. "Did you watch for me?" he’d ask when he bent to bug her. "Did you, little cat?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5861" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>再怎么说，等待对她来说毫不陌生，她生命中的男人总是让她等待。“小凯特，等我回来哟。”每次父亲上朝、上集或远赴沙场，总是这么对她说。她也乖乖听话，耐心地站在奔流城的城垛上，看着红叉河和腾石河水奔涌流过。他每每不能准时归来，于是凯特琳也在城墙上终日守望，透过雉堞和箭孔向外眺望，直到终于瞥见霍斯特公爵骑着那头棕色老马，沿着河岸，快步朝渡口奔来。 “你有没有等我啊?”当他弯身搂抱她时，一定会这么问，“有没有啊？凯特? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5862');"><p>Brandon Stark had bid her wait as well. "I shall not be long, my lady," he had vowed. "We will be wed on my return." Yet when the day came at last, it was his brother Eddard who stood beside her in the sept.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5862" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰登•史塔克也教她等了好久。“夫人，此行不会太长。”他曾郑重发誓，“等我回来，咱们便可成婚。”然而当成婚那天终于来临，与她并肩站在圣堂的却是他的弟弟艾德。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5863');"><p>Ned had lingered scarcely a fortnight with his new bride before he too had ridden off to war with promises on his lips. At least he had left her with more than words; he had given her a son. Nine moons had waxed and waned, and Robb had been born in Riverrun while his father still warred in the south. She had brought him forth in blood and pain, not knowing whether Ned would ever see him. Her son. He had been so small?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_5863" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德与新娘相守不足两周，便又快马赶赴战场，只留下一个又一个承诺。好歹他留下的不只是空洞的话语，他还给了她一个儿子。月盈月缺，转眼九个月过去，罗柏诞生于奔流城，他的父亲却还在南方作战。她历经莫大痛苦，把浑身是血的罗柏带来人世，却不知奈德今生有无机会见到他。她的儿子啊，当时的他好小好小……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5864');"><p>And now it was for Robb that she waited?.?.?.?for Robb, and for Jaime Lannister, the gilded knight who men said had never learned to wait at all. "The Kingslayer is restless, and quick to anger," her uncle Brynden had told Robb. And he had wagered their lives and their best hope of victory on the truth of what he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5864" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>如今，她等待的对象变成了罗柏……以及詹姆•兰尼斯特，那个金光闪闪，传说从不知等待为何物的骑士。“弑君者暴躁易怒。”布林登叔叔对罗柏这么说，他则以所有人的性命和惟一的希望为赌注，押在这句话上面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5865');"><p>If Robb was frightened, he gave no sign of it. Catelyn watched her son as he moved among the men, touching one on the shoulder, sharing a jest with another, helping a third to gentle an anxious horse. His armor clinked softly when he moved. Only his head was bare. Catelyn watched a breeze stir his auburn hair, so like her own, and wondered when her son had grown so big. Fifteen, and near as tall as she was.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5865" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏即便心里害怕，也一点没表现出来。凯特琳看着他在队伍里走动，拍拍这人肩膀，和那人同声说笑，又协助另一人安抚焦躁不安的马匹。他的盔甲随着移动轻声作响，全身上下只有头部暴露在外。微风吹动他的枣红头发，那头和自己一模一样的红发，她不禁讶异儿子何时长得这么高大。才十五岁呢，已经快跟她一般高了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5866');"><p>Let him grow taller, she asked the gods. Let him know sixteen, and twenty, and fifty. Let him grow as tall as his father, and hold his own son in his arms. Please, please, please. As she watched him, this tall young man with the new beard and the direwolf prowling at his heels, all she could see was the babe they had laid at her breast at Riverrun, so long ago.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5866" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>请让他长得更高，她祈求天上诸神，让他活过十六岁、二十岁、五十岁，让他变得和他父亲一样高大，让他有机会把儿子抱在怀中，求求你们，求求你们，求求你们。她看着面前这个留了新胡子，脚边跟了一条冰原狼的高大青年，眼中所见却是那个他们放在她怀中的小婴儿。那是好久好久以前，发生在奔流城的事了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5867');"><p>The night was warm, but the thought of Riverrun was enough to make her shiver. Where are they? she wondered. Could her uncle have been wrong? So much rested on the truth of what he had told them. Robb had given the Blackfish three hundred picked men, and sent them ahead to screen his march. "Jaime does not know," Ser Brynden said when he rode back. "I’ll stake my life on that. No bird has reached him, my archers have seen to that. We’ve seen a few of his outriders, but those that saw us did not live to tell of it. He ought to have sent out more. He does not know."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5867" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>夜空虽暖，想到奔流城却令她打起冷颤。他们究竟在哪里?她纳闷。莫非叔叔出错了?一切的一切，都维系在他的承诺上。罗柏拨给黑鱼三百精兵，派他趋前掩护主力部队的行踪。“詹姆不知情，”布林登爵士回来报告，“我敢拿性命担保。我的弓箭手没让任何一只鸟飞回他那里。我们遇到了几个他的斥候，那些人也都无法回去通报了。他应该派出更多人才对。总而言之，他不清楚我们的行踪。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5868');"><p>"How large is his host?" her son asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5868" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他的部队规模如何?”儿子问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5869');"><p>"Twelve thousand foot, scattered around the castle in three separate camps, with the rivers between," her uncle said, with the craggy smile she remembered so well. "There is no other way to besiege Riverrun, yet still, that will be their undoing. Two or three thousand horse."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5869" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“总共一万两千步兵，分居三处营地，散于城堡周围，彼此间有河水相隔。”叔叔边说边露出一抹粗犷的微笑，令她觉得好熟悉。“包围奔流城，这是惟一的方法，但这也将是他们的致命伤。对方的骑兵约莫两三千。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5870');"><p>"The Kingslayer has us three to one," said Galbart Glover.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5870" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“弑君者的兵力将近我们三倍。”盖伯特•葛洛佛道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5871');"><p>‘True enough," Ser Brynden said, "yet there is one thing Ser Jaime lacks."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5871" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不错，”布林登爵士，“但詹姆爵士缺乏一样东西。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5872');"><p>"Yes?" Robb asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5872" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“缺什么? ”罗柏问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5873');"><p>"Patience."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5873" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“耐心。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5874');"><p>Their host was greater than it had been when they left the Twins. Lord Jason Mallister had brought his power out from Seagard to join them as they swept around the headwaters of the Blue Fork and galloped south, and others had crept forth as well, hedge knights and small lords and masterless men-at-arms who had fled north when her brother Edmure’s army was shattered beneath the walls of Riverrun. They had driven their horses as hard as they dared to reach this place before Jaime Lannister had word of their coming, and now the hour was at hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5874" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>比之刚离开孪河城时，他们目前的兵力又增加了不少。绕过蓝叉河源头，调头往南急驰时，杰森•梅利斯特伯爵从海疆城带兵前来助阵，其他生力军也陆续加入，包括雇佣骑士、小诸侯和没了主子的散兵，他们是在她弟弟艾德慕的军队于奔流城下被击溃后，逃往北方的。人们极尽所能，催马前进，赶在詹姆•兰尼斯特接获消息以前来到此地。眼下，决战时刻已经来临。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5875');"><p>Catelyn watched her son mount up. Olyvar Frey held his horse for him, Lord Walder’s son, two years older than Robb, and ten years younger and more anxious. He strapped Robb’s shield in place and handed up his helm. When he lowered it over the face she loved so well, a tall young knight sat on his grey stallion where her son had been. It was dark among the trees, where the moon did not reach. When Robb turned his head to look at her, she could see only black inside his visor. "I must ride down the line, Mother," he told her. "Father says you should let the men see you before a battle."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5875" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳看着儿子上马，瓦德侯爵的儿子奥利法•佛雷则为他拉住缰绳。奥利法较罗柏年长两岁，却幼臻得活像小他十岁，处处显得焦躁不安。他替罗柏绑好盾牌，递上头盔。儿子放下面罩，盖住那张她所深爱的脸庞，摇身一变，成为高大英挺的年轻骑士，端坐于灰色骏马之上。树林极暗，月光无法照及，所以当罗柏转头看她，面罩之下，她只见一片漆黑。“母亲，我得上前线去。”他告诉她，“父亲教导我，开战之前，要让部下看到首领与他们同在。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5876');"><p>‘Go, then," she said. "Let them see you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5876" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“去罢，”她说，“让他们好好看看你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5877');"><p>‘It will give them courage," Robb said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5877" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我会给他们勇气。”罗柏道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5878');"><p>And who will give me courage? she wondered, yet she kept her silence and made herself smile for him. Robb turned the big grey stallion and walked him slowly away from her, Grey Wind shadowing his steps. Behind him his battle guard formed up. When he’d forced Catelyn to accept her protectors, she had insisted that he be guarded as well, and the lords bannermen had agreed. Many of their sons had clamored for the honor of riding with the Young Wolf, as they had taken to calling him. Torrhen Karstark and his brother Eddard were among his thirty, and Patrek Mallister, Smalljon Umber, Daryn Hornwood, Theon Greyjoy, no less than five of Walder Frey’s vast brood, along with older men like Ser Wendel Manderly and Robin Flint. One of his companions was even a woman: Dacey Mormont, Lady Maege’s eldest daughter and heir to Bear Island, a lanky six-footer who had been given a morningstar at an age when most girls were given dolls. Some of the other lords muttered about that, but Catelyn would not listen to their complaints. "This is not about the honor of your houses," she told them. "This is about keeping my son alive and whole."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5878" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>谁来给我勇气呢?她扪心自问。然而她保持缄默，逼着自己对他微笑。罗柏调转大灰马，缓缓离她远去，灰风如影随形地伴着他，他的贴身护卫们随即跟上。当他强迫凯特琳接受保护时，她坚持他也得照此办理，对此北境诸侯亦表赞同。众多封臣的子嗣都极力争取与少狼主——这是他们帮他新取的称号——并肩作战的荣耀。最后确定的三十人中包括托伦•卡史塔克与艾德•卡史塔克两兄弟，派崔克•梅利斯特，小琼恩•安柏，戴林恩•霍伍德，席恩•葛雷乔伊，瓦德•佛雷众多子孙中的五个，还有较年长的如文德尔•曼德勒爵士和罗宾•菲林特等等。其中甚至有一位女性，黛西•莫尔蒙，梅姬伯爵夫人的长女和熊岛继承人，身形瘦长，高达六尺，别的女孩还在玩洋娃娃的年纪，她便使起了流星锤。对这最后一项指派，诸侯们颇有微词，但凯特琳不理会他们的抱怨。“此事与家族名誉无关，”她告诉他们，“只为了确保我儿毫发无伤。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5879');"><p>And if it comes to that, she wondered, will thirty be enough? Will six thousand be enough?
</p></origin><translate id="div_5879" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>到了生死关头，她心想，这三十人够吗?这里的六千人够吗? 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5880');"><p>A bird called faintly in the distance, a high sharp trill that felt like an icy hand on Catelyn’s neck. Another bird answered; a third, a fourth. She knew their call well enough, from her years at Winterfell. Snow shrikes. Sometimes you saw them in the deep of winter, when the godswood was white and still. They were northern birds.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5880" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>远处传来一声微弱的鸟鸣，那是一种高亢而尖锐的颤音，有如一只冰冷的手，划过凯特琳颈背。又一只鸟颤鸣应和，接着是第三只、第四只。这是雪伯劳的呼唤，在临冬城的这么多年，她早巳非常熟悉。凛冬深雪之时，当神木林白茫茫一片，寂静无声，便能看到它们的踪迹。它们是北方的乌。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5881');"><p>They are coming, Catelyn thought.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5881" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们来了，凯特琳心想。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5882');"><p>"They’re coming, my lady," Hal Mollen whispered. He was always a man for stating the obvious. "Gods be with us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5882" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，他们来了。”哈尔•莫兰悄声道。他总爱重复人尽皆知的事实。“愿诸神与我们同在。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5883');"><p>She nodded as the woods grew still around them. In the quiet she could hear them, far off yet moving closer; the tread of many horses, the rattle of swords and spears and armor, the murmur of human voices, with here a laugh, and there a curse.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5883" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她点点头。周围的树林安静下来，四下寂然之中，她可以听见他们的声音，距离虽远，却在迅速逼近：万马奔腾之声，枪剑铠甲交击，战士喃喃自语，笑骂声此起彼落。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5884');"><p>Eons seemed to come and go. The sounds grew louder. She heard more laughter, a shouted command, splashing as they crossed and recrossed the little stream. A horse snorted. A man swore. And then at last she saw him?.?.?.?only for an instant, framed between the branches of the trees as she looked down at the valley floor, yet she knew it was him. Even at a distance, Ser Jaime Lannister was unmistakable. The moonlight had silvered his armor and the gold of his hair, and turned his crimson cloak to black. He was not wearing a helm.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5884" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>亿万年的光阴仿佛来了又去，声音越变越大，她听见更多笑闹，有人发号施令，渡溪时水花飞扬。一匹马在哼气。某个男人在咒骂。最后她看到他了……虽然只是一刹那，虽然只是透过林间细缝望向谷底，但她深知必是他无疑。即便是在这么远的距离，詹姆•兰尼斯特爵士的身影依旧清晰可辨，他的金发金铠被月光染为银白，鲜红披风成了黑色。他没戴头盔。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5885');"><p>He was there and he was gone again, his silvery armor obscured by the trees once more. Others came behind him, long columns of them, knights and sworn swords and freeriders, three quarters of the Lannister horse.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5885" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他甫一出现，便又消失，银色铠甲再度被树丛遮蔽。长长的队伍跟在他身后，包括骑士、誓言骑士和自由骑手，大概占兰尼斯特军骑兵总数的四分之三。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5886');"><p>"He is no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenters build siege towers," Ser Brynden had promised. "He has ridden out with his knights thrice already, to chase down raiders or storm a stubborn holdfast."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5886" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他绝不会乖乖待在营帐里，坐等木匠搭建攻城塔。”布林登爵士曾经保证。“迄今为止，他已三度率骑兵出击，追赶零散的我军或强攻顽抗的庄园。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5887');"><p>Nodding, Robb had studied the map her uncle had drawn him. Ned had taught him to read maps. "Raid him here," he said, pointing. "A few hundred men, no more. Tully banners. When he comes after you, we will be waiting…"his finger moved an inch to the left "…here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5887" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是罗柏点着头，仔细研读他舅舅绘臸的地图。奈德教导他要熟悉地图。“你在这里袭击他，”他指着地图说，“带个两三百人就好，不要多，打着徒利家的旗臶。当他追过来时，我们会在——”他的手指向左移动一寸。“——这里埋伏。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5888');"><p>Here was a hush in the night, moonlight and shadows, a thick carpet of dead leaves underfoot, densely wooded ridges sloping gently down to the streambed, the underbrush thinning as the ground fell away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5888" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这里”，夜幕中的一片寂静，月光倾洒，暗影幢幢，地面铺满厚厚落叶，山脊密林辫布，丘陵缓缓下降，直至河床。地势越低，矮树丛便越见稀疏。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5889');"><p>Here was her son on his stallion, glancing back at her one last time and lifting his sword in salute.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5889" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这里”，他儿子骑在战马上，回望她最后一眼，举剑行礼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5890');"><p>Here was the call of Maege Mormont’s warhorn, a long low blast that rolled down the valley from the east, to tell them that the last of Jaime’s riders had entered the trap.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5890" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这里”，梅姬•莫尔蒙奏出长而低沉的号角，自东侧轰然直下，炸进河谷，通知人们詹姆的部队已然全数进了圈套。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5891');"><p>And Grey Wind threw back his head and howled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5891" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>灰风向后一甩头：仰天长嚎。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5892');"><p>The sound seemed to go right through Catelyn Stark, and she found herself shivering. It was a terrible sound, a frightening sound, yet there was music in it too. For a second she felt something like pity for the Lannisters below. So this is what death sounds like, she thought.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5892" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>狼嗥之声仿佛直直地穿透了凯特琳•史塔克，她发现自己浑身颤抖。这是一种恐怖之声，骇人之声，然而其中如有音律。一时之间，她竟为下方河谷里的兰尼斯特军感到一丝怜悯。这就是死亡之声，她心想。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5893');"><p>HAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo came the answer from the far ridge as the Greatjon winded his own horn. To east and west, the trumpets of the Mallisters and Freys blew vengeance. North, where the valley narrowed and bent like a cocked elbow, Lord Karstark’s warhorns added their own deep, mournful voices to the dark chorus. Men were shouting and horses rearing in the stream below.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5893" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>啊啊呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜——对面山脊传来大琼恩的号声，东西两边，梅利斯特家和佛雷家也吹起了复仇的喇叭。河谷的北口极窄，有如弯曲的手肘转了方向，卡史塔克伯爵的战号从那里传来，低沉浑厚，充满哀悼之音，加入了这场黑暗的大合唱。下方溪谷里，敌军高声叫喊，马儿前脚踢扬。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5894');"><p>The whispering wood let out its breath all at once, as the bowmen Robb had hidden in the branches of the trees let fly their arrows and the night erupted with the screams of men and horses. All around her, the riders raised their lances, and the dirt and leaves that had buried the cruel bright points fell away to reveal the gleam of sharpened steel. "Winterfell!" she heard Robb shout as the arrows sighed again. He moved away from her at a trot, leading his men downhill.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5894" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奉罗柏之命藏身枝干间的弓箭手们齐齐洒下箭雨，呓语森林用力吐出按捺多时的气息，整个夜晚顿时充斥人马哀嚎。她放眼四望，武士们纷纷举起长枪，褪去用来遮掩反光的泥土和树叶，露出锐利无比的残酷尖刀。叫临冬城万岁!”当箭雨再度落下，她听见罗柏高喊。他从她身边急驰向前，当先率领部下朝河谷俯冲。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5895');"><p>Catelyn sat on her horse, unmoving, with Hal Mollen and her guard around her, and she waited as she had waited before, for Brandon and Ned and her father. She was high on the ridge, and the trees hid most of what was going on beneath her. A heartbeat, two, four, and suddenly it was as if she and her protectors were alone in the wood. The rest were melted away into the green.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5896');"><p>Yet when she looked across the valley to the far ridge, she saw the Greatjon’s riders emerge from the darkness beneath the trees. They were in a long line, an endless line, and as they burst from the wood there was an instant, the smallest part of a heartbeat, when all Catelyn saw was the moonlight on the points of their lances, as if a thousand willowisps were coming down the ridge, wreathed in silver flame.

</p></origin><translate id="div_5897" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她眨眨眼。他们不过是人，朝山谷俯冲的战士，要么杀人，要么被杀。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5898');"><p>Afterward, she could not claim she had seen the battle. Yet she could hear, and the valley rang with echoes. The crack of a broken lance, the clash of swords, the cries of "Lannister" and "Winterfell" and "Tully! Riverrun and Tully!" When she realized there was no more to see, she closed her eyes and listened. The battle came alive around her. She heard hoofbeats, iron boots splashing in shallow water, the woody sound of swords on oaken shields and the scrape of steel against steel, the hiss of arrows, the thunder of drums, the terrified screaming of a thousand horses. Men shouted curses and begged for mercy, and got it (or not), and lived (or died). The ridges seemed to play queer tricks with sound. Once she heard Robb’s voice, as clear as if he’d been standing at her side, calling, "To me! To me!" And she heard his direwolf, snarling and growling, heard the snap of those long teeth, the tearing of flesh, shrieks of fear and pain from man and horse alike. Was there only one wolf? It was hard to be certain.

The wolf’s head on his shield was slashed half to pieces, raw wood showing where deep gouges had been hacked in the oak, but Robb himself seemed unhurt. Yet when he came closer, Catelyn saw that his mailed glove and the sleeve of his surcoat were black with blood. "You’re hurt," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5900" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏归来时，骑的已不是原本那匹灰马，而是一匹花斑马。他盾牌上的狼头几乎被砍成碎片，木板上刻画出深深的痕迹，但本人似乎安然无恙。然而当他走近，凯特琳却发现他的锁甲手套和外衣袖子上全是黑血。“你受伤了。”她说。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5919');"><p>"...I should then be mourning in place of Lord Karstark," Catelyn said. "Your men did what they were sworn to do, Robb. They died protecting their liege lord. Grieve for them. Honor them for their valor. But not now. You have no time for grief. You may have lopped the head off the snake, but three quarters of the body is still coiled around my father’s castle. We have won a battle, not a war."

I vow, the Lannisters lost ten men for every one of ours that fell. We’ve taken close to a hundred knights captive, and a dozen lords bannermen. Lord Westerling, Lord Banefort, Ser Garth Greenfield, Lord Estren, Ser Tytos Brax, Mallor the Dornishman?.?.?.?and three Lannisters besides Jaime, Lord Tywin’s own nephews, two of his sister’s sons and one of his dead brother’s?.?.?.?"
