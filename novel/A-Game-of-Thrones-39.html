</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3476');"><p>You want eat?" Mord asked, glowering. He had a plate of oiled beans in one thick, stub-fingered hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3476" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你想不想吃？”手指粗大的莫德拿着一盘煮豆子，瞪着他问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3477');"><p>Tyrion Lannister was starved, but he refused to let this brute see him cringe. "A leg of lamb would be pleasant," he said, from the heap of soiled straw in the corner of his cell. "Perhaps a dish of peas and onions, some fresh baked bread with butter, and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down. Or beer, if that’s easier. I try not to be overly particular."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3477" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂•兰尼斯特虽然饥肠辘辘，却不愿让这粗汉享受到虐待的快感。“有根羊腿一定很棒，”他坐在牢房角落脏兮兮的稻草堆上说，“或许再来一碟青豆和洋葱，上点刚出炉的奶油面包，再配一壶温过的葡萄酒把食物冲下肚。如果不方便的话，啤酒也行，我这个人向来不太挑剔。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3478');"><p>"Is beans," Mord said. "Here." He held out the plate.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3478" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“只有豆子。”莫德说：“拿去。”他递出盘子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3479');"><p>Tyrion sighed. The turnkey was twenty stone of gross stupidity, with brown rotting teeth and small dark eyes. The left side of his face was slick with scar where an axe had cut off his ear and part of his cheek. He was as predictable as he was ugly, but Tyrion was hungry. He reached up for the plate.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3479" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂叹口气。这名狱卒既肥又笨，满口褐色烂牙，细小的深色眼睛。他左半边脸都是伤疤，那是之前被斧头削去耳朵和部分脸颊所留下的痕迹。虽然他愚蠢又丑陋，但提利昴肚子真是饿了。他伸手去拿盘子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3480');"><p>Mord jerked it away, grinning. "Is here," he said, holding it out beyond Tyrion’s reach.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3480" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫德嘻嘻笑着挪开盘子。“在这儿。”他说，一边把盘子举到提利昂够不着的地方。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3481');"><p>The dwarf climbed stiffly to his feet, every joint aching. "Must we play the same fool’s game with every meal?" He made another grab for the beans.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3481" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>侏儒僵硬地爬起身，每个关节都在叫痛。“我们每次吃饭都得玩这笨游戏吗？”他又伸手去拿。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3482');"><p>Mord shambled backward, grinning through his rotten teeth. "Is here, dwarf man." He held the plate out at arm’s length, over the edge where the cell ended and the sky began. "You not want eat? Here. Come take."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3482" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫德蹒跚着后退，露出烂牙嘻笑道：“小矮人，在这儿。”他伸直了手，把盘子放到牢房尽头的半空上。“你不想吃？在这，来拿啊。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3483');"><p>Tyrion’s arms were too short to reach the plate, and he was not about to step that close to the edge. All it would take would be a quick shove of Mord’s heavy white belly, and he would end up a sickening red splotch on the stones of Sky, like so many other prisoners of the Eyrie over the centuries. "Come to think on it, I’m not hungry after all," he declared, retreating to the corner of his cell.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3483" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂的手臂太短，够不到盘子，更何况他不打算靠近牢房边缘。莫德只需用他白白的大肚子一推，他就会变成长天堡岩顶上的一瘫恶心红渍，像几世纪以来鹰巢城的许多犯人一样。“仔细想想，我并不太饿哩。”他宣布，又退回监狱的角落。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3484');"><p>Mord grunted and opened his thick fingers. The wind took the plate, flipping it over as it fell. A handful of beans sprayed back at them as the food tumbled out of sight. The turnkey laughed, his gut shaking like a bowl of pudding.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3484" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫德咕哝着松开他肥胖的手指。强风吹走盘子，坠落的途中不断翻滚。食物飞出视线，还有几颗豆子被吹回来。狱卒哈哈大笑，肚子像一碗布丁似地摇晃。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3485');"><p>Tyrion felt a pang of rage. "You fucking son of a pox-ridden ass," he spat. "I hope you die of a bloody flux."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3485" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂只觉怒火中烧。“你这操他妈狗娘养的烂货，”他啐道，“祝你早日七孔流血而死。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3486');"><p>For that, Mord gave him a kick, driving a steel-toed boot hard into Tyrion’s ribs on the way out. "I take it back!" he gasped as he doubled over on the straw. "I’ll kill you myself, I swear it!" The heavy iron-bound door slammed shut. Tyrion heard the rattle of keys.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3486" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>因为他这番话，莫德出去的时候，狠狠踢了他一脚，钢靴正中提利昂的肋骨。 “我收回刚说的话！”他倒在稻草堆上，喘着气说，“我要亲自宰了你，我发誓！”厚重的铁门轰地关上，提利昂听见钥匙转动的声音。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3487');"><p>For a small man, he had been cursed with a dangerously big mouth, he reflected as he crawled back to his corner of what the Arryns laughably called their dungeon. He huddled beneath the thin blanket that was his only bedding, staring out at a blaze of empty blue sky and distant mountains that seemed to go on forever, wishing he still had the shadowskin cloak he’d won from Marillion at dice, after the singer had stolen it off the body of that brigand chief. The skin had smelled of blood and mold, but it was warm and thick. Mord had taken it the moment he laid eyes on it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3487" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>对他这样的小个子而言，他很不幸地生了张非常危险的大嘴巴，他一边爬回角落一边想，艾林家的人竟把这称为他们的“地牢”，真叫人哭笑不得。他蜷缩在薄薄的毡子下——那是他惟一的被褥——向外望着那片刺眼的空虚蓝天，以及好似漫无边际的缥缈峰峦，暗想着如果还保有那件影子山猫皮披风，不知该有多好。披风是马瑞里安从山贼头目的尸首上扒去的，后来歌手和他赌骰子输了，便落入他手中。山猫皮虽然散发着霉味和血腥，却很温暖厚实。可惜莫德一看到便把它抢走了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3488');"><p>The wind tugged at his blanket with gusts sharp as talons. His cell was miserably small, even for a dwarf. Not five feet away, where a wall ought to have been, where a wall would be in a proper dungeon, the floor ended and the sky began. He had plenty of fresh air and sunshine, and the moon and stars by night, but Tyrion would have traded it all in an instant for the dankest, gloomiest pit in the bowels of the Casterly Rock.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3488" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>尖如利爪的劲风扯着他的毛毯。即使对他这个侏儒来说，牢房也嫌太小。倘若这里真是“地牢”，那么不到五英尺外，原本应该有墙。相反，那里却是地板尽头和天空的交界。虽然这里白天空气新鲜，阳光耀眼，夜里也有繁星与明月，提利昂却宁可拿凯岩城底部最阴暗潮湿的坑洞来交换。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3489');"><p>"You fly," Mord had promised him, when he’d shoved him into the cell. "Twenty day, thirty, fifty maybe. Then you fly."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3489" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你飞，”之前莫德一把推他进来时，曾向他保证。“经过二十天，三十天，最多五十天，你就会飞。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3490');"><p>The Arryns kept the only dungeon in the realm where the prisoners were welcome to escape at will. That first day, after girding up his courage for hours, Tyrion had lain flat on his stomach and squirmed to the edge, to poke out his head and look down. Sky was six hundred feet below, with nothing between but empty air. If he craned his neck out as far as it could go, he could see other cells to his right and left and above him. He was a bee in a stone honeycomb, and someone had torn off his wings.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3490" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>放眼七国全境，只有艾林家族的地牢鼓励犯人逃脱。进来的第一天，提利昂花了好几个小时，才鼓起勇气趴在地上，慢慢爬到山崖边，探出头往下望。正下方六百英尺，坐落着长天堡，与他的囚室之间除了空气，什么也没有。如果他伸长脖子，可以看到在他左右两方的其他牢房。他是石头蜂窝里的一只蜜蜂，还被人折了翅膀。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3491');"><p>It was cold in the cell, the wind screamed night and day, and worst of all, the floor sloped. Ever so slightly, yet it was enough. He was afraid to close his eyes, afraid that he might roll over in his steep and wake in sudden terror as he went sliding off the edge. Small wonder the sky cells drove men mad.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3491" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>囚室极冷，山风日夜呼啸，最糟的是地板竟然向外倾斜。虽然幅度不大，但也够他受了。他不敢闭眼，害怕沉睡时会滚落悬崖，然后惊恐地在半空中醒来。难怪天牢会把人逼疯。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3492');"><p>Gods save me, some previous tenant had written on the wall in something that looked suspiciously like blood, the blue is calling. At first Tyrion wondered who he’d been, and what had become of him; later, he decided that he would rather not know.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3492" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>诸神救救我，某个之前住在这里的囚犯，用疑似血液的东西在地上涂写了如是的文字，蓝天呼唤着我。起先提利昂还猜测这人是谁，以及他下场如何；后来再想想，觉得自己还是别知道的好。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3493');"><p>If only he had shut his mouth?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_3493" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>要是他闭上嘴巴就好了…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3494');"><p>The wretched boy had started it, looking down on him from a throne of carved weirwood beneath the moon-and-falcon banners of House Arryn. Tyrion Lannister had been looked down on all his life, but seldom by rheumy-eyed six-year-olds who needed to stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift them to the height of a man. "Is he the bad man?" the boy had asked, clutching his doll.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3494" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一切都是从那高高坐在鱼梁木雕刻的王座上，头顶飘扬着艾林家族的新月猎鹰旗臶，睥睨着他的该死小鬼开始的。提利昂这辈子经常被人轻贱，然而被眼睛湿黏黏，得坐在厚厚的垫子上才有正常人高度的六岁小鬼如此看待，还是头一遭。“他就是那个坏人吗？”小鬼抱着玩偶问。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3495');"><p>"He is," the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him. She was all in blue, powdered and perfumed for the suitors who filled her court.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3495" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就是他。”莱莎夫人坐在他旁边一张较小的王座上，一袭蓝衣，为了满足追求者，特别扑了粉又喷了香水。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3496');"><p>"He’s so small," the Lord of the Eyrie said, giggling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3496" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他好小一点点呀。”鹰巢城公爵咯咯笑着说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3497');"><p>"This is Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister, who murdered your father." She raised her voice so it carried down the length of High Hall of the Eyrie, ringing off the milk-white walls and the slender pillars, so every man could hear it. "He slew the Hand of the King!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3497" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是兰尼斯特家的小恶魔提利昂，谋害你父亲的就是他。”她提高音量，所讲的话传辫整个鹰巢城大厅，在乳白色墙壁和纤细的柱子间回荡，让每个人都听得到。“他害死了国王的首相！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3498');"><p>"Oh, did I kill him too?" Tyrion had said, like a fool.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3498" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哦，原来他也是我杀的？”提利昂像个蠢蛋似地反问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3499');"><p>That would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his head bowed. He could see that now; seven hells, he had seen it then. The High Hall of the Arryns was long and austere, with a forbidding coldness to its walls of blue-veined white marble, but the faces around him had been colder by far. The power of Casterly Rock was far away, and there were no friends of the Lannisters in the Vale of Arryn. Submission and silence would have been his best defenses.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3499" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那个时候，他本应当低下头颅，乖乖闭紧嘴巴。他早该想到的，七层地狱，其实他当时又何尝不知。艾林家的议事厅堂硕长而俭朴，蓝纹的白色大理石墙，有股令人难以亲近的寒意，然而周遭众人的脸色，才真叫人心寒。此处凯岩城势力鞭长莫及，艾林谷中也少有亲兰尼斯特人士。总的说来，态度屈从，保持沉默，实是他最佳防御。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3500');"><p>But Tyrion’s mood had been too foul for sense. To his shame, he had faltered during the last leg of their day-long climb up to the Eyrie, his stunted legs unable to take him any higher. Bronn had carried him the rest of the way, and the humiliation poured oil on the flames of his anger. "It would seem I’ve been a busy little fellow," he said with bitter sarcasm. "I wonder when I found the time to do all this slaying and murdering."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3500" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而那时提利昂心情正恶，哪还顾得了理臹。在上鹰巢城长达一整天的攀爬之行最后，他发育缺陷的双腿实在无法行走，只好很丢脸地让波隆背他上山。此刻所受的羞辱，无疑对他本已炽烈的怒意火上添油。“看来我还真是个忙碌的小家伙，”他口气酸苦地讥讽道，“连自己都不知道哪来的时间杀这杀那。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3501');"><p>He ought to have remembered who he was dealing with. Lysa Arryn and her half-sane weakling son had not been known at court for their love of wit, especially when it was directed at them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3501" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他早该想起自己面对的是谁。莱莎•艾林和她那半疯的虚弱小鬼对耍弄机臹向无好感，尤其是针对他们的时候，这在宫里是人尽皆知的事。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3502');"><p>"Imp," Lysa said coldly, "you will guard that mocking tongue of yours and speak to my son politely, or I promise you will have cause to regret it. Remember where you are. This is the Eyrie, and these are knights of the Vale you see around you, true men who loved Jon Arryn well. Every one of them would die for me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3502" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小恶魔，”莱莎冷冷地说，“你最好管紧你那张碎嘴，对我儿子客气点，否则保证你后悔。不要忘记自己身在何处，这里是鹰巢城，你周围的人都是艾林谷的骑士，个个忠贞不贰，对琼恩•艾林敬爱有加，他们每个人都愿意为我牺牲性命。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3503');"><p>"Lady Arryn, should any harm come to me, my brother Jaime will be pleased to see that they do." Even as he spat out the words, Tyrion knew they were folly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3503" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“艾林夫人，我要有什么不测，我老哥詹姆绝对很乐意料理他们。”话出口的刹那，提利昂发觉这么说实在愚蠢。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3504');"><p>"Can you fly, my lord of Lannister?" Lady Lysa asked. "Does a dwarf have wings? If not, you would be wiser to swallow the next threat that comes to mind."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3504" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“兰尼斯特大人，敢问您会飞吗？”莱莎夫人间，“侏儒有没有长翅膀啊？如果没有，您最好乖乖地把其他威胁都吞下肚去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3505');"><p>"I made no threats," Tyrion said. "That was a promise."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3505" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我这不是威胁，”提利昂道，“而是保证。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3506');"><p>Little Lord Robert hopped to his feet at that, so upset he dropped his doll. "You can’t hurt us," he screamed. "No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mother, tell him he can’t hurt us here." The boy began to twitch.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3506" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一听这话，小劳勃公爵跳将起来，气得连玩偶都丢了。“你不能对我们怎样，”他尖叫，“没有人敢在这里乱来。妈咪，你告诉他，跟他说谁也别想来这里撒野。”小男孩开始浑身痉挛。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3507');"><p>"The Eyrie is impregnable," Lysa Arryn declared calmly. She drew her son close, holding him safe in the circle of her plump white arms. "The Imp is trying to frighten us, sweet baby. The Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my sweet boy."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3507" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有人能攻破鹰巢城。”莱莎•艾林冷静地宣布。她把儿子拉过去，用她丰满白皙的臂膀抱住他。“小宝贝，小恶魔只是虚张声势，兰尼斯特家的人通通是骗子。谁也别想欺负我的小亲亲。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3508');"><p>The hell of it was, she was no doubt right. Having seen what it took to get here, Tyrion could well imagine how it would be for a knight trying to fight his way up in armor, while stones and arrows poured down from above and enemies contested with him for every step. Nightmare did not begin to describe it. Small wonder the Eyrie had never been taken.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3508" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她虽然可恶，但说得的确没错。亲眼目睹这里的险要地势之后，提利昂可以想像叫全副武装的骑士，冒着从山上倾注而下的落石箭雨，每走一步阶梯还得对付迎面而来的敌人，会是件多么困难的事。说那是场梦魇，恐怕还不足以形容，难怪鹰巢城自古以来从未陷落。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3509');"><p>Still, Tyrion had been unable to silence himself. "Not impregnable," he said, "merely inconvenient."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3509" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>即使这样，提利昂的舌头还是停不下来。“不是攻不破，”他说，“而是不太好攻破。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3510');"><p>Young Robert pointed down, his hand trembling. "You’re a liar. Mother, I want to see him fly." Two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks seized Tyrion by the arms, lifting him off his floor.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3510" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小劳勃伸出颤抖的手指着他：“你是个骗子。妈咪，我想看他飞。”两个穿天蓝色披风的卫士抓住提利昂双手，把他架离地面。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3511');"><p>The gods only know what might have happened then were it not for Catelyn Stark. "Sister," she called out from where she stood below the thrones, "I beg you to remember, this man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3511" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>若不是凯特琳•史塔克，恐怕只有天上诸神才知道接下来会发生什么。“妹妹，”她站在王座下方，朝莱莎喊，“请你记得，他是我的犯人，请不要伤害他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3512');"><p>Lysa Arryn glanced at her sister coolly for a moment, then rose and swept down on Tyrion, her long skirts trailing after her. For an instant he feared she would strike him, but instead she commanded them to release him. Her men shoved him to the floor, his legs went out from under him, and Tyrion fell.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3512" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱莎•艾林冷冷地看了她姐姐一会儿，然后起身走向提利昂，她的长裙拖在身后。他原本怕她会动手打人，但她却下令放开他。两个卫士把提利昂丢到地上，他双脚扑空，摔倒在地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3513');"><p>He must have made quite a sight as he struggled to his knees, only to feel his right leg spasm, sending him sprawling once more. Laughter boomed up and down the High Hall of the Arryns.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3513" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他出丑的模样想必难看得很；不料他正挣扎着要站起来，右脚竟然抽筋，结果再度瘫在地上。艾林家的大厅里响起哄堂大笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3514');"><p>"My sister’s little guest is too weary to stand," Lady Lysa announced. "Ser Vardis, take him down to the dungeon. A rest in one of our sky cells will do him much good."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3514" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我姐姐的小客人累了，连站都站不稳。”莱莎夫人宣布，“瓦狄斯爵士，麻烦你带他到地牢去。在天上休息休息，想必对他的健康大有助益。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3515');"><p>The guardsmen jerked him upright. Tyrion Lannister dangled between them, kicking feebly, his face red with shame. "I will remember this," he told them all as they carried him off.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3515" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卫兵猛地把他拉起。提利昂•兰尼斯特在两人中间双脚悬空，虚弱地踢打，羞得满脸通红。 “咱们走着瞧。”被架走前，他对全厅的人说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3516');"><p>And so he did, for all the good it did him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3516" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>到目前为止，他还瞧不出有什么解决办法。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3517');"><p>At first he had consoled himself that this imprisonment could not last long. Lysa Arryn wanted to humble him, that was all. She would send for him again, and soon. If not her, then Catelyn Stark would want to question him. This time he would guard his tongue more closely. They dare not kill him out of hand; he was still a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and if they shed his blood, it would mean war. Or so he had told himself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3517" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>起先他安慰自己，认为监禁不会太久。莱莎•艾林不过是想羞辱他。她一定会很快再传他过去。就算她没有，凯特琳•史塔克也会来盘问他。这次他会小心措辞、不乱说话。他们不可能现在就杀他，再怎么说，他都是凯岩城的兰尼斯特家人，他们若敢杀他，便意味着开战。至少，他是这么告诉自己。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3518');"><p>Now he was not so certain.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3518" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而现在他却不那么确定了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3519');"><p>Perhaps his captors only meant to let him rot here, but he feared he did not have the strength to rot for long. He was growing weaker every day, and it was only a matter of time until Mord’s kicks and blows did him serious harm, provided the gaoler did not starve him to death first. A few more nights of cold and hunger, and the blue would start calling to him too.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3519" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>或许他们只打算让他烂在这里，怕只怕自己连烂久点的力气都没有。他日渐虚弱，距离莫德把他踢成重伤，只是时间的问题。这还得以狱卒没先把他饿死为前提。再来几个饥寒交迫的夜晚，蓝天就会呼唤他了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3520');"><p>He wondered what was happening beyond the walls (such as they were) of his cell. Lord Tywin would surely have sent out riders when the word reached him. Jaime might be leading a host through the Mountains of the Moon even now?.?.?.?unless he was riding north against Winterfell instead. Did anyone outside the Vale even suspect where Catelyn Stark had taken him? He wondered what Cersei would do when she heard.

He was highborn, the son of the most powerful lord in the realm, the brother of the queen. He could not be denied a trial. Guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks had started toward Tyrion, but Ser Vardis bid them halt and looked to Lady Lysa.

"If you are tried and found to be guilty of the crimes for which you stand accused, then by the king’s own laws, you must pay with your life’s blood.

Those standing closest edged backward as a pair of guardsmen marched through. One man removed the heavy bronze bars; the second pulled the door inward. Their blue cloaks rose snapping from their shoulders, caught in the sudden gust of wind that came howling through the open door. Beyond was the emptiness of the night sky, speckled with cold uncaring stars.

Lord Nestor Royce snorted, Ser Willis chuckled, Ser Lyn Corbray guffawed, and others threw back their heads and howled until tears ran down their faces.
