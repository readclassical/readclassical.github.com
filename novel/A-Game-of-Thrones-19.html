</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1480');"><p>18．CATELYN
</p></origin><translate id="div_1480" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一个小时之内，咱们便到君临啦！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1481');"><p>We will make King’s Landing within the hour."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1481" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳从桅栏处转过头，强作欢颜道：“船长先生，您的水手表现得非常称职，我要给他们每人一枚银鹿，以表达我的感激。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1482');"><p>Catelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile. "Your oarmen have done well by us, Captain. Each one of them shall have a silver stag, as a token of my gratitude."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1482" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫里欧•图密提斯船长半鞠躬答谢道：“史塔克夫人，您实在是太慷慨了。有幸为您这样的官家夫人服务，就是最好的报酬。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1483');"><p>Captain Moreo Turnitis favored her with a half bow. "You are far too generous, Lady Stark. The honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1483" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我总是要给他们的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1484');"><p>"But they’ll take the silver anyway."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1484" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫里欧微笑：“那就恭敬不如从命。”他的通用语讲得十分流利，只带极轻微的泰洛西口音。他在狭海上讨生活已足足有三十年，据他所说，他最初只是个划桨的水手，继而当上大副，最后才终于有了自己的商船队。双桅帆船“暴风舞者号”是他的第四艘船，共有六十条桨、两根桅杆，也是他最快的一艘。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1485');"><p>Moreo smiled. "As you say." He spoke the Common Tongue fluently, with only the slightest hint of a Tyroshi accent. He’d been plying the narrow sea for thirty years, he’d told her, as oarman, quartermaster, and finally captain of his own trading galleys. The Storm Dancer was his fourth ship, and his fastest, a two-masted galley of sixty oars.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1485" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>至少当凯特琳和罗德利克•凯索爵士马不停蹄地顺流奔波，抵达白港的时候，她是港湾里最快的一艘。泰洛西人的贪婪恶名远播，罗德利克爵士原本主张雇艘无桨单桅渔船出三姐妹群岛，然而凯特琳坚持要这艘大帆船。这是个明臹的选择。一路上，风向都与他们作对，倘若没有这些划桨好手，恐怕他们现在还在五指半岛挣扎，遑论驶向旅程的终点君临了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1486');"><p>She had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in White Harbor when Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver. The Tyroshi were notorious for their avarice, and Ser Rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the Three Sisters, but Catelyn had insisted on the galley. It was good that she had. The winds had been against them much of the voyage, and without the galley’s oars they’d still be beating their way past the Fingers, instead of skimming toward King’s Landing and journey’s end.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1486" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就快到了啊，她心想。包扎在棉布绷带中的手指上，被匕首割伤的地方仍在隐隐作痛，凯特琳觉得，痛楚是在提醒她别忘记发生过的事。她左手的小指和无名指没法弯曲，而其他三根手指也永远不可能恢复灵活动作。然而，若能换得布兰性命，这算得了什么？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1487');"><p>So close, she thought. Beneath the linen bandages, her fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten. The pain was her scourge, Catelyn felt, lest she forget. She could not bend the last two fingers on her left hand, and the others would never again be dexterous. Yet that was a small enough price to pay for Bran’s life.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1487" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时罗德利克爵士走上甲板。“我的好朋友啊，”一脸分岔绿胡子的莫里欧说。泰洛西人热爱各种鲜明色彩，连他们的胡须睫毛都不放过。“看到你气色好多了，真替你高兴。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1488');"><p>Ser Rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck. "My good friend," said Moreo through his forked green beard. The Tyroshi loved bright colors, even in their facial hair. "It is so fine to see you looking better."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1488" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哦，”罗德利克附和。“这两天我的确舒服了点，不会那么想寻短见了。”说完他向凯特琳鞠躬。“夫人您好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1489');"><p>"Yes," Ser Rodrik agreed. "I haven’t wanted to die for almost two days now." He bowed to Catelyn. "My lady."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1489" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的气色真的好多了，虽然比起他们自白港启程时，整个人瘦了一小圈，但差不多恢复了原有的神采。他适应不了咬人湾的劲风和狭海的猛浪，行经龙石岛时暴风骤临，他还差点落海，总算是死命抓住一根缆绳，三名莫里欧手下的水手才把他安然救回船舱。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1490');"><p>He was looking better. A shade thinner than he had been when they set out from White Harbor, but almost himself again. The strong winds in the Bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed with him, and he’d almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off Dragonstone, yet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of Moreo’s men could rescue him and carry him safely below decks.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1490" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“船长刚才说，我们的旅程快结束了。”她说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1491');"><p>"The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1491" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗德利克爵士勉强挤出一丝笑容。“这么快？”少了雪白的鬓角和胡须，他看起来有些不对劲，仿佛突然间老了十岁，个头变小，往日的威猛也不复见。这是没办法的事，途经啮咬湾时，他趴在桅栏边朝狂风中吐个不休，到得第三次，胡子已经脏得无可救药，只好乖乖让水手用剃刀把胡子理干净。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1492');"><p>Ser Rodrik managed a wry smile. "So soon?" He looked odd without his great white side whiskers; smaller somehow, less fierce, and ten years older. Yet back on the Bite it had seemed prudent to submit to a crewman’s razor, after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he leaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1492" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们谈正事，我不打扰了。”莫里欧说完鞠躬离去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1493');"><p>"I will leave you to discuss your business," Captain Moreo said. He bowed and took his leave of them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1493" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>帆船像蜻蜓般在水面漂浮，桨叶整齐划一地起起落落。罗德利克爵士拉住栏杆，朝飞驰的陆地远眺。“我实在不是个称职的护卫。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1494');"><p>The galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly, her oars rising and falling in perfect time. Ser Rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore. "I have not been the most valiant of protectors."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1494" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳拍拍他的臂膀，“罗德利克爵士，我们安然抵达了目的地，这样就够了。”她的另一只手在斗篷底下摸索，指头僵硬而笨拙。匕首依然在腰际，她发现自己必须不时碰触它才能安心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1495');"><p>Catelyn touched his arm. "We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely. That is all that truly matters." Her hand groped beneath her cloak, her fingers stiff and fumbling. The dagger was still at her side. She found she had to touch it now and then, to reassure herself. "Now we must reach the king’s master-at-arms, and pray that he can be trusted."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1495" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“接下来我们便去找国王的教头，诸神保佑，希望他值得信赖。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1496');"><p>"Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man, but an honest one." Ser Rodrik’s hand went to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone. He looked nonplussed. "He may know the blade, yes?.?.?.?but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are at risk. And there are those at court who will know you on sight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1496" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“艾伦•桑塔加爵士人虽然虚荣了点，却非常正直。”罗德利克爵士伸手欲捻胡须，却扑了个空。他有些不知所措地说：“他很可能认得出那把刀…….可是夫人，上岸之后，我们便有暴露身份的危险，更何况宫中有人一眼就可认出您。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1497');"><p>Catelyn’s mouth grew tight. "Littlefinger," she murmured. His face swam up before her; a boy’s face, though he was a boy no longer. His father had died several years before, so he was Lord Baelish now, yet still they called him Littlefinger. Her brother Edmure had given him that name, long ago at Riverrun. His family’s modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and short for his age.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1497" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳抿紧嘴唇。“小指头，”她喃喃道。他的脸浮现在她眼前，一张男孩子的脸，然而他早已不是个孩子了。他的父亲几年前刚过世，如今他是贝里席伯爵，但大家仍唤他作小指头。这绰号是她弟弟艾德慕很久以前在奔流城帮他取的，起因是他家族封地狭小，且位于五指半岛中最小的半岛上，而培提尔在同龄孩子间又特别瘦小的缘故。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1498');"><p>Ser Rodrik cleared his throat. "Lord Baelish once, ah?.?.?.?" His thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1498" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗德利克爵士清清喉咙。“贝里席大人以前是，呃……”他结结巴巴，试图找出比较礼貌的用词。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1499');"><p>Catelyn was past delicacy. "He was my father’s ward. We grew up together in Riverrun. I thought of him as a brother, but his feelings for me were?.?.?.?more than brotherly. When it was announced that I was to wed Brandon Stark, Petyr challenged for the right to my hand. It was madness. Brandon was twenty, Petyr scarcely fifteen. I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr’s life. He let him off with a scar. Afterward my father sent him away. I have not seen him since." She lifted her face to the spray, as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away. "He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread. By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother’s place."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1499" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳顾不得什么称谓。“他是我父亲的养子，我们在奔流城一起长大。我视他为兄弟，但他却……不只把我当成姐妹。当我和布兰登•史塔克将要成亲的消息宣布时，他要求决斗，胜者才能娶我为妻。那根本就是疯狂之举，布兰登当时已经二十岁，培提尔才不过十五。我求布兰登放他一马，结果他只在他身上留了个疤。事后我父亲把他送走，我至今没和他再见面。”她抬脸面向浪花，仿佛轻快的海风可以吹走回忆。“布兰登死后，他寄信到奔流城给我，但我没拆就通通烧掉。因为那时候，我已经知道奈德会代替他哥哥娶我为妻。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1500');"><p>Ser Rodrik’s fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers. "Littlefinger sits on the small council now."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1500" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗德利克爵士伸手想摸胡子，又扑了个空。“小指头如今是御前会议的成员。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1501');"><p>"I knew he would rise high," Catelyn said. "He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise. I wonder what the years have done to him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1501" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我早知道他会大有发展。”凯特琳说，“他打小就很机灵。可机灵和睿臹是两回事，真不知道这些年他有多大改变。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1502');"><p>High overhead, the far-eyes sang out from the rigging. Captain Moreo came scrambling across the deck, giving orders, and all around them the Storm Dancer burst into frenetic activity as King’s Landing slid into view atop its three high hills.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1502" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>头顶的了望员从绳索上高声呼喝，莫里欧船长在甲板上来回走动下达命令，随着位于三座丘陵之上的都城君临映入眼帘，整个“暴风舞者号”立刻陷入一片忙乱的活动中。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1503');"><p>Three hundred years ago, Catelyn knew, those heights had been covered with forest, and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the Blackwater Rush where that deep, swift river flowed into the sea. Then Aegon the Conqueror had sailed from Dragonstone. It was here that his army had put ashore, and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1503" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳知道三百年前这片高地完全被森林覆盖，只有零星的渔夫在水流湍急、深涌入海的黑水河北岸定居。后来征服者伊耿自龙石岛渡海而来，他的军队便是在此处登陆，随后他在最高的丘陵顶端用木材和泥土筑起了他第一座粗糙的防御堡垒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1504');"><p>Now the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see; manses and arbors and granaries, brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchant’s stalls, taverns and graveyards and brothels, all piled one on another. She could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance. Between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees, wandering crookback streets, and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast. Visenya’s hill was crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its seven crystal towers. Across the city on the hill of Rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit, its huge dome collapsing into ruin, its bronze doors closed now for a century. The Street of the Sisters ran between them, straight as an arrow. The city walls rose in the distance, high and strong.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1504" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>而今凯特琳视线所及，皆已成为繁华城区，豪宅、凉亭、谷仓、砖砌仓库、木屋旅店和市集摊位，酒馆、墓园和妓院，一座接着一座。即使距离尚远，她仍可听见渔市里的喧闹。宽阔的林荫大道，蜿蜒的曲折小街，还有窄得无法容纳两人并肩通行的巷弄穿梭在建筑物之间。圣贝勒大教堂的大理石墙环绕着维桑尼亚丘陵顶，七座水晶塔楼耸立其中。彼端的雷妮丝丘陵上，坐落着龙穴焦黑的残垣断壁，倒塌的巨大圆顶废墟，紧闭一世纪之久的青铜大门。两丘之间，静默姐妹街笔直如箭，坚实的围城高墙则环绕在外。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1505');"><p>A hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. Deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and forth across the Blackwater Rush, trading galleys unloaded goods from Braavos and Pentos and Lys. Catelyn spied the queen’s ornate barge, tied up beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben, its hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in their cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1505" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>百余座码头罗列水滨，港口里停泊着无数船只。深水渔船和河流渡筏络绎不绝，船夫撑篙往来于黑水湾，商船则源源不断卸下来自布拉佛斯、潘托斯和里斯的货物。凯特琳瞥见王后装饰华丽的游艇，停泊在一艘吃水颇深、船身涂满黑色焦油、从伊班港来的捕鲸船旁边。上游处有十来艘狭长的黄金战船，船帆卷起，铁臸撞锤轻轻拍打水面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1506');"><p>And above it all, frowning down from Aegon’s high hill, was the Red Keep; seven huge drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts, an immense grim barbican, vaulted halls and covered bridges, barracks and dungeons and granaries, massive curtain walls studded with archers’ nests, all fashioned of pale red stone. Aegon the Conqueror had commanded it built. His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it completed. Afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on it. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, he vowed. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1506" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>睥睨这一切的是伊耿丘陵上的红堡。它包括七栋加固钢铁工事的巨大鼓塔，一座硕大无比而冷酷的堡楼，圆顶大厅与密闭桥梁、军营、地牢和谷仓，以及开满箭口的厚重护墙，全是浅红色石头砌成。征服者伊耿当年下令建造这座城堡，他的儿子“残酷梅葛”将之完成。竣工以后，他将每位参与筑城的石匠、木工和建筑师全部斩首，誓言惟有真龙传人方能掌握龙王堡垒的秘密。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1507');"><p>Yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, and where the three-headed dragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1507" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>不想如今，飘扬在城墙上的旗臶却是金黄而非墨黑，三头龙曾经怒吐烈焰的地方，成了拜拉席恩家族的宝冠雄鹿奔驰昂扬的疆域。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1508');"><p>A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port, its white sails huge with wind. The Storm Dancer moved past it, pulling steadily for shore.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1508" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一艘来自盛夏群岛的高桅天鹅船，正乘风张满白帆，驶离港口。暴风舞者号从她身边驶过，稳稳地准备靠岸。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1509');"><p>"My lady," Ser Rodrik said, "I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed. You must not enter the castle. I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1509" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，”罗德利克爵士说，“我趁躺在床上休养这段时间，仔细考虑过下一步该如何行动。首先，您绝对不能进城，由我一个人去把艾伦带到安全的地方见您就好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1510');"><p>She studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier. Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyrian of the Free Cities. "You would be as much at risk as I would."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1510" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>帆船驶近码头，她仔细端详着老骑士。莫里欧正用自由贸易城邦粗野的瓦雷利亚方言大声喝令。“你冒的风险不比我少。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1511');"><p>Ser Rodrik smiled. "I think not. I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself. My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead. I believe I am safe enough, my lady."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1511" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗德利克爵士微笑道：“我看不然。早些时候我朝水里的倒影瞧了瞧，差点认不出自己。我母亲是这世上最后一个见过我没留胡子模样的人，而她已经过世了四十年。夫人，我相信我一定安全。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1512');"><p>Moreo bellowed a command. As one, sixty oars lifted from the river, then reversed and backed water. The galley slowed. Another shout. The oars slid back inside the hull. As they thumped against the dock, Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up. Moreo came bustling up, all smiles. "King’s Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage. Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1512" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫里欧大声吆喝，六十支桨整齐划一地自水中拉起，然后朝反方向划去。船速减缓，又是一声大喝，桨叶便都缩回船壳里面。船靠码头之后，泰洛西水手立即跳下船拴住缆绳。莫里欧满脸堆笑地跑过来。“夫人，照您吩咐，咱们抵达君临了，我敢打赌从没有一艘船能这么迅速、这么平顺地抵达目辬。您可需要派人帮忙把行李搬去城堡？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1513');"><p>"We shall not be going to the castle. Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1513" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们不去城堡，你倒是可以推荐几家干净舒适的旅馆，离河不要太远。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1514');"><p>The Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard. "Just so. I know of several establishments that might suit your needs. Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon. And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise. Sixty stags, I believe it was."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1514" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>泰洛西船长捻捻绿色的八字胡，“那敢情好，我倒是知道几个符合您要求的店家。不过首先嘛，恕我无礼，咱们约定的旅费还剩一半没付清呢。还有您慷慨答应的额外小费，如果我没记错的话，好像是六十枚银币。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1515');"><p>"For the oarmen," Catelyn reminded him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1515" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那是给船员的。”凯特琳提醒他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1516');"><p>"Oh, of a certainty," said Moreo. "Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh. For the sake of their wives and children. If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a night’s pleasure."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1516" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“噢，那当然，”莫里欧道，“不过还是我先帮他们保管，等咱们回到泰洛西再分配好了。这可是为他们妻小着想啊，想想看，若是现在就给他们，夫人，他们肯定会赌个精光或拿去买一夜之欢呀。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1517');"><p>"There are worse things to spend money on," Ser Rodrik put in. "Winter is coming."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1517" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“花花钱也无可厚非，”罗德利克爵士插话，“因为凛冬将至。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1518');"><p>"A man must make his own choices," Catelyn said. "They earned the silver. How they spend it is no concern of mine."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1518" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“人应该为自己的行为负责。”凯特琳说，“这是他们辛苦挣来的血汗钱，怎么花我无足置喙。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1519');"><p>"As you say, my lady," Moreo replied, bowing and smiling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1519" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那就照您吩咐，夫人。”莫里欧一边打躬作揖一边笑着回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1520');"><p>Just to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen herself, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up Visenya’s hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested. It was a rambling old place on Eel Alley. The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real. Her rooms were large and airy, though, and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms. Best of all, she had no interest in their names.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1520" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>为以防万一，凯特琳把钱当面赏给水手，每人一枚银鹿，至于帮她搬行李的两位海员，则额外多加了两个铜币。他们把东西搬到莫里欧推荐的旅馆，位于维桑尼亚丘陵半腰，据说是鳗鱼巷里的老字号。老板娘是个坏脾气的老妇，先是满腹狐疑地上下打量他们俩，又把凯特琳付的钱币用牙齿咬了又咬，大概在审是不是真的。虽然如此，房间倒是挺宽敞，通风也好，而且莫里欧说她煮的鱼汤七国上下无人能及。最棒的是，她完全不过问客人的名姓。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1521');"><p>"I think it best if you stay away from the common room," Ser Rodrik said, after they had settled in.

Her windows opened on the alley and rooftops, with a view of the Blackwater beyond. She watched Ser Rodrik set off, striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds, then decided to take his advice. The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers, but she had no trouble falling asleep.

Ser Rodrik would never have told him. Old he might be, but he was stubborn, and loyal to a fault. Were they too late, had the Lannisters reached King’s Landing before her?

He had been a sly child, but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite; it was a gift he had. The years had not changed him much. Petyr had been a small boy, and he had grown into a small man, an inch or two shorter than Catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features she remembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. He had a little pointed chin beard now, and threads of silver in his dark hair, though he was still shy of thirty. They went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak. Even as a child, he had always loved his silver.
