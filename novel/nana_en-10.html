</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1978');"><p>Thereupon Nana became a smart woman, mistress of all that is foolish and filthy in man, marquise in the ranks of her calling. It was a sudden but decisive start, a plunge into the garish day of gallant notoriety and mad expenditure and that daredevil wastefulness peculiar to beauty. She at once became queen among the most expensive of her kind. Her photographs were displayed in shopwindows, and she was mentioned in the papers. When she drove in her carriage along the boulevards the people would turn and tell one another who that was with all the unction of a nation saluting its sovereign, while the object of their adoration lolled easily back in her diaphanous dresses and smiled gaily under the rain of little golden curls which ran riot above the blue of her made-up eyes and the red of her painted lips. And the wonder of wonders was that the great creature, who was so awkward on the stage, so very absurd the moment she sought to act the chaste woman, was able without effort to assume the role of an enchantress in the outer world. Her movements were lithe as a serpent's, and the studied and yet seemingly involuntary carelessness with which she dressed was really exquisite in its elegance. There was a nervous distinction in all she did which suggested a wellborn Persian cat; she was an aristocrat in vice and proudly and rebelliously trampled upon a prostrate Paris like a sovereign whom none dare disobey. She set the fashion, and great ladies imitated her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1978" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是娜娜变成了一个时髦女子，一个依靠男性的荒唐和堕落来生活的寄生虫，一个颇具贵妇仪态的高等妓女。她的失足虽是偶然的，却决定了她的终身。她摇身一变成了著名的风流女子，尽人皆知的一掷千金、肆无忌惮地卖弄姿色的女流。她很快在要价最高的妓女中成了王后。她的照片陈列在橱窗里，报纸上常常见到她的名字。每当她乘坐马车经过大街上时，人们都掉过头来看她一眼，呼唤她的名字，激奋之情犹如民众见到王后一般；而她则身着轻飘飘的服装，悠然自得地倚靠在车子上，脸上挂着微笑，十分快乐，金色的细雨般的一缕缕细小鬈发垂挂到涂蓝的眼圈边和搽口红的嘴唇边。说来奇怪，这个胖姑娘在舞台上是那么笨拙，扮演正经女人是那么滑稽可笑，但在街上扮演迷人的女子，却不费吹灰之力。她的身体像水蛇一般柔软自如，衣着得体，看起来是随意穿戴，却显得风度翩翩，像一只矫捷超群的纯种母猫，堪称烟花女中的佼佼者。她很高傲，富有叛逆精神，像一个权力至高无上的统治者，把巴黎踩在脚下。她随意穿上什么款式的服装，贵妇们便纷纷仿效她。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1979');"><p>Nana's fine house was situated at the corner of the Rue Cardinet, in the Avenue de Villiers. The avenue was part of the luxurious quarter at that time springing up in the vague district which had once been the Plaine Monceau. The house had been built by a young painter, who was intoxicated by a first success, and had been perforce resold almost as soon as it was habitable. It was in the palatial Renaissance manner and had fantastic interior arrangements which consisted of modern conveniences framed in a setting of somewhat artificial originality. Count Muffat had bought the house ready furnished and full of hosts of beautiful objects—lovely Eastern hangings, old credences, huge chairs of the Louis XIII epoch. And thus Nana had come into artistic surroundings of the choicest kind and of the most extravagantly various dates. But since the studio, which occupied the central portion of the house, could not be of any use to her, she had upset existing arrangements, establishing a small drawing room on the first floor, next to her bedroom and dressing room, and leaving a conservatory, a large drawing room and a dining room to look after themselves underneath. She astonished the architect with her ideas, for, as became a Parisian workgirl who understands the elegancies of life by instinct, she had suddenly developed a very pretty taste for every species of luxurious refinement. Indeed, she did not spoil her house overmuch; nay, she even added to the richness of the furniture, save here and there, where certain traces of tender foolishness and vulgar magnificence betrayed the ex-flower seller who had been wont to dream in front of shopwindows in the arcades.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1979" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜的公馆在维里埃大街，卡迪内街的拐角处，所处地段是一个豪华地区。这里原来是蒙梭平原，一座座建筑在这空旷的土地上拔地而起。这座公馆当初是由一位青年画家所建，这位画家由于在绘画艺术上初露锋芒，兴奋得飘飘然起来，便建了这座公馆，可是房子刚刚粉刷完毕，又不得不把它卖掉。房子颇具文艺复兴时代的建筑的风貌，外观很像一座宫殿，内部布局别具一格，舒适的起居设备都是现代的，但又具备不落俗套的特色。缪法伯爵买下了这座配备家具的公馆，里面摆了许多小摆设，配上了华美的东方帷幔，古色古香的餐具柜，路易十三时代的大扶手椅；因此，娜娜不期而获得了颇具艺术特色的家具，家具都是经过精心挑选的，富有不同时代特色。不过，占据公馆中央的画室，对她来说毫无用场，于是她就把楼上楼下通通改造一番，在底层设了一间温室、一大间客厅、一间饭厅，在二楼靠近她的卧室和梳妆室的地方，设了一间小客厅。她的设想令建筑师们惊讶不已，她仿佛生来就要过奢侈的生活，作为巴黎街头妓女，追求时髦豪华是她的天性。总之，她并未把公馆搞得不像样子，甚至还使富丽堂皇的家具上增添了一些摆设，仅在某些方面留下雅致得有点可笑、华丽得有点刺目的痕迹，由此可以看出她昔日是个卖花女，曾经在商店的橱窗前构想自己未来生活的蓝图。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1980');"><p>A carpet was spread on the steps beneath the great awning over the front door in the court, and the moment you entered the hall you were greeted by a perfume as of violets and a soft, warm atmosphere which thick hangings helped to produce. A window, whose yellow-and rose-colored panes suggested the warm pallor of human flesh, gave light to the wide staircase, at the foot of which a Negro in carved wood held out a silver tray full of visiting cards and four white marble women, with bosoms displayed, raised lamps in their uplifted hands. Bronzes and Chinese vases full of flowers, divans covered with old Persian rugs, armchairs upholstered in old tapestry, furnished the entrance hall, adorned the stairheads and gave the first-floor landing the appearance of an anteroom. Here men's overcoats and hats were always in evidence, and there were thick hangings which deadened every sound. It seemed a place apart: on entering it you might have fancied yourself in a chapel, whose very air was thrilling with devotion, whose very silence and seclusion were fraught with mystery.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1980" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>院子里，在大雨罩遮盖下，门口的石阶上铺着地毯；一到前厅就闻到一股紫罗兰的香味，四壁上的帷幔很厚实，屋内的气温宜人。一扇彩绘大玻璃窗，上面的玻璃有黄色的，也有玫瑰色的，射出淡黄色的肉色光线，照亮着宽大的楼梯。楼梯脚下，有一个木雕黑人，手捧一只银制托盘，盘里摆满了来访者的名片；还有四个白色大理石女子，乳房裸露，手擎高脚台灯。前厅里和楼梯平台上，陈列着中国青铜器皿和景泰蓝瓶，里面插满了鲜花，还有铺着波斯坐毯的长沙发，铺着古色古香毯子的扶手椅，这些陈设把前厅和二楼平台装饰成候见厅。厅内经常放着男客的大衣和帽子，帷幔和地毯把房间包得严严的，发不出一点声响，一进门就觉得是在屏息冥思，仿佛进了一座小教堂，因虔诚而浑身战栗。每扇门都关得严严的，屋内一派寂静气氛使人产生神秘的感觉。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1981');"><p>Nana only opened the large and somewhat too-sumptuous Louis XVI drawing room on those gala nights when she received society from the Tuileries or strangers of distinction. Ordinarily she only came downstairs at mealtimes, and she would feel rather lost on such days as she lunched by herself in the lofty dining room with its Gobelin tapestry and its monumental sideboard, adorned with old porcelain and marvelous pieces of ancient plate. She used to go upstairs again as quickly as possible, for her home was on the first floor, in the three rooms, the bed, dressing and small drawing room above described. Twice already she had done the bedchamber up anew: on the first occasion in mauve satin, on the second in blue silk under lace. But she had not been satisfied with this; it had struck her as "nohowish," and she was still unsuccessfully seeking for new colors and designs. On the elaborately upholstered bed, which was as low as a sofa, there were twenty thousand francs' worth of POINT DE VENISE lace. The furniture was lacquered blue and white under designs in silver filigree, and everywhere lay such numbers of white bearskins that they hid the carpet. This was a luxurious caprice on Nana's part, she having never been able to break herself of the habit of sitting on the floor to take her stockings off. Next door to the bedroom the little saloon was full of an amusing medley of exquisitely artistic objects. Against the hangings of pale rose-colored silk—a faded Turkish rose color, embroidered with gold thread—a whole world of them stood sharply outlined. They were from every land and in every possible style. There were Italian cabinets, Spanish and Portuguese coffers, models of Chinese pagodas, a Japanese screen of precious workmanship, besides china, bronzes, embroidered silks, hangings of the finest needlework. Armchairs wide as beds and sofas deep as alcoves suggested voluptuous idleness and the somnolent life of the seraglio. The prevailing tone of the room was old gold blended with green and red, and nothing it contained too forcibly indicated the presence of the courtesan save the luxuriousness of the seats. Only two "biscuit" statuettes, a woman in her shift, hunting for fleas, and another with nothing at all on, walking on her hands and waving her feet in the air, sufficed to sully the room with a note of stupid originality.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1981" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大客厅具有路易十六时代的风格，陈设过分豪华，只在举行盛大晚会时，娜娜才打开它来接待社伊勒里宫的达官显贵和外国宾客。平时，她只在吃饭的时候才下楼，有时她一个人单独在饭厅里就餐时，失落之感油然而生。餐厅很高，墙上挂着巴黎戈贝兰壁毯，还有一个硕大无朋的食具橱，里面放着古老的瓷器，令人赞叹的老式银餐具，这些东西令人赏心悦目。她吃完饭后，便赶快上楼。她住在二楼，占有三个房间：一间卧室，一间梳妆室和一间小客厅。她的卧室已经重新布置过两次，第一次用的是淡紫色的缎子，第二次用的是镶花边的蓝色绸料；但是她还不满意，觉得这样显得平淡无奇，她还在想新的花样，却终未想出来。一张垫软垫的床矮得像沙发，床上的威尼斯针钩花边值二万法郎。家具都漆成白色和蓝色，上面还镶着银色细丝；屋子里到处都散放着白熊皮，多得把地毯都盖住了。娜娜有一种怪癖，也是一种穷奢极欲的表现，她喜欢坐在地上脱长袜子，这个习惯始终没有改掉。在卧室旁边的小客厅里，小玩意儿摆得杂乱无章，它们全是精美的艺术品；墙上挂的是浅玫瑰红丝绸帷幔，即一种褪了色的土耳其玫瑰红颜色，上面织着金线，沿着帷幔，摆放着各个国家、各种风格的物品，显得分外醒目，有意大利珍品收藏柜，西班牙和葡萄牙的小箱子，中国的小宝塔，日本的精贵屏风，还有瓷器，青铜器，绣花丝绸，细针钩花边的地毯；扶手椅宽大得像床，长沙发很深，颇像放床的凹室，坐在上面感到软绵绵、懒洋洋的，不禁使人联想到后宫里那种昏昏欲睡的生活。这间房子保持着淡黄褐色的基本色调，辅色是绿色和红色；除了几张椅子格外舒服外，没有任何东西能充分表明这里是妓女居住的地方；只有两尊本色瓷器女人塑像，一个女人穿着衬衫在捉跳蚤，另一个身上一丝不挂，两脚朝天，双手着地行走。这两件原始、愚蠢之作，犹如一个污点，把整个客厅的艺术格调破坏了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1982');"><p>Through a door, which was nearly always ajar, the dressing room was visible. It was all in marble and glass with a white bath, silver jugs and basins and crystal and ivory appointments. A drawn curtain filled the place with a clear twilight which seemed to slumber in the warm scent of violets, that suggestive perfume peculiar to Nana wherewith the whole house, from the roof to the very courtyard, was penetrated.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1982" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>透过一扇几乎一直开着的门，可以望见那间梳妆室，映入眼帘的尽是大理石和镜子，里面有白色的浴缸，银水壶和银脸盆，还有水晶和象牙饰物。从一块垂落的窗帘中，射进来一道白色的微光，这道微光似乎被紫罗兰的香味熏得昏昏欲睡，从娜娜身上发出来的这股撩人的香味散发到整个公馆和院子里。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1983');"><p>The furnishing of the house was a most important undertaking. Nana certainly had Zoe with her, that girl so devoted to her fortunes. For months she had been tranquilly awaiting this abrupt, new departure, as became a woman who was certain of her powers of prescience, and now she was triumphant; she was mistress of the house and was putting by a round sum while serving Madame as honestly as possible. But a solitary lady's maid was no longer sufficient. A butler, a coachman, a porter and a cook were wanted. Besides, it was necessary to fill the stables. It was then that Labordette made himself most useful. He undertook to perform all sorts of errands which bored the count; he made a comfortable job of the purchase of horses; he visited the coachbuilders; he guided the young woman in her choice of things. She was to be met with at the shops, leaning on his arm. Labordette even got in the servants—Charles, a great, tall coachman, who had been in service with the Duc de Corbreuse; Julien, a little, smiling, much-becurled butler, and a married couple, of whom the wife Victorine became cook while the husband Francois was taken on as porter and footman. The last mentioned in powder and breeches wore Nana's livery, which was a sky-blue one adorned with silver lace, and he received visitors in the hall. The whole thing was princely in the correctness of its style.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1983" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>给这座房屋配备必要的用品是一件大事。娜娜幸亏有了佐爱。这个女仆对她的发迹立下了汗马功劳，她很敏感，坚信娜娜一定会发迹，几个月来，她一直在静静地等待着这一天的倏然来到。如今佐爱洋洋得意成了公馆的女管家，她通过忠心耿耿地侍候太太，让自己发财。但是娜娜仅有一个女仆是不够的，还必须有一个膳食总管，一个马车夫，一个门房和一个厨娘。此外，还得建几个马厩。于是，拉博德特便成了非常有用的人，伯爵不愿意干的跑腿事情，他都承担下来了。他用不正当的手段买下了几匹马，跑各个马车商店，为少妇挑选东西出谋划策，人们经常看见他挽着娜娜的膀子出入于各家店铺。他甚至还带来一班仆人：一个是夏尔，是个身材魁梧的马车夫，他来自德科布勒兹公爵家；一个是朱利安，矮个子，满头鬈发，总是笑吟吟的，他是膳食总管；还有一对夫妻，妻子名叫维克托里娜，是厨娘，丈夫叫弗朗索瓦，是来当门房和听差的。弗朗索瓦穿着短裤，脸上搽了粉，上身穿着娜娜规定的浅蓝色和银色饰带的仆人制服，站在前厅里接待客人。这样的穿着和端庄的神态无异于王公贵族府邸。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1984');"><p>At the end of two months the house was set going. The cost had been more than three hundred thousand francs. There were eight horses in the stables, and five carriages in the coach houses, and of these five one was a landau with silver embellishments, which for the moment occupied the attention of all Paris. And amid this great wealth Nana began settling down and making her nest. After the third representation of the Petite Duchesse she had quitted the theater, leaving Bordenave to struggle on against a bankruptcy which, despite the count's money, was imminent. Nevertheless, she was still bitter about her failure. It added to that other bitterness, the lesson Fontan had given her, a shameful lesson for which she held all men responsible. Accordingly she now declared herself very firm and quite proof against sudden infatuations, but thoughts of vengeance took no hold of her volatile brain. What did maintain a hold on it in the hours when she was not indignant was an ever-wakeful lust of expenditure, added to a natural contempt for the man who paid and to a perpetual passion for consumption and waste, which took pride in the ruin of her lovers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1984" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>到了第二个月，公馆里的一切都配备齐全了。共计花掉三万多法郎，马厩里有八匹马，车库里有五辆马车，其中一辆带银饰的双篷四轮马车，一时吸引了全巴黎的人。娜娜就在这样的财富中安顿下来，建立了自己的家。她演了三场《小公爵夫人》，便离开了剧院。她抛下了博尔德纳夫，让他在破产的边缘上挣扎，伯爵的资助对他也无济于事。然而，这次演戏的失败使她苦不堪言。加之与丰唐的那段共同生活的教训，她认为所有的男人都是卑鄙的。因此，她认为自己现在很坚强了，不至于因热恋上一个男人而不顾一切了。但是，她的头脑很单纯，复仇的想法并没有坚持多久。除了生气的时候，她心里想的总是怎样花钱，她对拿钱供她不断挥霍的男人，天生怀着蔑视，她对情夫们的破产而感到洋洋得意。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1985');"><p>At starting Nana put the count on a proper footing and clearly mapped out the conditions of their relationship. The count gave twelve thousand francs monthly, presents excepted, and demanded nothing in return save absolute fidelity. She swore fidelity but insisted also on being treated with the utmost consideration, on enjoying complete liberty as mistress of the house and on having her every wish respected. For instance, she was to receive her friends every day, and he was to come only at stated times. In a word, he was to repose a blind confidence in her in everything. And when he was seized with jealous anxiety and hesitated to grant what she wanted, she stood on her dignity and threatened to give him back all he had given or even swore by little Louiset to perform what she promised. This was to suffice him. There was no love where mutual esteem was wanting. At the end of the first month Muffat respected her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1985" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜首先确定了伯爵在公馆里的地位。她订了他们的关系规章。伯爵每月拿出一万二千法郎，礼物还不算在内，作为回报，他只能要求她对他绝对忠实。她发誓忠实于他。但她要求他尊重她，要充分尊重她的个人意愿，她要有主妇的全部自由。这样，她每天接待自己的朋友，而伯爵只能在规定的时间里来；总之，对于一切事情，他对她要盲目信任。每当他因吃醋而惴惴不安，犹豫不决时，她便摆出一副尊严的样子，威胁说要把一切东西还给他，或者用她的小路易的脑袋发誓。这样伯爵就满意了，没有尊重就没有爱情。直到第一月末．缪法是很尊重她的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1986');"><p>But she desired and obtained still more. Soon she began to influence him, as became a good-natured courtesan. When he came to her in a moody condition she cheered him up, confessed him and then gave him good advice. Little by little she interested herself in the annoyances of his home life, in his wife, in his daughter, in his love affairs and financial difficulties; she was very sensible, very fair and right-minded. On one occasion only did she let anger get the better of her, and that was when he confided to her that doubtless Daguenet was going to ask for his daughter Estelle in marriage. When the count began making himself notorious Daguenet had thought it a wise move to break off with Nana. He had treated her like a base hussy and had sworn to snatch his future father-in-law out of the creature's clutches. In return Nana abused her old Mimi in a charming fashion. He was a renegade who had devoured his fortune in the company of vile women; he had no moral sense. True, he did not let them pay him money, but he profited by that of others and only repaid them at rare intervals with a bouquet or a dinner. And when the count seemed inclined to find excuses for these failings she bluntly informed him that Daguenet had enjoyed her favors, and she added disgusting particulars. Muffat had grown ashen-pale. There was no question of the young man now. This would teach him to be lacking in gratitude!
</p></origin><translate id="div_1986" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但是，娜娜得寸进尺，不久，她就像忠贞女子一样对他施加影响。当伯爵怏怏不乐时，她就逗他高兴，让他说出内心不高兴的原因，然后开导他。渐渐地，他内心的烦恼，他妻子和女儿的事情，他内心的想法和金钱上的问题，她都一一过问，而且表现得合情合理，非常公正，非常诚实。只有一次，她没有控制住自己的情绪，发起火来。一天伯爵告诉她，达盖内可能要向他的女儿爱丝泰勒求婚。自从伯爵与娜娜的关系引起人们的注意以来，达盖内认为最巧妙的办法就是与娜娜断绝关系，把她看成淫妇了事，并发誓要把他未来的岳父从娜娜的魔爪中夺回来。因此，她就拼命讲她过去的咪咪的坏话：他是一个好色之徒，与一些不三不四的女人在一起厮混，把家当挥霍殆尽；他没有道德，他虽然不用女人的钱来养活自己，但是他经常利用女人的钱，只是不时给女人送一束鲜花或请女人吃一顿晚饭；但是伯爵听了她的话，似乎原谅他的这些缺点，于是，她就直截了当地告诉他，达盖内同她睡过觉，并且讲了一些不堪入耳的细节。刹那间，缪法脸色变得苍白。这个年轻人与他女儿的婚事就不必谈了。这次给了忘恩负义的达盖内一个很好的教训。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1987');"><p>Meanwhile the house had not been entirely furnished, when one evening after she had lavished the most energetic promises of fidelity on Muffat Nana kept the Count Xavier de Vandeuvres for the night. For the last fortnight he had been paying her assiduous court, visiting her and sending presents of flowers, and now she gave way not so much out of sudden infatuation as to prove that she was a free woman. The idea of gain followed later when, the day after, Vandeuvres helped her to pay a bill which she did not wish to mention to the other man. From Vandeuvres she would certainly derive from eight to ten thousand francs a month, and this would prove very useful as pocket money. In those days he was finishing the last of his fortune in an access of burning, feverish folly. His horses and Lucy had devoured three of his farms, and at one gulp Nana was going to swallow his last chateau, near Amiens. He seemed in a hurry to sweep everything away, down to the ruins of the old tower built by a Vandeuvres under Philip Augustus. He was mad for ruin and thought it a great thing to leave the last golden bezants of his coat of arms in the grasp of this courtesan, whom the world of Paris desired. He, too, accepted Nana's conditions, leaving her entire freedom of action and claiming her caresses only on certain days. He was not even naively impassioned enough to require her to make vows. Muffat suspected nothing. As to Vandeuvres, he knew things would take place for a certainty, but he never made the least allusion to them and pretended total ignorance, while his lips wore the subtle smile of the skeptical man of pleasure who does not seek the impossible, provided he can have his day and that Paris is aware of it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1987" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而，公馆里的家具还没有配备齐全。一天晚上，娜娜滔滔不绝地对缪法作了许多山盟海誓以后，竟然把格扎维埃德旺德夫尔伯爵留下来同宿。旺德夫尔伯爵已苦苦追求她两个星期了，每次来看她都带着一束鲜花。她终于答应了他，她这样做并非因为一时恋迷上了他，而是为了证明她是自由的。从他那里捞好处是事后才想到的，就在她接待旺德夫尔的第二天，他替她还了一笔债款，这笔债她是不愿意向其他男人讲的。从那以后，她每月从他那里得到八千至一万法郎；这笔零花钱对她很有用。旺德夫尔一时头脑发热，把他的全部家当挥霍殆尽。他为马匹和吕西已经花掉了他的三个庄园，娜娜又要一口吞掉他的靠近亚眠的别墅；他急于要把全部财产一扫而光，连他的祖宗在菲利普—奥古斯特①治下建造的古堡的残垣断壁也不放过。他渴望破产到了疯狂的地步，他觉得把象征他的家族的徽章上的最后一枚金色圆形图案也拱手交给这个全巴黎为之垂涎的妓女是件崇高的事情。他也接受了娜娜的全部条件，她有完全行动自由，只有在规定的日子才能享受到她的温情，甚至连叫她发誓的天真热情也没有。缪法对娜娜的誓言毫不怀疑。而旺德夫尔呢，对这些一清二楚；不过，他从不丝毫流露出来。他假装全然不知，脸上总是堆着寻欢作乐、玩世不恭者微妙的笑容，他对办不到的事情总不提出要求，只要他在规定的时间与娜娜寻欢作乐，全巴黎的人都知道，他就满足了。

The staff of servants was complete in the stable, in the kitchen and in my lady's chamber. Zoe organized everything and passed successfully through the most unforeseen difficulties. The household moved as easily as the scenery in a theater and was regulated like a grand administrative concern. Indeed, it worked with such precision that during the early months there were no jars and no derangements. Madame, however, pained Zoe extremely with her imprudent acts, her sudden fits of unwisdom, her mad bravado. Still the lady's maid grew gradually lenient, for she had noticed that she made increased profits in seasons of wanton waste when Madame had committed a folly which must be made up for. It was then that the presents began raining on her, and she fished up many a louis out of the troubled waters.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1988" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从那以后，娜娜的家里真正是应有尽有。仆人都有了，马厩里、厨房里、太太的卧室里的仆人都有了。佐爱负责统管一切，对一些最错综复杂的出乎意料的事情，她总能处理得妥妥当当；家里安排得像剧院里一样有条不紊，像大行政机关里一样井井有条，一切运转得如此准确无误，开头两个月里，没有发生任何冲突和不协调现象。只是太太经常犯轻举、冒失、心血来潮和冒充好汉的毛病，给佐爱惹来太多的麻烦。因此，这个贴身女仆也就慢慢变得办事懈怠了，而且她还发觉在乱糟糟的时候，即太太做了蠢事而需要补救时，她就能从中捞到较大的好处。这时候，礼物像雨点般地落到她手中，她就混水摸鱼，从中捞到一些金路易。

When Nana was able to rejoin them in the drawing room downstairs she scolded them both, and Zoe pursed up her lips and took her departure with a vexed expression, remarking that she had only been anxious to give Madame a pleasure. Georges was so glad to see Nana again and gazed at her with such delight that his fine eyes began filling with tears. The miserable days were over now; his mother believed him to have grown reasonable and had allowed him to leave Les Fondettes. Accordingly, the moment he had reached the terminus, he had got a conveyance in order the more quickly to come and kiss his sweet darling. He spoke of living at her side in future, as he used to do down in the country when he waited for her, barefooted, in the bedroom at La Mignotte. And as he told her about himself, he let his fingers creep forward, for he longed to touch her after that cruel year of separation. Then he got possession of her hands, felt about the wide sleeves of her dressing jacket, traveled up as far as her shoulders.

Nevertheless, when he arrived daily at four o'clock he seemed so wretched that she was often fain to be as compliant as of old and would hide him in cupboards and constantly allow him to pick up the crumbs from Beauty's table. He hardly ever left the house now and became as much one of its inmates as the little dog Bijou. Together they nestled among Mistress's skirts and enjoyed a little of her at a time, even when she was with another man, while doles of sugar and stray caresses not seldom fell to their share in her hours of loneliness and boredom.

Georges, who was hiding from his elder brother, was seized with despairing apprehension, for he feared the latter might adopt violent tactics, and as his tenderness for Nana was so nervously expansive that he could not keep anything from her, he soon began talking of nothing but his big brother, a great, strong fellow, who was capable of all kinds of things.

As she walked up and down she kept jerking out such little phrases as:

Georges began crossing on tiptoe on the other side of the room, for he was anxious to obey the young woman. But the sound of voices retained him, and he hesitated in such anguish of mind that his knees gave way under him. He began imagining that a dread catastrophe would befall, that blows would be struck, that something abominable would happen, which would make Nana everlastingly odious to him. And so he could not withstand the temptation to come back and put his ear against the door. He heard very ill, for the thick portieres deadened every sound, but he managed to catch certain words spoken by Philippe, stern phrases in which such terms as "mere child," "family," "honor," were distinctly audible. He was so anxious about his darling's possible answers that his heart beat violently and filled his head with a confused, buzzing noise. She was sure to give vent to a "Dirty blackguard!" or to a "Leave me bloody well alone! I'm in my own house!" But nothing happened—not a breath came from her direction. Nana seemed dead in there! Soon even his brother's voice grew gentler, and he could not make it out at all, when a strange murmuring sound finally stupefied him. Nana was sobbing! For a moment or two he was the prey of contending feelings and knew not whether to run away or to fall upon Philippe. But just then Zoe came into the room, and he withdrew from the door, ashamed at being thus surprised.

He was casting sidelong glances in the direction of the drawing room.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2025" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们两人就谈了这些，再也没有继续说下去。佐爱没有离开卧室。又过了整整一刻钟，她掉过头来，没有看到孩子发火，这时他行动不能自由，事情究竟怎样，他蒙在鼓里，脸色顿时变得苍白。他向客厅里瞟了几眼。他俩在客厅里呆了那么久，究竟在干什么呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2026');"><p>Maybe Nana was still crying. The other must have grown savage and have dealt her blows. Thus when Zoe finally took her departure he ran to the door and once more pressed his ear against it.

Besides, almost directly afterward, Nana conducted Philippe to the head of the stairs, and there was an exchange of cordial and familiar phrases.

She began dressing to go out, and he watched her with his great, sad eyes. Doubtless he was very glad that matters had got settled, for he would have preferred death to a rupture of their connection, but deep down in his heart there was a silent anguish, a profound sense of pain, which he had no experience of and dared not talk about. How Philippe quieted their mother's fears he never knew, but three days later she returned to Les Fondettes, apparently satisfied. On the evening of her return, at Nana's house, he trembled when Francois announced the lieutenant, but the latter jested gaily and treated him like a young rascal, whose escapade he had favored as something not likely to have any consequences. The lad's heart was sore within him; he scarcely dared move and blushed girlishly at the least word that was spoken to him. He had not lived much in Philippe's society; he was ten years his junior, and he feared him as he would a father, from whom stories about women are concealed. Accordingly he experienced an uneasy sense of shame when he saw him so free in Nana's company and heard him laugh uproariously, as became a man who was plunging into a life of pleasure with the gusto born of magnificent health. Nevertheless, when his brother shortly began to present himself every day, Georges ended by getting somewhat used to it all. Nana was radiant.

It was with scenes such as these that she kept him in unquestioning and docile submission. She had long since succeeded in imposing Georges on him as a young vagabond who, she declared, amused her. She made him dine with Philippe, and the count behaved with great amiability. When they rose from table he took the young man on one side and asked news of his mother. From that time forth the young Hugons, Vandeuvres and Muffat were openly about the house and shook hands as guests and intimates might have done. It was a more convenient arrangement than the previous one. Muffat alone still abstained discreetly from too-frequent visits, thus adhering to the ceremonious policy of an ordinary strange caller. At night when Nana was sitting on her bearskins drawing off her stockings, he would talk amicably about the other three gentlemen and lay especial stress on Philippe, who was loyalty itself.

She had men for every minute of the night, and money overflowed even among the brushes and combs in the drawers of her dressing table. But all this had ceased to satisfy her; she felt that there was a void somewhere or other, an empty place provocative of yawns. Her life dragged on, devoid of occupation, and successive days only brought back the same monotonous hours. Tomorrow had ceased to be; she lived like a bird: sure of her food and ready to perch and roost on any branch which she came to. This certainty of food and drink left her lolling effortless for whole days, lulled her to sleep in conventual idleness and submission as though she were the prisoner of her trade. Never going out except to drive, she was losing her walking powers. She reverted to low childish tastes, would kiss Bijou from morning to night and kill time with stupid pleasures while waiting for the man whose caresses she tolerated with an appearance of complaisant lassitude. Amid this species of self-abandonment she now took no thought about anything save her personal beauty; her sole care was to look after herself, to wash and to perfume her limbs, as became one who was proud of being able to undress at any moment and in face of anybody without having to blush for her imperfections.

Bijou, the Scotch griffon dog, used to lick her face and wake her, and then would ensue a game of play lasting some five minutes, during which the dog would race about over her arms and legs and cause Count Muffat much distress. Bijou was the first little male he had ever been jealous of. It was not at all proper, he thought, that an animal should go poking its nose under the bedclothes like that! After this Nana would proceed to her dressing room, where she took a bath. Toward eleven o'clock Francois would come and do up her hair before beginning the elaborate manipulations of the afternoon.

This lady would arrive from unknown regions in the morning, wearing her extravagantly quaint hats, and would return at night to that mysterious existence of hers, about which no one ever troubled. But the hardest to bear were the two or three hours between lunch and the toilet. On ordinary occasions she proposed a game of bezique to her old friend; on others she would read the Figaro, in which the theatrical echoes and the fashionable news interested her. Sometimes she even opened a book, for she fancied herself in literary matters. Her toilet kept her till close on five o'clock, and then only she would wake from her daylong drowse and drive out or receive a whole mob of men at her own house. She would often dine abroad and always go to bed very late, only to rise again on the morrow with the same languor as before and to begin another day, differing in nothing from its predecessor.

For a fortnight at a time she forgot all about him, and then would follow an access of maternal love, and she would hurry off on foot with all the modesty and tenderness becoming a good mother. On such occasions she would be the bearer of snuff for her aunt and of oranges and biscuits for the child, the kind of presents one takes to a hospital. Or again she would drive up in her landau on her return from the Bois, decked in costumes, the resplendence of which greatly excited the dwellers in the solitary street. Since her niece's magnificent elevation Mme Lerat had been puffed up with vanity. She rarely presented herself in the Avenue de Villiers, for she was pleased to remark that it wasn't her place to do so, but she enjoyed triumphs in her own street. She was delighted when the young woman arrived in dresses that had cost four or five thousand francs and would be occupied during the whole of the next day in showing off her presents and in citing prices which quite stupefied the neighbors. As often as not, Nana kept Sunday free for the sake of "her family," and on such occasions, if Muffat invited her, she would refuse with the smile of a good little shopwoman. It was impossible, she would answer; she was dining at her aunt's; she was going to see Baby. Moreover, that poor little man Louiset was always ill. He was almost three years old, growing quite a great boy! But he had had an eczema on the back of his neck, and now concretions were forming in his ears, which pointed, it was feared, to decay of the bones of the skull. When she saw how pale he looked, with his spoiled blood and his flabby flesh all out in yellow patches, she would become serious, but her principal feeling would be one of astonishment. What could be the matter with the little love that he should grow so weakly? She, his mother, was so strong and well!

But whatever happened she still felt that stupid, idle void, which caused her, as it were, to suffer internal cramps. Despite the incessant infatuations that possessed her heart, she would stretch out her arms with a gesture of immense weariness the moment she was left alone. Solitude rendered her low spirited at once, for it brought her face to face with the emptiness and boredom within her. Extremely gay by nature and profession, she became dismal in solitude and would sum up her life in the following ejaculation, which recurred incessantly between her yawns:

Washed and dressed and duly installed in the house in the Avenue de Villiers, during three days the girl talked of Saint-Lazare and the annoyances the sisters had caused her and how those dirty police people had put her down on the official list. Nana grew indignant and comforted her and vowed she would get her name taken off, even though she herself should have to go and find out the minister of the interior. Meanwhile there was no sort of hurry: nobody would come and search for her at Nana's—that was certain. And thereupon the two women began to pass tender afternoons together, making numberless endearing little speeches and mingling their kisses with laughter. The same little sport, which the arrival of the plainclothes men had interrupted in the Rue de Laval, was beginning again in a jocular sort of spirit. One fine evening, however, it became serious, and Nana, who had been so disgusted at Laure's, now understood what it meant. She was upset and enraged by it, the more so because Satin disappeared on the morning of the fourth day. No one had seen her go out. She had, indeed, slipped away in her new dress, seized by a longing for air, full of sentimental regret for her old street existence.

Nana had come near beating Francois for not throwing himself across the door through which Satin escaped. She did her best, however, to control herself, and talked of Satin as a dirty swine. Oh, it would teach her to pick filthy things like that out of the gutter!

In the evening she suddenly asked for her carriage and had herself driven to Laure's. It had occurred to her that she would find Satin at the table d'hote in the Rue des Martyrs. She was not going there for the sake of seeing her again but in order to catch her one in the face! As a matter of fact Satin was dining at a little table with Mme Robert. Seeing Nana, she began to laugh, but the former, though wounded to the quick, did not make a scene. On the contrary, she was very sweet and very compliant. She paid for champagne made five or six tablefuls tipsy and then carried off Satin when Mme Robert was in the closets. Not till they were in the carriage did she make a mordant attack on her, threatening to kill her if she did it again.

On days such as these Laure, sleek and tight-laced as ever would kiss everyone with an air of expanded maternity. Yet notwithstanding all these circumstances Satin's blue eyes and pure virginal face remained as calm as heretofore; torn, beaten and pestered by the two women, she would simply remark that it was a funny business, and they would have done far better to make it up at once. It did no good to slap her; she couldn't cut herself in two, however much she wanted to be nice to everybody. It was Nana who finally carried her off in triumph, so assiduously had she loaded Satin with kindnesses and presents.

She, however, now knew her power over him and ceased to consider his feelings. And from that time forth Satin was openly installed in the house on the same footing as the gentlemen. Vandeuvres had not needed anonymous letters in order to understand how matters stood, and accordingly he joked and tried to pick jealous quarrels with Satin. Philippe and Georges, on their parts, treated her like a jolly good fellow, shaking hands with her and cracking the riskiest jokes imaginable.

While she was dining by herself Daguenet had appeared on the scene, for although he had reformed, he still occasionally dropped in under the influence of his old vicious inclinations. He hoped of course that no one would meet him in these black recesses, dedicated to the town's lowest depravity. Accordingly even Nana's presence seemed to embarrass him at the outset. But he was not the man to run away and, coming forward with a smile, he asked if Madame would be so kind as to allow him to dine at her table. Noticing his jocular tone, Nana assumed her magnificently frigid demeanor and icily replied:

Nevertheless, he still talked jokingly, not wishing the matter to grow serious, and after he had put on his gloves he demanded the hand of Mlle Estelle de Beuville in the strict regulation manner. Nana ended by laughing, as though she had been tickled. Oh, that Mimi! It was impossible to bear him a grudge! Daguenet's great successes with ladies of her class were due to the sweetness of his voice, a voice of such musical purity and pliancy as to have won him among courtesans the sobriquet of "Velvet-Mouth." Every woman would give way to him when he lulled her with his sonorous caresses. He knew this power and rocked Nana to sleep with endless words, telling her all kinds of idiotic anecdotes. When they left the table d'hote she was blushing rosy-red; she trembled as she hung on his arm; he had reconquered her. As it was very fine, she sent her carriage away and walked with him as far as his own place, where she went upstairs with him naturally enough. Two hours later, as she was dressing again, she said:

For the matter of that, it was the customary Thursday dinner, and Muffat, Vandeuvres, the young Hugons and Satin were present. The count arrived early. He stood in need of eighty thousand francs wherewith to free the young woman from two or three debts and to give her a set of sapphires she was dying to possess. As he had already seriously lessened his capital, he was in search of a lender, for he did not dare to sell another property. With the advice of Nana herself he had addressed himself to Labordette, but the latter, deeming it too heavy an undertaking, had mentioned it to the hairdresser Francis, who willingly busied himself in such affairs in order to oblige his lady clients. The count put himself into the hands of these gentlemen but expressed a formal desire not to appear in the matter, and they both undertook to keep in hand the bill for a hundred thousand francs which he was to sign, excusing themselves at the same time for charging a matter of twenty thousand francs interest and loudly denouncing the blackguard usurers to whom, they declared, it had been necessary to have recourse. When Muffat had himself announced, Francis was putting the last touches to Nana's coiffure. Labordette also was sitting familiarly in the dressing room, as became a friend of no consequence. Seeing the count, he discreetly placed a thick bundle of bank notes among the powders and pomades, and the bill was signed on the marble-topped dressing table. Nana was anxious to keep Labordette to dinner, but he declined—he was taking a rich foreigner about Paris. Muffat, however, led him aside and begged him to go to Becker, the jeweler, and bring him back thence the set of sapphires, which he wanted to present the young woman by way of surprise that very evening. Labordette willingly undertook the commission, and half an hour later Julien handed the jewel case mysteriously to the count.

To think all that money was to go to tradespeople! It was a disgusting thought. After soup had been served she grew sentimental, and in the splendid dining room, glittering with plate and glass, she talked of the bliss of poverty. The men were in evening dress, Nana in a gown of white embroidered satin, while Satin made a more modest appearance in black silk with a simple gold heart at her throat, which was a present from her kind friend. Julien and Francois waited behind the guests and were assisted in this by Zoe. All three looked most dignified.

But Satin, having peeled a pear, came and ate it behind her darling, leaning on her shoulder the while and whispering sundry little remarks in her ear, at which they both laughed very loudly. By and by she wanted to share her last piece of pear with Nana and presented it to her between her teeth. Whereupon there was a great nibbling of lips, and the pear was finished amid kisses. At this there was a burst of comic protest from the gentlemen, Philippe shouting to them to take it easy and Vandeuvres asking if one ought to leave the room. Georges, meanwhile, had come and put his arm round Satin's waist and had brought her back to her seat.

At that hour of the evening the light played discreetly over coffers, bronzes and china, lighting up silver or ivory inlaid work, bringing into view the polished contours of a carved stick and gleaming over a panel with glossy silky reflections. The fire, which had been burning since the afternoon, was dying out in glowing embers. It was very warm—the air behind the curtains and hangings was languid with warmth. The room was full of Nana's intimate existence: a pair of gloves, a fallen handkerchief, an open book, lay scattered about, and their owner seemed present in careless attire with that well-known odor of violets and that species of untidiness which became her in her character of good-natured courtesan and had such a charming effect among all those rich surroundings. The very armchairs, which were as wide as beds, and the sofas, which were as deep as alcoves, invited to slumber oblivious of the flight of time and to tender whispers in shadowy corners.

After that Nana talked to the four men as charmingly as hostess could. During the day she had read a novel which was at that time making a good deal of noise. It was the history of a courtesan, and Nana was very indignant, declaring the whole thing to be untrue and expressing angry dislike to that kind of monstrous literature which pretends to paint from nature. "Just as though one could describe everything," she said. Just as though a novel ought not to be written so that the reader may while away an hour pleasantly! In the matter of books and of plays Nana had very decided opinions: she wanted tender and noble productions, things that would set her dreaming and would elevate her soul. Then allusion being made in the course of conversation to the troubles agitating Paris, the incendiary articles in the papers, the incipient popular disturbances which followed the calls to arms nightly raised at public meetings, she waxed wroth with the Republicans. What on earth did those dirty people who never washed really want? Were folks not happy? Had not the emperor done everything for the people? A nice filthy lot of people! She knew 'em; she could talk about 'em, and, quite forgetting the respect which at dinner she had just been insisting should be paid to her humble circle in the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or, she began blackguarding her own class with all the terror and disgust peculiar to a woman who had risen successfully above it. That very afternoon she had read in the Figaro an account of the proceedings at a public meeting which had verged on the comic. Owing to the slang words that had been used and to the piggish behavior of a drunken man who had got himself chucked, she was laughing at those proceedings still.

Muffat, who did not play, expressed great astonishment, but Vandeuvres smilingly alluded to his imminent ruin, about which Paris was already talking. The kind of death you chose did not much matter, he averred; the great thing was to die handsomely. For some time past Nana had noticed that he was nervous and had a sharp downward droop of the mouth and a fitful gleam in the depths of his clear eyes. But he retained his haughty aristocratic manner and the delicate elegance of his impoverished race, and as yet these strange manifestations were only, so to speak, momentary fits of vertigo overcoming a brain already sapped by play and by debauchery. One night as he lay beside her he had frightened her with a dreadful story. He had told her he contemplated shutting himself up in his stable and setting fire to himself and his horses at such time as he should have devoured all his substance. His only hope at that period was a horse, Lusignan by name, which he was training for the Prix de Paris. He was living on this horse, which was the sole stay of his shaken credit, and whenever Nana grew exacting he would put her off till June and to the probability of Lusignan's winning.

Vandeuvres lingered some minutes longer, feeling his way, as it were, and waiting to find out if, by any chance, some important business would oblige Muffat to cede him his place. Soon, however, when he saw the count deliberately taking up his quarters for the night, he desisted from his purpose and said good-by, as became a man of tact.

</p></origin><translate id="div_2167" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！你吃醋啦，难道这是真的！……你冷静想一想。当时他对你说了我的坏话，我气坏了……今天我感到很抱歉。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2168');"><p>But over Muffat's shoulder she met Satin's gaze. And she left him anxiously and in a grave voice continued:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2168" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她从伯爵的肩上看过去，目光正好与萨丹的目光相遇。她感到心慌，立即松开他，一本正经地说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2169');"><p>"This marriage must come off, my friend; I don't want to prevent your daughter's happiness. The young man's most charming; you could not possibly find a better sort."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2169" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的朋友，这门亲事一定要做成，我不想妨碍你女儿的幸福。这个青年很好，你是找不到这样的好青年的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2170');"><p>And she launched into extraordinary praise of Daguenet. The count had again taken her hands; he no longer refused now; he would see about it, he said, they would talk the matter over. By and by, when he spoke of going to bed, she sank her voice and excused herself. It was impossible; she was not well. If he loved her at all he would not insist! Nevertheless, he was obstinate; he refused to go away, and she was beginning to give in when she met Satin's eyes once more. Then she grew inflexible. No, the thing was out of the question! The count, deeply moved and with a look of suffering, had risen and was going in quest of his hat. But in the doorway he remembered the set of sapphires; he could feel the case in his pocket. He had been wanting to hide it at the bottom of the bed so that when she entered it before him she should feel it against her legs. Since dinnertime he had been meditating this little surprise like a schoolboy, and now, in trouble and anguish of heart at being thus dismissed, he gave her the case without further ceremony.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2170" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，她大谈达盖内的优点。伯爵抓住她的手，他不再说不行了，他再考虑一下，以后再谈这事。然后他提出要上床睡觉，娜娜压低了嗓门，对他说出一些理由，不能奉陪，她说月经来了，如果他真的有点爱她，就不应该强求。然而，他很固执，坚决不走，她有点软下来了，这时她又遇到了萨丹的目光，于是，她的态度又强硬起来。不行，这是不可能的。伯爵非常激动，脸上显出痛苦的表情，他站起来，找他的帽子，然而，他刚走到门口，忽然想起那条蓝宝石项链，因为他感觉到口袋里的首饰匣子。他原来打算把它藏在床里边，等她第一个上床后，一伸腿就可以碰到项链，这是大孩子送礼物让对方惊讶的一种方法。他从吃晚饭时就在想这个方法。他现在这样被打发走，心里惶惶不安，怏怏不乐，他生硬地把首饰匣交给她。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2171');"><p>"What is it?" she queried. "Sapphires? Dear me! Oh yes, it's that set. How sweet you are! But I say, my darling, d'you believe it's the same one? In the shopwindow it made a much greater show."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2171" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是什么？”她问道，“瞧！这是蓝宝石……啊！真的，就是这条项链。你是多么可爱！……喂，亲爱的，你相信就是我看见的那一条吗？把它摆在橱窗里，更好看。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2172');"><p>That was all the thanks he got, and she let him go away. He noticed Satin stretched out silent and expectant, and with that he gazed at both women and without further insistence submitted to his fate and went downstairs. The hall door had not yet closed when Satin caught Nana round the waist and danced and sang. Then she ran to the window.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2172" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这就算她对他的全部答谢，她还是让他走了。他看见萨丹躺在那儿，在静静地等待着。于是他瞧瞧两个女人，只好听从，不再坚持留下来了，他走下楼去。前厅的门还没有关上，萨丹就一下子搂住娜娜的腰，一股劲儿跳呀，唱呀。随后，她跑到窗口，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2173');"><p>"Oh, just look at the figure he cuts down in the street!" The two women leaned upon the wrought-iron window rail in the shadow of the curtains. One o'clock struck. The Avenue de Villiers was deserted, and its double file of gas lamps stretched away into the darkness of the damp March night through which great gusts of wind kept sweeping, laden with rain. There were vague stretches of land on either side of the road which looked like gulfs of shadow, while scaffoldings round mansions in process of construction loomed upward under the dark sky. They laughed uncontrollably as they watched Muffat's rounded back and glistening shadow disappearing along the wet sidewalk into the glacial, desolate plains of new Paris. But Nana silenced Satin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2173" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“瞧他走在人行道的那副样子！”两个女人在窗帘的遮掩下，把胳膊肘支在铁栏杆上。一点钟敲响了。维里埃大街上空荡荡的，在这三月的潮湿的夜色中，两排煤气街灯延伸到远处，狂风夹着雨扑打在煤气灯上。一块块空地上，看上去犹如一个个黑魆魆的洞穴，正在建筑中的公馆的脚手架耸立在漆黑的夜空中。缪法弓着背，沿着潮湿的人行道走着，他穿过巴黎这片新开辟的冰冷、空荡荡的平地，向前走去，连他的身影仿佛都充满忧伤。她俩见他那副狼狈相，失声大笑起来。这时娜娜叫萨丹住口： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2174');"><p>"Take care; there are the police!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2174" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“注意，警察来了！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2175');"><p>Thereupon they smothered their laughter and gazed in secret fear at two dark figures walking with measured tread on the opposite side of the avenue. Amid all her luxurious surroundings, amid all the royal splendors of the woman whom all must obey, Nana still stood in horror of the police and did not like to hear them mentioned any oftener than death. She felt distinctly unwell when a policeman looked up at her house. One never knew what such people might do! They might easily take them for loose women if they heard them laughing at that hour of the night. Satin, with a little shudder, had squeezed herself up against Nana. Nevertheless, the pair stayed where they were and were soon interested in the approach of a lantern, the light of which danced over the puddles in the road. It was an old ragpicker woman who was busy raking in the gutters. Satin recognized her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2175" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是她们压低了笑声，心里隐约感到恐惧，瞧着马路对面迈着整齐步伐走过来的两个黑影。娜娜虽然过着豪华的生活，像女王一样受人尊敬，但对警察还是怕得要命，不喜欢听人谈到警察，就像不喜欢听人谈到死亡一样。看见一个警察抬头瞧瞧她的公馆，她心里就发慌。谁也不知道这些人会怎样对待她。如果他们听见她们在夜间这个时分狂笑，就很可能把她们当成妓女。萨丹把身子紧紧贴在娜娜身上，微微打着寒战。然而，她们仍然呆在窗口，被一盏渐渐靠近她们的提灯吸引住了，那盏灯光在马路旁的一片片水洼中摇晃着。原来是一个捡破烂的老妪在水洼中捡东西。萨丹认出她来了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2176');"><p>"Dear me," she exclaimed, "it's Queen Pomare with her wickerwork shawl!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2176" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎哟，”萨丹说，“原来是波玛蕾王后，她围一条柳条开司米围巾。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2177');"><p>And while a gust of wind lashed the fine rain in their faces she told her beloved the story of Queen Pomare. Oh, she had been a splendid girl once upon a time: all Paris had talked of her beauty. And such devilish go and such cheek! Why, she led the men about like dogs, and great people stood blubbering on her stairs! Now she was in the habit of getting tipsy, and the women round about would make her drink absinthe for the sake of a laugh, after which the street boys would throw stones at her and chase her. In fact, it was a regular smashup; the queen had tumbled into the mud! Nana listened, feeling cold all over.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2177" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，一阵风夹着毛毛细雨，打在她们脸上，萨丹向娜娜讲述了波玛蕾王后的身世。哦，过去她是一个美丽无比的妓女，她的花容月貌，巴黎无人不夸；她富有魅力，又有胆量，男人像牲口一样听她使唤，一些大人物还在她的楼梯上哭泣呢！如今她酗酒，同区的女人们为了逗趣，总灌她苦艾酒；她酒后走在街上，顽童们跟在她后边向她扔石块。总之，她真正是一落千丈，一个王后跌到粪堆里了！娜娜听着，浑身都凉了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2178');"><p>"You shall see," added Satin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2178" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“让你看看吧。”萨丹说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2179');"><p>She whistled a man's whistle, and the ragpicker, who was then below the window, lifted her head and showed herself by the yellow flare of her lantern. Framed among rags, a perfect bundle of them, a face looked out from under a tattered kerchief—a blue, seamed face with a toothless, cavernous mouth and fiery bruises where the eyes should be. And Nana, seeing the frightful old woman, the wanton drowned in drink, had a sudden fit of recollection and saw far back amid the shadows of consciousness the vision of Chamont—Irma d'Anglars, the old harlot crowned with years and honors, ascending the steps in front of her chateau amid abjectly reverential villagers. Then as Satin whistled again, making game of the old hag, who could not see her:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2179" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她像男人那样吹了一下口哨。那个捡破烂的女人到了窗户下面，她抬起头向上看，在她的提灯的微弱昏黄光亮下，她被看得清楚了。她浑身衣衫褴褛，颈上的围巾已经破成碎片，面色发青，脸上布满伤痕，牙齿都脱落了，嘴像一个空洞，两只眼睛红红的，还有伤痕。娜娜面对这个沉湎于酒的可怕的老妓女，倏然产生一个回忆，在黑暗中，她仿佛看见了夏蒙古堡，仿佛看见了伊尔玛，当昂格拉斯这个年高德劭的妓女，正踏在古堡的台阶上，全村居民都俯伏在她的脚下。萨丹又吹起口哨，嘲笑那个没有看见她的老妪。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2180');"><p>"Do leave off; there are the police!" she murmured in changed tones. "In with us, quick, my pet!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2180" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别吹了，警察来了！”娜娜低声说道，她吓得嗓音都变了。 “快回到屋里来吧，我的小猫咪。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2181');"><p>The measured steps were returning, and they shut the window. Turning round again, shivering, and with the damp of night on her hair, Nana was momentarily astounded at sight of her drawing room. It seemed as though she had forgotten it and were entering an unknown chamber. So warm, so full of perfume, was the air she encountered that she experienced a sense of delighted surprise. The heaped-up wealth of the place, the Old World furniture, the fabrics of silk and gold, the ivory, the bronzes, were slumbering in the rosy light of the lamps, while from the whole of the silent house a rich feeling of great luxury ascended, the luxury of the solemn reception rooms, of the comfortable, ample dining room, of the vast retired staircase, with their soft carpets and seats. Her individuality, with its longing for domination and enjoyment and its desire to possess everything that she might destroy everything, was suddenly increased. Never before had she felt so profoundly the puissance of her sex. She gazed slowly round and remarked with an expression of grave philosophy:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2181" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>警察又迈着整齐的步伐回来了。她们把窗户关好。娜娜回过头来，浑身打着哆嗦，头发湿漉漉的，在客厅前愣了一阵，仿佛忘记了这是她的客厅，好像到了一个陌生的地方。她感到那里的空气那么温暖，那么芳香，顿时感到很幸福。这里堆满了财富，古色古香的家具，金丝绸料，象牙，青铜器，这一切都在粉红色的灯光下沉睡着；幽静的整座公馆给人以无比豪华的感觉，会客厅庄严肃穆，饭厅宽敞舒适，楼梯宽阔宁静，地毯和座椅舒适而雅致。这一切是她自身的倏然扩大，是她的主宰和享受欲望的膨胀，是她的占有一切进而毁掉一切的欲望的膨胀。她从来没有这样深刻地感觉到她的性的威力。她举目慢悠悠地环顾四周，用哲学家的严肃神态说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2182');"><p>"Ah well, all the same, one's jolly well right to profit by things when one's young!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2182" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对呀！一个人年轻时及时行乐还是对的！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2183');"><p>But now Satin was rolling on the bearskins in the bedroom and calling her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2183" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，萨丹躺在卧室的熊皮上打滚，一边呼唤她： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2184');"><p>"Oh, do come! Do come!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2184" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“快来呀！快来呀！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2185');"><p>Nana undressed in the dressing room, and in order to be quicker about it she took her thick fell of blonde hair in both hands and began shaking it above the silver wash hand basin, while a downward hail of long hairpins rang a little chime on the shining metal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2185" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜在梳妆室里脱衣服。为了快点到达萨丹身边，就用手抓住她那厚厚的金发，在银盆上面抖动，长长的发夹像冰雹似地落在发亮的银盆子上，发出一阵清脆悦耳的响声。
