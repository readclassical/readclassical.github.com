</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6067');"><p>The scent of hot bread drifting from the shops along the Street of Flour was sweeter than any perfume Arya had ever smelled. She took a deep breath and stepped closer to the pigeon. It was a plump one, speckled brown, busily pecking at a crust that had fallen between two cobblestones, but when Arya’s shadow touched it, it took to the air.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6067" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从面粉街沿路店铺传出的热面包气味，比艾莉亚闻过的任何一种香水都要诱人。她深吸一口气，朝鸽子又靠近一步。这是只肥鸽，身上长满褐斑，正忙着啄食地上鹅卵石缝隙间的面包屑。然而艾莉亚的影子一碰到它，它便拍翅飞起。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6068');"><p>Her stick sword whistled out and caught it two feet off the ground, and it went down in a flurry of brown feathers. She was on it in the blink of an eye, grabbing a wing as the pigeon flapped and fluttered. It pecked at her hand. She grabbed its neck and twisted until she felt the bone snap.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6068" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的木剑咻地一声窜出，在离地两尺的半空中击中鸟儿，随后它便伴着一堆棕羽毛掉落地面。只一眨眼功夫，她便冲到鸽子旁边，抓住它一只翅膀。鸽子拼命振翅欲飞，还啄她的手。但她抓住它的脖子用力一扭，直到感觉骨头断裂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6069');"><p>Compared with catching cats, pigeons were easy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6069" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>与抓猫相比，捕鸽子实在简单。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6070');"><p>A passing septon was looking at her askance. "Here’s the best place to find pigeon," Arya told him as she brushed herself off and picked up her fallen stick sword. "They come for the crumbs." He hurried away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6070" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一位路过的修士疑惑地看着她。“这里是抓鸽子最好的地方，”艾莉亚一边拍拍身子，拾起掉落的木剑，一边向他解释，“因为它们会来吃面包屑。”听罢此言，他急急忙忙地离开。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6071');"><p>She tied the pigeon to her belt and started down the street. A man was pushing a load of tarts by on a two-wheeled cart; the smells sang of blueberries and lemons and apricots. Her stomach made a hollow rumbly noise. "Could I have one?" she heard herself say. "A lemon, or?.?.?.?or any kind."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6071" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她把鸽子绑在皮带上，沿着街走下去。一名男子推着一辆两轮车，上面满满地放着果酱甜饼，散发出蓝莓、柠檬和杏子的香气。她的空腹咕噜作响。“可以给我一个么?”她听见自己说， “柠檬，或是……或是什么口味都好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6072');"><p>The pushcart man looked her up and down. Plainly he did not like what he saw. "Three coppers."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6072" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>推车的男子上下打量她，显然不太喜欢眼前的光景。“三个铜板。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6073');"><p>Arya tapped her wooden sword against the side of her boot. "I’ll trade you a fat pigeon," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6073" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚用木剑敲敲靴边。“我用一只肥鸽跟你换，”她说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6074');"><p>"The Others take your pigeon," the pushcart man said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6074" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“异鬼才要你的鸽子呢。”推车男子道。• 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6075');"><p>The tarts were still warm from the oven. The smells were making her mouth water, but she did not have three coppers?.?.?.?or one. She gave the pushcart man a look, remembering what Syrio had told her about seeing. He was short, with a little round belly, and when he moved he seemed to favor his left leg a little. She was just thinking that if she snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch her when he said, "You be keepin’ your filthy hands off. The gold cloaks know how to deal with thieving little gutter rats, that they do."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6075" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>刚出炉的果酱饼热腾腾的，香味馋得她直流口水，但她没有三枚铜板……连一个都没有。她看了推车男子一眼，想起西利欧教导她“洞察真相”。他生得很矮，挺着圆圆的小腹，走路时似乎重心偏左。她正在思考假如自己抓了一块饼拔腿就跑，他应该追不上时，只听他说：“把你的脏手给我拿开。你瞧，金袍子知道怎么对付小扒手。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6076');"><p>Arya glanced warily behind her. Two of the City Watch were standing at the mouth of an alley. Their cloaks hung almost to the ground, the heavy wool dyed a rich gold; their mail and boots and gloves were black. One wore a longsword at his hip, the other an iron cudgel. With a last wistful glance at the tarts, Arya edged back from the cart and hurried off. The gold cloaks had not been paying her any special attention, but the sight of them tied her stomach in knots. Arya had been staying as far from the castle as she could get, yet even from a distance she could see the heads rotting atop the high red walls. Flocks of crows squabbled noisily over each head, thick as flies. The talk in Flea Bottom was that the gold cloaks had thrown in with the Lannisters, their commander raised to a lord, with lands on the Trident and a seat on the king’s council.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6076" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚满怀戒心地往后看去。两名都城守卫站在巷口，身披金黄色的厚重羊毛披风，几乎垂到地上；他们的护甲、长靴和手套则是黑色。其中一人腰际佩了长剑，另一个则拿了根铁棍。艾莉亚依依不舍地看了果酱饼最后一眼，转身跑开。金袍卫士虽没特别注意她，可她一看到他们就浑身不对劲。这段时间以来，艾莉亚尽可能地远离城堡，然而即使离得很远，她依旧能看见高高的红墙上腐烂的人头，每颗头上都有大群乌鸦盘旋乱叫，多得像垃圾堆里的苍蝇。跳蚤窟里传言，金袍卫士和兰尼斯特家狼狈为奸，他们的指挥宫因而跻身贵族之列，不仅获得了三叉戟河附近的封地，还成了国王的重臣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6077');"><p>She had also heard other things, scary things, things that made no sense to her. Some said her father had murdered King Robert and been slain in turn by Lord Renly. Others insisted that Renly had killed the king in a drunken quarrel between brothers. Why else should he have fled in the night like a common thief? One story said the king had been killed by a boar while hunting, another that he’d died eating a boar, stuffing himself so full that he’d ruptured at the table. No, the king had died at table, others said, but only because Varys the Spider poisoned him. No, it had been the queen who poisoned him. No, he had died of a pox. No, he had choked on a fish bone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6077" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她也听说了其他的事，吓人的事，把她弄糊涂了。有人说父亲谋害了劳勃国王，之后被蓝礼公爵所杀。有人坚持是两兄弟醉酒发生口角，蓝礼失手把劳勃杀掉的，否则他干嘛大半夜像个小偷似的溜走哩?一种版本的故事宣称国王出外打猎时被一头野猪所杀，另一种版本的故事又说他是吃野猪肉活活撑死。还有人说，不对，国王虽是死在餐桌上，却是因为八爪蜘蛛瓦里斯给他下了毒。不对，毒害他的是王后。不对，他是生疹子死的。不对，他是给鱼骨头噎死的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6078');"><p>One thing all the stories agreed on: King Robert was dead. The bells in the seven towers of the Great Sept of Baelor had tolled for a day and a night, the thunder of their grief rolling across the city in a bronze tide. They only rang the bells like that for the death of a king, a tanner’s boy told Arya.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6078" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>所有故事只有一个共通之处：劳勃国王死了。贝勒大圣堂的七座钟塔响彻日夜，哀悼的鸣动如雷般朝众人滚滚袭来。一位皮匠学徒告诉艾莉亚，只有国王驾崩时，他们才会这样敲钟。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6079');"><p>All she wanted was to go home, but leaving King’s Landing was not so easy as she had hoped. Talk of war was on every lip, and gold cloaks were as thick on the city walls as fleas on?.?.?.?well, her, for one. She had been sleeping in Flea Bottom, on rooftops and in stables, wherever she could find a place to lie down, and it hadn’t taken her long to learn that the district was well named.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6079" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她只想回家，但离开君临远不如她想像的那么容易。每个人都在谈论战争，而城墙上的金袍卫士之多，就好像……好像她身上的跳蚤一样。这段时间，她都睡在跳蚤窝，不管屋顶、马厩，只要能躺下来的地方就行。没过多久，她发现这街区的名字取得真是恰当。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6080');"><p>Every day since her escape from the Red Keep, Arya had visited each of the seven city gates in turn. The Dragon Gate, the Lion Gate, and the Old Gate were closed and barred. The Mud Gate and the Gate of the Gods were open, but only to those who wanted to enter the city; the guards let no one out. Those who were allowed to leave left by the King’s Gate or the Iron Gate, but Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms manned the guard posts there. Spying down from the roof of an inn by the King’s Gate, Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages, forcing riders to open their saddlebags, and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6080" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>自从逃出红堡后，她每天都会到七座城门各绕一辫。巨龙门、雄狮门和旧城门都已紧紧关闭』口上门闩。烂泥门和诸神门虽然还开着，但金袍卫士把守严密，只进不出。获准离开的人走的是国王门和钢铁门，但这两道门由身穿鲜红披风，头顶雄狮头盔的兰尼斯特部队亲自守卫。艾莉亚曾趴在国王门附近的一家旅店屋顶上，眺望过去，只见他们搜索马车货物，强迫骑者打开鞍袋，详加盘查每位徒步出城的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6081');"><p>Sometimes she thought about swimming the river, but the Blackwater Rush was wide and deep, and everyone agreed that its currents were wicked and treacherous. She had no coin to pay a ferryman or take passage on a ship.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6081" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她也想过游泳渡河，但黑水河既宽且深，而每个人都知道里面的暗流汹涌莫测。要搭船，她又没钱付给船夫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6082');"><p>Her lord father had taught her never to steal, but it was growing harder to remember why. If she did not get out soon, she would have to take her chances with the gold cloaks. She hadn’t gone hungry much since she learned to knock down birds with her stick sword, but she feared so much pigeon was making her sick. A couple she’d eaten raw, before she found Flea Bottom.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6082" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲大人教导她绝不能偷东西，可到底为什么不能偷，她是越来越模糊了。眼下她再不赶紧出城，迟早会被金袍子找上。虽然自从她学会用木剑打乌，肚子就很少挨饿，但天天吃鸽子肉，她已经有些反胃。在找到跳蚤窝以前，有两次她还是生吃的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6083');"><p>In the Bottom there were pot-shops along the alleys where huge tubs of stew had been simmering for years, and you could trade half your bird for a heel of yesterday’s bread and a "bowl o’ brown," and they’d even stick the other half in the fire and crisp it up for you, so long as you plucked the feathers yourself. Arya would have given anything for a cup of milk and a lemon cake, but the brown wasn’t so bad. It usually had barley in it, and chunks of carrot and onion and turnip, and sometimes even apple, with a film of grease swimming on top. Mostly she tried not to think about the meat. Once she had gotten a piece of fish.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6083" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>跳蚤窝的巷子里，有许多煮着大锅浓汤，终年冒烟的食堂。你可以用半只鸟跟他们换一点昨天的面包和一碗“褐汤”，假如你肯自己拔毛，他们还愿意帮你把另外半只鸟烤得香香脆脆。艾莉亚愿以任何代价换取一杯牛奶和一块柠檬蛋糕，但“褐汤”其实也不坏。浓汤表面浮着一层油，里面通常有大麦、胡萝卜块、洋葱和芜菁，有时还有苹果。她已经学会了不去幻想肉的味道。只有一次，她在汤里吃到一片鱼肉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6084');"><p>The only thing was, the pot-shops were never empty, and even as she bolted down her food, Arya could feel them watching. Some of them stared at her boots or her cloak, and she knew what they were thinking. With others, she could almost feel their eyes crawling under her leathers; she didn’t know what they were thinking, and that scared her even more. A couple times, she was followed out into the alleys and chased, but so far no one had been able to catch her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6084" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>惟一的麻烦是，这些食堂永远挤满了人，每当艾莉亚狼吞虎咽时，总觉得他们盯着她看。他们瞪着她的靴子和斗篷，她很清楚对方在想些什么。还有些人的目光，让她感觉好像在她的皮衣下面爬，她不明白这些人在想什么，反而更加害怕。更有几次她遭人跟踪，在暗巷里没命奔逃，好在到目前为止，没人抓得到她。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6085');"><p>The silver bracelet she’d hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the castle, along with her bundle of good clothes, snatched while she slept in a burnt-out house off Pig Alley. All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled in, the leathers on her back, her wooden practice sword?.?.?.?and Needle. She’d been lying on top of Needle, or else it would have been gone too; it was worth more than all the rest together. Since then Arya had taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm, to conceal the blade at her hip. The wooden sword she carried in her left hand, out where everybody could see it, to scare off robbers, but there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn’t have been scared off if she’d had a battle-axe. It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread. Often as not, she went to bed hungry rather than risk the stares.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6085" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她原本打算变卖换钱的银手镯，早在离开城堡的第一天晚上就被偷了。当晚她睡在猪巷一间烧毁的屋子里，手镯和那包贵重衣物就在熟睡中不翼而飞，只剩裹在身上的披风，穿着的皮衣和那把练习木剑……以及“缝衣针”。她躺在缝衣针上，否则它肯定也会被偷走，它可比其他东西加起来还要宝贵呢。从那之后，艾莉亚走路时便习惯让斗篷盖住右手，用以遮掩佩在腰际的宝剑。她把木剑拿在左手，让所有人都看得到，用以吓唬强盗——只可惜食堂里有些人，就算她拿着一柄战斧，恐怕也无所谓。看到这些人，足以让她对鸽子肉和硬面包的胃口全失。所以有时候她宁可空着肚子睡觉，也不愿冒险被这些人注意。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6086');"><p>Once she was outside the city, she would find berries to pick, or orchards she might raid for apples and cherries. Arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south. And she could dig for roots in the forest, even run down some rabbits. In the city, the only things to run down were rats and cats and scrawny dogs. The potshops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups, she’d heard, but she didn’t like to think about that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6086" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一旦出城，她便可采野莓吃，或找个果园偷摘苹果和樱桃。艾莉亚记得南下途中曾看到好多园子。再不济，她还可以在森林里挖草根，甚至抓兔子吃。城里会跑的动物，只有老鼠、猫和瘦狗。听说一窝小狗可以在食堂换得一把铜板，但她想想就觉得不安。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6087');"><p>Down below the Street of Flour was a maze of twisting alleys and cross streets. Arya scrambled through the crowds, trying to put distance between her and the gold cloaks. She had learned to keep to the center of the street. Sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses, but at least you could see them coming. If you walked near the buildings, people grabbed you. In some alleys you couldn’t help but brush against the walls; the buildings leaned in so close they almost met.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6087" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>面粉街下的巷道错综复杂，有如迷宫，艾莉亚在人群里推挤，拉开和金袍卫士之间的距离。她已经学会走在道路中央，虽然免不了时时闪躲车辆和马匹，但至少可以看清来者是谁。假如你走得太靠近建筑物，很容易被人一把攫住。可惜在某些巷子里，你不得不贴墙走：建筑物之间距离太近，几乎彼此相连。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6088');"><p>A whooping gang of small children went running past, chasing a rolling hoop. Arya stared at them with resentment, remembering the times she’d played at hoops with Bran and Jon and their baby brother Rickon. She wondered how big Rickon had grown, and whether Bran was sad. She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call her "little sister" and muss her hair. Not that it needed mussing. She’d seen her reflection in puddles, and she didn’t think hair got any more mussed than hers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6088" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一群孩童大呼小叫地跑过身边，追着一个滚动的铁环。艾莉亚怨恨地瞪着他们，想起以前和布兰、琼恩以及小瑞肯玩滚铁环的时光。她不知现在瑞肯长大了多少，也不知布兰是否伤心难过。她愿意付出任何代价，只要琼恩能在她身边，叫她“我的小妹”，弄乱她的头发。其实她的头发已经够乱了，之前她在路上的积水坑中看见自己的倒影，只觉这是全天下最脏的头发。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6089');"><p>She had tried talking to the children she saw in the street, hoping to make a friend who would give her a place to sleep, but she must have talked wrong or something. The little ones only looked at her with quick, wary eyes and ran away if she came too close. Their big brothers and sisters asked questions Arya couldn’t answer, called her names, and tried to steal from her. Only yesterday, a scrawny barefoot girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet, but Arya gave her a crack on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6089" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她曾试着和街上的小孩说话，看能不能交个朋友，让她有地方睡。可能是她说错话了吧，年纪小的孩子只是充满戒心，飞快地瞧她一眼，如果她靠近，便立刻跑开。而他们的大哥大姐则会问些艾莉亚回答不出的问题，给她取难听的绰号，甚至偷她的东西。昨天，便有个打着赤脚，骨瘦如柴，年纪足足是她两倍的女孩把她打倒在地，企图扯下她的那双靴子。艾莉亚拿起木剑，喀地一声打中对方耳朵，令她抽抽噎噎地流着血跑走了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6090');"><p>A gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom. Arya glanced at it thoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of her stick. It made her think of the sea. Maybe that was the way out. Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures. Maybe Arya could do that too. She decided to visit the riverfront. It was on the way to the Mud Gate anyway, and she hadn’t checked that one today.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6090" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她走下雷妮丝丘陵的缓坡，朝跳蚤窝走去。一只海鸥飞过头顶，艾莉亚若有所思地看着它，可它超出木剑攻击范围太远。看到海鸥，不禁让她想起海洋，说不定这正是逃走的办法。老奶妈以前常说一个故事，有位小男孩躲在商船货舱里逃走，结果遇上各式各样的精彩冒险，或许艾莉亚也行哩。于是她决定去河边看看，反正会路过烂泥门，而她今天还没去那儿呢。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6091');"><p>The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there. She spied another pair of gold cloaks, walking side by side through the fish market, but they never so much as looked at her. Half the stalls were empty, and it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered. Out on the Blackwater, three of the king’s war galleys moved in formation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and fell. Arya watched them for a bit, then began to make her way along the river.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6091" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚抵达码头时，周围静得出奇。她瞥见两个金袍卫士，正并排穿过鱼市，可他们看都没看她一眼。市场的摊贩空了一半，港口的船只也比她记忆中少。黑水河上，三艘国王的战船排成固定阵形巡逻，船桨起起落落，金色的船壳破浪前进。艾莉亚看了一会儿，然后开始沿河走。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6092');"><p>When she saw the guardsmen on the third pier, in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin, her heart almost stopped in her chest. The sight of Winterfell’s colors brought tears to her eyes. Behind them, a sleek three-banked trading galley rocked at her moorings. Arya could not read the name painted on the hull; the words were strange, Myrish, Braavosi, perhaps even High Valyrian. She grabbed a passing longshoreman by the sleeve. "Please," she said, "what ship is this?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6092" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当她看见站在三号码头边，身穿灰色羊毛滚白缎披风的卫士时，她的心几乎停止了跳动。临冬城的颜色，她的眼泪不禁夺眶而出。在他们身后，有一条漂亮的三桅商船，泊在码头里轻轻摆动。艾莉亚看不懂船壳上漆的字，那是种奇怪的语言，可能是密尔语、布拉佛斯语甚至高等瓦雷利亚语。她抓住一个路过的码头工的袖子。“请问，”她说，“这艘船是?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6093');"><p>"She’s the Wind Witch, out of Myr," the man said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6093" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“密尔来的‘风之巫女’号。”那人说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6094');"><p>"She’s still here," Arya blurted. The longshoreman gave her a queer look, shrugged, and walked away. Arya ran toward the pier. The Wind Witch was the ship Father had hired to take her home?.?.?.?still waiting! She’d imagined it had sailed ages ago.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6094" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“它还在这儿啊。”艾莉亚脱口便道。码头工人神情怪异地看了她一眼，耸耸肩走了。艾莉亚朝码头跑去。风之巫女号正是父亲雇来送她回家的……它竟然还在这儿!她以为船早就开走了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6095');"><p>Two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds, his hand on the pommel of his sword. Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby, she stopped to rub at her eyes. Her eyes her eyes her eyes, why did?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6095" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>三个守卫之中，两个在赌骰子，另一个则手按剑柄来回巡视。她不能像个小婴儿一样哭哭啼啼地走过去，给他们见着了准会丢脸，于是她停下来揉揉眼睛。眼睛，眼睛，眼睛，他们为什么还……

</p></origin><translate id="div_6097" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚仔细看去。她认得父亲所有的侍卫，但这三个穿灰披风的人她从没见过。“喂，”正在巡逻的那人叫道，“小子，你干什么?”玩骰子的两人抬起头来。

</p></origin><translate id="div_6098" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚用尽浑身解数，才忍住惶恐，没有拔腿就跑。她知道自己若真跑了，他们会立刻追上。于是她逼自己走得更近。他们要找的是个女孩，但他把她错当成小男生了。既然如此，她就当个小男生吧。“要不要买鸽子啊? ”她把死鸟拿给他看。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6101');"><p>She could not have said how she got back to Flea Bottom, but she was breathing hard by the time she reached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between the hills. The Bottom had a stench to it, a stink of pigsties and stables and tanner’s sheds, mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap whorehouses. Arya wound her way through the maze dully. It was not until she caught a whiff of bubbling brown coming through a pot-shop door that she realized her pigeon was gone. It must have slipped from her belt as she ran, or someone had stolen it and she’d never noticed. For a moment she wanted to cry again. She’d have to walk all the way back to the Street of Flour to find another one that plump.

His queen mother stood beside him in a black mourning gown slashed with crimson, a veil of black diamonds in her hair. Arya recognized the Hound, wearing a snowy white cloak over his dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around him. She saw Varys the eunuch gliding among the lords in soft slippers and a patterned damask robe, and she thought the short man with the silvery cape and pointed beard might be the one who had once fought a duel for Mother.

As he lifted the blade above his head, sunlight seemed to ripple and dance down the dark metal, glinting off an edge sharper than any razor. Ice, she thought, he has Ice! Her tears streamed down her face, blinding her.

Arya was wrenched off her feet. She would have fallen if he hadn’t held her up, as easy as if she were a doll. A face pressed close to hers, long black hair and tangled beard and rotten teeth. "Don’t look!" a thick voice snarled at her.
