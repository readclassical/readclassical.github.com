</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5617');"><p>When the battle was done, Dany rode her silver through the fields of the dead. Her handmaids and the men of her khas came after, smiling and jesting among themselves.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5617" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>战事结束之后，丹妮骑着银马穿过辫野横尸，女仆和卡斯部众紧随其后，彼此嬉笑玩闹。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5618');"><p>Dothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the rye and lentils into the ground, while arakhs and arrows had sown a terrible new crop and watered it with blood. Dying horses lifted their heads and screamed at her as she rode past. Wounded men moaned and prayed. Jaqqa rhan moved among them, the mercy men with their heavy axes, taking a harvest of heads from the dead and dying alike. After them would scurry a flock of small girls, pulling arrows from the corpses to fill their baskets. Last of all the dogs would come sniffing, lean and hungry, the feral pack that was never far behind the khalasar.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5618" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大地为多斯拉克铁蹄撕裂，裸麦和扁豆都被踩进泥土，插在地上的亚拉克弯刀和箭支经过鲜血浇灌，成了新的可怕作物。她骑马走过战场，濒死的马儿抬头对她嘶鸣，伤者有的呻吟、有的祈祷。大批拿着重斧，专替伤者解脱的“贾卡朗”穿梭其间，从亡者和将死之人身上收割下数不清的人头。跑在他们后面的是一群小女孩，她们从尸体上拔取箭枝，装进提篮，以备再次使用。最后则是削瘦饥饿但凶猛的狗群，它们闻闻嗅嗅，永远跟随卡拉萨。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5619');"><p>The sheep had been dead longest. There seemed to be thousands of them, black with flies, arrow shafts bristling from each carcass. Khal Ogo’s riders had done that, Dany knew; no man of Drogo’s khalasar would be such a fool as to waste his arrows on sheep when there were shepherds yet to kill.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5619" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>羊群最早死去，似乎有几千只之多，它们身上插满了箭，羽毛竖立在尸体之上。丹妮知道这一定是奥戈卡奥的的部队干的；卓戈的卡拉萨绝不会如此愚蠢，在没杀掉牧羊人之前，就把箭浪费在羊身上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5620');"><p>The town was afire, black plumes of smoke roiling and tumbling as they rose into a hard blue sky. Beneath broken walls of dried mud, riders galloped back and forth, swinging their long whips as they herded the survivors from the smoking rubble. The women and children of Ogo’s khalasar walked with a sullen pride, even in defeat and bondage; they were slaves now, but they seemed not to fear it. It was different with the townsfolk. Dany pitied them; she remembered what terror felt like. Mothers stumbled along with blank, dead faces, pulling sobbing children by the hand. There were only a few men among them, cripples and cowards and grandfathers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5620" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>城镇起火燃烧，缕缕黑烟腾涌翻滚，直上湛蓝的天空。在倾颓的干泥土墙下，骑马战士往来奔驰，挥舞手中长鞭，驱策生还者离开冒烟的废墟。奥戈卡拉萨的女人和小孩即便战败、即使被人奴役，走起路来依旧有种愠怒的自尊；他们如今沦为奴隶，却似乎勇敢地接受自己的命运。当地镇民就不一样了。丹妮深深地怜悯他们，她清楚地记得恐惧的滋味。许多母亲面无表情，死气沉沉，步伐踉跄地拉着啜泣不停的孩子。他们之中仅有少数男性，多半是残废、懦夫和祖父辈的老人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5621');"><p>Ser Jorah said the people of this country named themselves the Lhazareen, but the Dothraki called them haesh rakhi, the Lamb Men. Once Dany might have taken them for Dothraki, for they had the same copper skin and almond-shaped eyes. Now they looked alien to her, squat and flat-faced, their black hair cropped unnaturally short. They were herders of sheep and eaters of vegetables, and Khal Drogo said they belonged south of the river bend. The grass of the Dothraki sea was not meant for sheep.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5621" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士曾说，这个地方的人自称拉札林人，但多斯拉克人唤他们作“赫西拉奇”，意思是 “羊人”。若是从前，丹妮可能会把他们错当成多斯拉克人，因为他们同样有着古铜色皮肤和杏仁形的眼睛。但如今他们在她眼中显得殊异：扁脸、粗矮，黑发剪得异常地短。他们牧养羊群，种植作物，卓戈卡奥说他们的活动范围一直在多斯拉克海边沿的大河以南，因为多斯拉克海的草不是给羊吃的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5622');"><p>Dany saw one boy bolt and run for the river. A rider cut him off and turned him, and the others boxed him in, cracking their whips in his face, running him this way and that. One galloped behind him, lashing him across the buttocks until his thighs ran red with blood. Another snared his ankle with a lash and sent him sprawling. Finally, when the boy could only crawl, they grew bored of the sport and put an arrow through his back.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5622" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮看到一个男孩健步奔向河畔，一名骑马战土阻断他的来路，逼他转身，其余的人则把他围在中间，扬鞭抽打他的脸，驱策他四处逃窜。又一名战士快马跑到他背后，不停鞭打他的臀部，直到鲜血染红了他的大腿。还有一人挥鞭勾住他的脚踝，使之扑倒在地。最后，那男孩只能坚持爬行，他们觉得无聊，便一箭舐穿他的背。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5623');"><p>Ser Jorah met her outside the shattered gate. He wore a dark green surcoat over his mail. His gauntlets, greaves, and greathelm were dark grey steel. The Dothraki had mocked him for a coward when he donned his armor, but the knight had spit insults right back in their teeth, tempers had flared, longsword had clashed with arakh, and the rider whose taunts had been loudest had been left behind to bleed to death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5623" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士在崩毁的城门外迎接她。他在盔甲外罩了一件暗绿色罩袍。他的铁手套、护膝和巨盔都是深灰色精钢打造。当他穿上盔甲时，多斯拉克人嘲笑他是胆小鬼，这名骑士立刻骂了回去，双方一言不合，长剑与亚拉克弯刀交击的结果，那个嘲笑最大声的多斯拉克武士被丢在后方，流血至死。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5624');"><p>Ser Jorah lifted the visor of his flat-topped greathelm as he rode up. "Your lord husband awaits you within the town."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5624" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士骑上前来，揭开平顶巨盔的面罩。“您的夫君在镇里等您。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5625');"><p>"Drogo took no harm?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5625" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“卓戈没受伤吧? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5626');"><p>"A few cuts," Ser Jorah answered, "nothing of consequence. He slew two khals this day. Khal Ogo first, and then the son, Fogo, who became khal when Ogo fell. His bloodriders cut the bells from their hair, and now Khal Drogo’s every step rings louder than before."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5626" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有点皮肉伤，”乔拉爵士答道，“不碍事。今天他亲手杀了两个卡奥，先是奥戈卡奥，随后是他的儿子佛戈，因为父亲死后他便成为新的卡奥。卓戈卡奥的血盟卫割下那两人发问的铃铛，如今他走起路来比以前更是响声大作了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5627');"><p>Ogo and his son had shared the high bench with her lord husband at the naming feast where Viserys had been crowned, but that was in Vaes Dothrak, beneath the Mother of Mountains, where every rider was a brother and all quarrels were put aside. It was different out in the grass. Ogo’s khalasar had been attacking the town when Khal Drogo caught him. She wondered what the Lamb Men had thought, when they first saw the dust of their horses from atop those cracked-mud walls. Perhaps a few, the younger and more foolish who still believed that the gods heard the prayers of desperate men, took it for deliverance.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5627" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>韦赛里斯被加冕的那场庆祝命名的宴会上，奥戈父子曾与她的丈夫并肩而坐，把酒言欢。但那是在维斯•多斯拉克，在圣母山的阴影下，在那里，每位草原马民都是手足兄弟，一切纷争都被搁置一边。到了大草原上就不一样了。奥戈的卡拉萨原本正攻击这座城镇，却被卓戈卡奥打了个措手不及。她不知羊人初次从龟裂的泥墙上方，看到卓戈卡拉萨的马匹扬起的烟尘时，心里作何感想。或许有几个年纪较轻、天真愚昧的人当真以为，天上诸神究竟听见了绝望之人的祈求，为他们派来救赎了吧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5628');"><p>Across the road, a girl no older than Dany was sobbing in a high thin voice as a rider shoved her over a pile of corpses, facedown, and thrust himself inside her. Other riders dismounted to take their turns. That was the sort of deliverance the Dothraki brought the Lamb Men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5628" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>道路对面，有个年纪比丹妮大不了多少的女孩，正以高亢尖细的声音啜泣，一名战士将她推倒在一堆尸体上，面孔朝下，当场施暴。其他战士也纷纷下马，轮流享乐。这就是多斯拉克人带给羊人的救赎。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5629');"><p>I am the blood of the dragon, Daenerys Targaryen reminded herself as she turned her face away. She pressed her lips together and hardened her heart and rode on toward the gate.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5629" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我是真龙传人，丹妮莉丝•坦格利安一边转开脸，一边提醒自己。她抿紧嘴唇，硬起心肠，骑马朝城门走去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5630');"><p>"Most of Ogo’s riders fled," Ser Jorah was saying. "Still, there may be as many as ten thousand captives."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5630" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“奥戈的大部分战士都逃了，”乔拉爵士道，“即便如此，仍有一万名左右的俘虏。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5631');"><p>Slaves, Dany thought. Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver’s Bay. She wanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. This is war, this is what it looks like, this is the price of the Iron Throne.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5631" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>是一万名奴隶，丹妮心想。卓戈卡奥将把这些人顺着大河，驱赶到下游奴隶湾的城镇去。她好想哭，但她告诉自己必须坚强。这是战争，战争就是这样，这是为夺回铁王座所必须付出的代价。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5632');"><p>"I’ve told the khal he ought to make for Meereen," Ser Jorah said. "They’ll pay a better price than he’d get from a slaving caravan. Illyrio writes that they had a plague last year, so the brothels are paying double for healthy young girls, and triple for boys under ten. If enough children survive the journey, the gold will buy us all the ships we need, and hire men to sail them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5632" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我建议卡奥去弥林，”乔拉爵士道，“那里开的价比奴隶商队慷慨得多。伊利里 欧信上说，该城去年遭到瘟疫袭击，所以妓院愿付双倍的价钱购买健康的年轻女孩，十岁以下的小男生甚至是三倍的价钱。如果有足够的孩子撑过这趟旅程，所得的金子不但够我们买船，还足以雇水手。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5633');"><p>Behind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending sound, a long sobbing wail that went on and on and on. Dany’s hand clenched hard around the reins, and she turned the silver’s head. "Make them stop," she commanded Ser Jorah.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5633" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>身后，被轮暴的女孩发出令人心碎的声音，那是一声长长的抽噎，无止尽地持续下去。丹妮紧握缰绳，调转马头。“叫他们住手。”她命令乔拉爵士。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5634');"><p>"Khaleesi?" The knight sounded perplexed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5634" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“卡丽熙? ”骑士似乎有些为难。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5635');"><p>"You heard my words," she said. "Stop them." She spoke to her khas in the harsh accents of Dothraki. "Jhogo, Quaro, you will aid Ser Jorah. I want no rape."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5635" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你听到了我的命令。”她说，“叫他们住手。”她改用多斯拉克语对卡斯部众下令，口气尖锐，“乔戈、魁洛，你们协助乔拉爵士，我不要见到强暴发生。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5636');"><p>The warriors exchanged a baffled look.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5636" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两个战士交换着困惑的眼神。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5637');"><p>Jorah Mormont spurred his horse closer. "Princess," he said, "you have a gentle heart, but you do not understand. This is how it has always been. Those men have shed blood for the khal. Now they claim their reward."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5637" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士踢马靠近。“公主殿下，”他说，“您宅心仁厚，但恐怕有所不知，这里习俗向来如此。那些人为了卡奥流血卖命，如今是该他们取得奖赏的时候。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5638');"><p>Across the road, the girl was still crying, her high singsong tongue strange to Dany’s ears. The first man was done with her now, and a second had taken his place.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5638" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>道路对面，女孩仍旧哭泣不止，她那种高亢有如歌唱的语言在丹妮耳中显得异样地陌生。头一个人已经完事，另一个正过来接替。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5639');"><p>"She is a lamb girl," Quaro said in Dothraki. "She is nothing, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor. The Lamb Men lay with sheep, it is known."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5639" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她是个羊女，”魁洛用多斯拉克语说，“卡丽熙，她什么也不是，和我们的战士在一起，是她的荣幸。羊人与羊交合，大家都知道。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5640');"><p>"It is known," her handmaid Irri echoed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5640" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大家都知道。”女仆伊丽应道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5641');"><p>"It is known," agreed Jhogo, astride the tall grey stallion that Drogo had given him. "If her wailing offends your ears, Khaleesi, Jhogo will bring you her tongue." He drew his arakh.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5641" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大家都知道。”乔戈也同意。他骑着卓戈赐给他的那匹高大灰马。“卡丽熙，若她的哭嚎冒犯了您的耳朵，乔戈这就去把她的舌头给您带来。”说完他拔出亚拉克弯刀。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5642');"><p>"I will not have her harmed," Dany said. "I claim her. Do as I command you, or Khal Drogo will know the reason why."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5642" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不要她受伤，”丹妮说，“这女孩我要定了。照我的命令去办，否则卓戈卡奥惟你是问。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5643');"><p>"Ai, Khaleesi," Jhogo replied, kicking his horse. Quaro and the others followed his lead, the bells in their hair chiming.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5643" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“唉，卡丽熙。”乔戈说完一踢马肚，魁洛和其他人也跟着过去，发际铃铛轻声作响。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5644');"><p>"Go with them," she commanded Ser Jorah.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5644" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你也去。”她命令乔拉爵士。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5645');"><p>"As you command." The knight gave her a curious look. "You are your brother’s sister, in truth."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5645" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如您所愿。”骑士眼神古怪地看了她一眼。“你果真是你哥哥的妹妹。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5646');"><p>"Viserys?" She did not understand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5646" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“韦赛里斯?”她不懂。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5647');"><p>"No," he answered. "Rhaegar." He galloped off.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5647" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，”他回答，“雷加。”他策马驰去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5648');"><p>Dany heard Jhogo shout. The rapers laughed at him. One man shouted back. Jhogo’s arakh flashed, and the man’s head went tumbling from his shoulders. Laughter turned to curses as the horsemen reached for weapons, but by then Quaro and Aggo and Rakharo were there. She saw Aggo point across the road to where she sat upon her silver. The riders looked at her with cold black eyes. One spat. The others scattered to their mounts, muttering.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5648" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮听见乔戈大叫。施暴者们嘲笑他，有个人甚至吼了回去。乔戈的亚拉克弯刀一闪，那人的头便从肩膀滚落地面。笑声转为咒骂，那些人纷纷抽出武器，然而这时魁洛、阿戈和拉卡洛也已赶到。她见路那边的阿戈指指骑在银马上的她，那些战士用冰冷的黑眼睛瞪着她，其中一人啐了口唾沫，其他人则回去骑马，嘴里念念有词。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5649');"><p>All the while the man atop the lamb girl continued to plunge in and out of her, so intent on his pleasure that he seemed unaware of what was going on around him. Ser Jorah dismounted and wrenched him off with a mailed hand. The Dothraki went sprawling in the mud, bounced up with a knife in hand, and died with Aggo’s arrow through his throat. Mormont pulled the girl off the pile of corpses and wrapped her in his blood-spattered cloak. He led her across the road to Dany. "What do you want done with her?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5649" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>与此同时，骑在羊女身上的人依旧努力运作，全神贯注于他的享乐，对周遭事物毫无所觉。乔拉爵士下马，伸出戴铁手套的手将他硬生生拧开。那多斯拉克人摔在泥地上，翻身跳起，手握短刀，旋即被阿戈一箭封喉。莫尔蒙将女孩自尸堆上拉起来，解下自己血迹斑斑的披风为之披上，然后领她穿过道路，走到丹妮面前。“您要怎么处置她? ”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5650');"><p>The girl was trembling, her eyes wide and vague. Her hair was matted with blood. "Doreah, see to her hurts. You do not have a rider’s look, perhaps she will not fear you. The rest, with me." She urged the silver through the broken wooden gate.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5650" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>女孩睁大眼睛，神情恍惚，浑身颤抖。她的头发因鲜血而纠结。“多莉亚，把她的伤处理一下。你不是本族的人，或许她不会怕你。其他人，跟我来。”她驱策银马。穿过崩毁的木城门。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5651');"><p>It was worse inside the town. Many of the houses were afire, and the jaqqa rhan had been about their grisly work. Headless corpses filled the narrow, twisty lanes. They passed other women being raped. Each time Dany reined up, sent her khas to make an end to it, and claimed the victim as slave. One of them, a thick-bodied, flat-nosed woman of forty years, blessed Dany haltingly in the Common Tongue, but from the others she got only flat black stares. They were suspicious of her, she realized with sadness; afraid that she had saved them for some worse fate.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5651" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>镇上的情形比外面更惨，无数房舍着火燃烧。“贾卡朗”往返忙碌，进行他们的血腥工作，狭窄曲折的巷道里塞满了无头尸体。途中，他们时时见到女人被强暴，每次丹妮都勒住缰绳，派卡斯部众上前臸止，并收被害者为自己的奴隶。其中一个肥胖、扁鼻、约四十来岁的妇人用生硬的通用语祝福丹妮，但其他人眼中只有怨毒的瞪视。她们怀疑她，她哀伤地明白，害怕她会将她们带往更悲惨的命运。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5652');"><p>"You cannot claim them all, child," Ser Jorah said, the fourth time they stopped, while the warriors of her khas herded her new slaves behind her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5652" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“孩子，你没法把她们通通收为已有的。”当他们第四次停下，看着卡斯部众把新的一批奴隶带到她身后，乔拉爵士忍不住道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5653');"><p>"I am khaleesi, heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the blood of the dragon," Dany reminded him. "It is not for you to tell me what I cannot do." Across the city, a building collapsed in a great gout of fire and smoke, and she heard distant screams and the wailing of frightened children.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5653" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我是卡丽熙，是七大王国的继承人，也是真龙传人。”丹妮提醒他。“你没资格告诉我什么不能做。”城市彼方，一座建筑在烈火和浓烟中轰然倒塌，她听见远处传来尖叫和孩童惊怕的呜咽。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5654');"><p>They found Khal Drogo seated before a square windowless temple with thick mud walls and a bulbous dome like some immense brown onion. Beside him was a pile of heads taller than he was. One of the short arrows of the Lamb Men stuck through the meat of his upper arm, and blood covered the left side of his bare chest like a splash of paint. His three bloodriders were with him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5654" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们找到卓戈时，他正坐在一座无窗的方形神庙前，那庙宇有厚厚的泥墙和球茎状的圆顶，宛如一个巨大的褐色洋葱。在他身边，是一堆人头，叠得比他还高。他的上臂插了一枝羊人的短箭，赤裸的左胸一片血红，像是泼洒了颜料。他的三个血盟卫悉数在场。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5655');"><p>Jhiqui helped Dany dismount; she had grown clumsy as her belly grew larger and heavier. She knelt before the khal. "My sun-and-stars is wounded." The arakh cut was wide but shallow; his left nipple was gone, and a flap of bloody flesh and skin dangled from his chest like a wet rag.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5655" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>姬琪搀扶丹妮下马；随着肚子越来越大，她的躯体越显沉重，行动日渐笨拙。她在卡奥面前跪下。“我的日和星受伤了。”亚拉克弯刀所留的伤口虽然很长，幸而割得不深；他的左边乳头不见踪影，一片血淋淋的皮肉垂在胸前，活如一块湿润的破布。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5656');"><p>"Is scratch, moon of life, from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo," Khal Drogo said in the Common Tongue. "I kill him for it, and Ogo too." He turned his head, the bells in his braid ringing softly. "Is Ogo you hear, and Fogo his khalakka, who was khal when I slew him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5656" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是擦伤，我生命中的月亮，来自奥戈卡奥的血盟卫。”卓戈卡奥说。“为此我杀了他，也杀了奥戈。”他扭扭头，发辪上的铃铛轻声作响。“你听到的是奥戈，还有他的卡拉喀佛戈，当我杀他的时候，他是卡奥。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5657');"><p>"No man can stand before the sun of my life," Dany said, "the father of the stallion who mounts the world."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5657" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“无人能抵挡我生命中的太阳，”丹妮说，“他是骑着世界的骏马之父。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5658');"><p>A mounted warrior rode up and vaulted from his saddle. He spoke to Haggo, a stream of angry Dothraki too fast for Dany to understand. The huge bloodrider gave her a heavy look before he turned to his khal "This one is Mago, who rides in the khas of Ko Jhaqo. He says the khaleesi has taken his spoils, a daughter of the lambs who was his to mount."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5658" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，一名战土骑马而至，翻身下鞍，愤怒地用多斯拉克语对哈戈讲了一大串话，由于速度太快，丹妮听不懂。高大的血盟卫沉重地看了她一眼，这才转向卡奥。“这是马戈，贾科寇叩勺卡斯部众。他说卡丽熙抢走了他的战利晶，一个应该让他骑的羔羊之女。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5659');"><p>Khal Drogo’s face was still and hard, but his black eyes were curious as they went to Dany. "Tell me the truth of this, moon of my life," he commanded in Dothraki.

When she was ready, she broke off the barbed arrowhead and pulled out the shaft, chanting in the singsong tongue of the Lhazareen. She heated a flagon of wine to boiling on the brazier, and poured it over his wounds. Khal Drogo cursed her, but he did not move. She bound the arrow wound with a plaster of wet leaves and turned to the gash on his breast, smearing it with a pale green paste before she pulled the flap of skin back in place. The khal ground his teeth together and swallowed a scream. The godswife took out a silver needle and a bobbin of silk thread and began to close the flesh. When she was done she painted the skin with red ointment, covered it with more leaves, and bound the breast in a ragged piece of lambskin. "You must say the prayers I give you and keep the lambskin in place for ten days and ten nights," she said. "There will be fever, and itching, and a great scar when the healing is done."
