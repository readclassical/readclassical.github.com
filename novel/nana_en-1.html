</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"><p>At nine o'clock in the evening the body of the house at the Theatres des Varietes was still all but empty. A few individuals, it is true, were sitting quietly waiting in the balcony and stalls, but these were lost, as it were, among the ranges of seats whose coverings of cardinal velvet loomed in the subdued light of the dimly burning luster. A shadow enveloped the great red splash of the curtain, and not a sound came from the stage, the unlit footlights, the scattered desks of the orchestra. It was only high overhead in the third gallery, round the domed ceiling where nude females and children flew in heavens which had turned green in the gaslight, that calls and laughter were audible above a continuous hubbub of voices, and heads in women's and workmen's caps were ranged, row above row, under the wide-vaulted bays with their gilt-surrounding adornments. Every few seconds an attendant would make her appearance, bustling along with tickets in her hand and piloting in front of her a gentleman and a lady, who took their seats, he in his evening dress, she sitting slim and undulant beside him while her eyes wandered slowly round the house.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>晚上九点钟了，游艺剧院的演出厅里还是空荡荡的，只有楼厅和正厅前座里，有几个早到的观众在等候开演，在枝形吊灯的昏黄光线下，隐约看见他们坐在紫红丝绒套的座椅里，幕布被笼罩在一片昏暗之中，犹如一大块红色的斑点。舞台上阒然无声，成排的脚灯熄灭了，乐师们的乐谱架摆得七零八落。只有四楼楼座里，发出阵阵喧嚣声，还夹杂着呼唤声和笑声，在金色框架的大圆窗下，坐着一些观众，他们头戴无沿帽或鸭舌帽，在天花板上的圆形拱顶四周，画着一些女人和裸体儿童，在天空中飞翔，天空在煤气灯光照耀下，呈现出一派绿色。不时出现一位女引座员，手里拿着票根，忙着把走在她前边的一位先生和一位太太领到座位上。男的穿着礼服，女的身材颀长，挺着胸脯，他们把目光缓缓向四下扫视。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"><p>Two young men appeared in the stalls; they kept standing and looked about them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>正厅里来了两个年轻人。他们站着，目光环顾四周。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"><p>"Didn't I say so, Hector?" cried the elder of the two, a tall fellow with little black mustaches. "We're too early! You might quite well have allowed me to finish my cigar."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我对你是怎么说的，埃克托尔？”年龄大的青年说道，这个青年高个子，嘴上蓄着小黑胡子，“我们来得太早了，你应该让我把雪茄抽完再来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"><p>An attendant was passing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一个女引座员从他们旁边经过。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"><p>"Oh, Monsieur Fauchery," she said familiarly, "it won't begin for half an hour yet!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哟！原来是福什利先生，”她亲切地说道，“不过半个钟头，戏是不会开演的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"><p>"Then why do they advertise for nine o'clock?" muttered Hector, whose long thin face assumed an expression of vexation. "Only this morning Clarisse, who's in the piece, swore that they'd begin at nine o'clock punctually."
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么，他们贴出的广告上为什么说是九点钟呢？”埃克托尔低声埋怨道，瘦削的脸上露出怒气冲冲的样子，“今天早上，在剧中担任角色的克拉利瑟还向我保证说，八点整就开演呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"><p>For a moment they remained silent and, looking upward, scanned the shadowy boxes. But the green paper with which these were hung rendered them more shadowy still. Down below, under the dress circle, the lower boxes were buried in utter night. In those on the second tier there was only one stout lady, who was stranded, as it were, on the velvet-covered balustrade in front of her. On the right hand and on the left, between lofty pilasters, the stage boxes, bedraped with long-fringed scalloped hangings, remained untenanted. The house with its white and gold, relieved by soft green tones, lay only half disclosed to view, as though full of a fine dust shed from the little jets of flame in the great glass luster.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们沉默了片刻，抬头察看昏暗中的包厢。不过，因为包厢壁上贴的是绿纸，里面显得更加黯淡。往下看，楼下包厢隐没在一片漆黑之中。楼厅包厢里，只有一位胖乎乎的妇女，疲乏地趴在罩丝绒的栏杆上。舞台的左右两侧，高高的柱子之间的包厢里空无一人。包厢外壁上挂着带有长长流苏的垂饰。金色和白色的大厅，衬托着嫩绿色，在水晶大吊灯的微弱灯光照耀下，空中好像弥漫着微尘。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"><p>"Did you get your stage box for Lucy?" asked Hector.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你给吕西买了边包厢票没有？”埃克托尔问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"><p>"Yes," replied his companion, "but I had some trouble to get it. Oh, there's no danger of Lucy coming too early!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“买了，”另一个青年回答道，“不过，买票可不容易啊！哦！别担心，吕西不会来得太早的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"><p>He stifled a slight yawn; then after a pause:
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他轻轻打了一个呵欠，沉默了一会，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"><p>"You're in luck's way, you are, since you haven't been at a first night before. The Blonde Venus will be the event of the year. People have been talking about it for six months. Oh, such music, my dear boy! Such a sly dog, Bordenave! He knows his business and has kept this for the exhibition season." Hector was religiously attentive. He asked a question.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你真走运，你还没有看过首场演出……《金发爱神》的上演将是今年的一件大事，这出戏人们已经谈论半年了。啊！亲爱的，多么动听的音乐！这出戏真吸引人！博尔德纳夫真精明，他把这出戏留到博览会期间才上演。” 埃克托尔认真地听着，他提了一个问题： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"><p>"And Nana, the new star who's going to play Venus, d'you know her?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“娜娜这个新明星，她应该演爱神喽，你认识她吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"><p>"There you are; you're beginning again!" cried Fauchery, casting up his arms. "Ever since this morning people have been dreeing me with Nana. I've met more than twenty people, and it's Nana here and Nana there! What do I know? Am I acquainted with all the light ladies in Paris? Nana is an invention of Bordenave's! It must be a fine one!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“问吧！问得好！还会有人问我！”福什利嚷道，一边把两只胳膊向上一举，“从今天早上起，人们就缠住我，问娜娜的情况。我遇到不下二十个这样的人，问娜娜这样，问娜娜那样！难道我知道吗？难道我认识巴黎的所有风骚娘儿们吗？……娜娜是博尔德纳夫的新发现。她肯定不是什么好东西。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"><p>He calmed himself, but the emptiness of the house, the dim light of the luster, the churchlike sense of self-absorption which the place inspired, full as it was of whispering voices and the sound of doors banging—all these got on his nerves.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，他平静下来。不过，大厅里空荡荡的，分枝吊灯发出的光线昏昏暗暗，一片教堂般的肃穆气氛，窃窃私语声，门开关的声音，这一切都令他烦躁不安。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"><p>"No, by Jove," he said all of a sudden, "one's hair turns gray here. I—I'm going out. Perhaps we shall find Bordenave downstairs. He'll give us information about things."
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！不对，”他突然说道，“在这里呆下去，人会变老的。我就出去……我们到楼下去，也许遇到博尔德纳夫，他会细细跟我们讲的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"><p>Downstairs in the great marble-paved entrance hall, where the box office was, the public were beginning to show themselves. Through the three open gates might have been observed, passing in, the ardent life of the boulevards, which were all astir and aflare under the fine April night. The sound of carriage wheels kept stopping suddenly; carriage doors were noisily shut again, and people began entering in small groups, taking their stand before the ticket bureau and climbing the double flight of stairs at the end of the hall, up which the women loitered with swaying hips. Under the crude gaslight, round the pale, naked walls of the entrance hall, which with its scanty First Empire decorations suggested the peristyle of a toy temple, there was a flaring display of lofty yellow posters bearing the name of "Nana" in great black letters. Gentlemen, who seemed to be glued to the entry, were reading them; others, standing about, were engaged in talk, barring the doors of the house in so doing, while hard by the box office a thickset man with an extensive, close-shaven visage was giving rough answers to such as pressed to engage seats.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>检票处设在楼下铺着大理石的前厅内，观众已经开始入场了。从敞开的三道栅栏门望出去，只见马路上热闹非凡，在这晴朗的四月的夜晚，灯火通明。一辆辆马车在剧院前嘎的一声停下来，打开的车门又砰的一声关上，人们三五成群地进场，在检票处滞留一会儿，然后走到前厅尽头，从左右两边的楼梯上楼，妇女们扭动着腰肢慢腾腾地上楼。前厅里有少许拿破仑时代的装饰，看上去颇像圣殿里纸板做成的列柱廊。光秃秃的灰白墙壁上，贴着黄色巨幅海报，在煤气灯照耀下，显得格外醒目，上面用大黑体字写着娜娜的名字。一些男人经过那里，停下脚步，在那里看海报，另一些男人则站在那里聊天，堵在门口。而在靠近订票处的地方，有一个粗壮男子，宽面颊，胡子刮得光光的，正在粗声粗气地回答一些人的问题，他们恳求他卖票给他们。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"><p>"There's Bordenave," said Fauchery as he came down the stairs. But the manager had already seen him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这就是博尔德纳夫。”福什利一边说，一边下楼梯。 经理已经瞥见了他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"><p>"Ah, ah! You're a nice fellow!" he shouted at him from a distance. "That's the way you give me a notice, is it? Why, I opened my Figaro this morning—never a word!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂！你真够讲交情啊！”经理老远对他大声嚷道，“原来你是这样给我写文章的……今天早上我翻开《费加罗报》一看，连一个字也没有。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"><p>"Wait a bit," replied Fauchery. "I certainly must make the acquaintance of your Nana before talking about her. Besides, I've made no promises."
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“再等等吧！”福什利回答，“在写文章介绍她之前，我得先认识一下你的那位娜娜才行……何况，我什么也没有答应过你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"><p>Then to put an end to the discussion, he introduced his cousin, M. Hector de la Faloise, a young man who had come to finish his education in Paris. The manager took the young man's measure at a glance. But Hector returned his scrutiny with deep interest. This, then, was that Bordenave, that showman of the sex who treated women like a convict overseer, that clever fellow who was always at full steam over some advertising dodge, that shouting, spitting, thigh-slapping fellow, that cynic with the soul of a policeman! Hector was under the impression that he ought to discover some amiable observation for the occasion.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，为了不让经理再缠住他，他就把他的表弟埃克托尔德拉法卢瓦兹介绍给博尔德纳夫。这个青年人是到巴黎来求学的。经理看了青年一眼。埃克托尔却心情激动地打量着经理。原来他就是博尔德纳夫，这个耍女人的人，对待女人像对待狱卒一样。这个人的头脑里总是想着做广告，说起话来嗓门很高，又吐唾沫，又拍大腿，是一个厚颜无耻、专横跋扈的人。埃克托尔觉得对这样的人要说句客套话，恭维恭维他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"><p>"Your theater—" he began in dulcet tones.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您的剧院……”他用轻柔的声音说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"><p>Bordenave interrupted him with a savage phrase, as becomes a man who dotes on frank situations.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>博尔德纳夫是一个喜欢说话开门见山的人，他毫不掩饰地用一句粗俗的话打断了他的话： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"><p>"Call it my brothel!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你尽管叫我的妓院好了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"><p>At this Fauchery laughed approvingly, while La Faloise stopped with his pretty speech strangled in his throat, feeling very much shocked and striving to appear as though he enjoyed the phrase. The manager had dashed off to shake hands with a dramatic critic whose column had considerable influence. When he returned La Faloise was recovering. He was afraid of being treated as a provincial if he showed himself too much nonplused.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，福什利赞同地笑了，而拉法卢瓦兹的恭维话还未说完，堵在喉咙里，他觉得经理的话很刺耳，却竭力装出一副欣赏这句话的样子。这时，经理匆忙走过去与一个戏剧评论家握手，这位评论家的专栏文章在社会上颇有影响。当经理回来时，年轻人心里已经恢复了平静。他怕自己显得过分拘谨，别人会把他看成乡巴佬。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"><p>"I have been told," he began again, longing positively to find something to say, "that Nana has a delicious voice."
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“人家告诉我，”他很想找些话来说说，又说道，“娜娜有个好嗓子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"><p>"Nana?" cried the manager, shrugging his shoulders. "The voice of a squirt!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她呀！”经理耸耸肩膀，大声说道，“她有一副破锣嗓子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"><p>The young man made haste to add:
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>年轻人赶快补充道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"><p>"Besides being a first-rate comedian!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“而且听说她是个出色的演员呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"><p>"She? Why she's a lump! She has no notion what to do with her hands and feet."
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她呀！……简直是一堆肥肉，演戏时连手脚都不知道该怎么放。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"><p>La Faloise blushed a little. He had lost his bearings. He stammered:
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>拉法卢瓦兹脸上微微红了一下，弄得摸不着头脑，结巴道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"><p>"I wouldn't have missed this first representation tonight for the world. I was aware that your theater—"
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“无论如何我也不要错过今晚的首场演出。我早就知道您的剧院了……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"><p>"Call it my brothel," Bordenave again interpolated with the frigid obstinacy of a man convinced.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就叫我的妓院好了。”博尔德纳夫又一次打断他的话，态度冷漠而又固执，像一个非常自信的人。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"><p>Meanwhile Fauchery, with extreme calmness, was looking at the women as they came in. He went to his cousin's rescue when he saw him all at sea and doubtful whether to laugh or to be angry.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时候，福什利一声不吭，他在注视着那些正在入场的妇女。当他发觉他的表弟愣在那儿，被弄得啼笑皆非，就过来给他解围。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"><p>"Do be pleasant to Bordenave—call his theater what he wishes you to, since it amuses him. And you, my dear fellow, don't keep us waiting about for nothing. If your Nana neither sings nor acts you'll find you've made a blunder, that's all. It's what I'm afraid of, if the truth be told."
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你就按照博尔德纳夫的意思叫好了，他叫你怎么叫，你就怎么叫，这样他就高兴了……而你呢，老兄，别让我们在这儿久待了。如果你的娜娜既不会唱又不会演，那么你的戏就一定失败，只会失败。而且，这正是我所担心的事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"><p>"A blunder! A blunder!" shouted the manager, and his face grew purple. "Must a woman know how to act and sing? Oh, my chicken, you're too STOOPID. Nana has other good points, by heaven!—something which is as good as all the other things put together. I've smelled it out; it's deuced pronounced with her, or I've got the scent of an idiot. You'll see, you'll see! She's only got to come on, and all the house will be gaping at her."
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“失败！失败！”经理的脸涨得通红，大声嚷道，“难道一个女人要会演会唱才行？啊！我的小老弟，你也太迂拙了……娜娜有别的长处，这是真的！这个长处抵得上任何长处。我已经觉察出来了，这个长处在她身上很突出，如果我觉察不出来，我就是白痴……你等着瞧吧，你等着瞧吧，只要她一出场，全场观众就会看得垂涎三尺。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"><p>He had held up his big hands which were trembling under the influence of his eager enthusiasm, and now, having relieved his feelings, he lowered his voice and grumbled to himself:
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他兴奋极了，举起两只粗大的手，手都发抖了。接着，他感到很欣慰，低声自语道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"><p>"Yes, she'll go far! Oh yes, s'elp me, she'll go far! A skin—oh, what a skin she's got!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，她前途无量。啊！真见鬼！是的，她前途无量……她是个婊子。啊！她是个婊子！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"><p>Then as Fauchery began questioning him he consented to enter into a detailed explanation, couched in phraseology so crude that Hector de la Faloise felt slightly disgusted. He had been thick with Nana, and he was anxious to start her on the stage. Well, just about that time he was in search of a Venus. He—he never let a woman encumber him for any length of time; he preferred to let the public enjoy the benefit of her forthwith. But there was a deuce of a row going on in his shop, which had been turned topsy-turvy by that big damsel's advent. Rose Mignon, his star, a comic actress of much subtlety and an adorable singer, was daily threatening to leave him in the lurch, for she was furious and guessed the presence of a rival. And as for the bill, good God! What a noise there had been about it all! It had ended by his deciding to print the names of the two actresses in the same-sized type. But it wouldn't do to bother him. Whenever any of his little women, as he called them—Simonne or Clarisse, for instance—wouldn't go the way he wanted her to he just up with his foot and caught her one in the rear. Otherwise life was impossible. Oh yes, he sold 'em; HE knew what they fetched, the wenches!
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>随后，在福什利的诘问下，他便答应把详细情况告诉他。他的言辞粗俗不堪，埃克托尔德拉法卢瓦兹听后，感到很不舒服。他认识娜娜后，就想把她推上舞台。就在这时候，他正好缺少一个人演爱神。他是不会长时间把精力放在一个女人身上的，因此希望让观众很快欣赏到她。不过，这个高个子姑娘的到来，在他的戏班子里引起了一场轩然大波。他原来的明星叫罗丝米尼翁，是一个演技精湛的演员，也是一个受人崇拜的歌星，她感到来了一个竞争对手，心里很恼火，便用甩手不干来威胁他。为了海报上排名的事，天哪！闹得不可开交，最后，他决定把两个人的名字用同样大的字体印在上面。他绝不让别人来惹他麻烦，只要他的小娘儿们棗他是这样称呼她们的棗有一个人，不管是西蒙娜还是克拉利瑟，行动稍有差错，他就朝她们屁股上狠狠踢过去。不这样，他就无法维持生计。他用她们来卖钱，这些婊子，他知道她们的身价！“瞧！”他说完换了话题，“米尼翁和斯泰内来了，他俩总是在一起。你们知道斯泰内对罗丝开始讨厌了，所以，她的丈夫总是寸步不离斯泰内，生怕他溜走。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_41');"><p>"Tut!" he cried, breaking off short. "Mignon and Steiner. Always together. You know, Steiner's getting sick of Rose; that's why the husband dogs his steps now for fear of his slipping away."
</p></origin><translate id="div_41" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>剧院檐口上的一排煤气灯发出夺目的光芒，把人行道照得雪亮。两棵碧绿的小树在灯光照射下显得格外清楚，一根柱子被强烈的灯光照得发亮，人们老远就能看见海报上的字，清楚得和大白天一样；远处街上的暮色越来越浓，星星灯火闪闪发光，马路上行人熙熙攘攘。许多人还没有马上进场，他们滞留在外面，一边聊天，一边抽雪茄。排灯的光线把他们的脸照得灰白，他们缩短了的身影在柏油马路上清晰可见。米尼翁是一个身材高大、宽肩的汉子，长着一个江湖艺人的方形脑袋，他从人群中挤出来，挽着银行家斯泰内的胳膊；斯泰内身材矮小，大腹便便，面孔圆圆的，下颔和两颊上长着一圈灰白络腮胡子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_42');"><p>On the pavement outside, the row of gas jets flaring on the cornice of the theater cast a patch of brilliant light. Two small trees, violently green, stood sharply out against it, and a column gleamed in such vivid illumination that one could read the notices thereon at a distance, as though in broad daylight, while the dense night of the boulevard beyond was dotted with lights above the vague outline of an ever-moving crowd. Many men did not enter the theater at once but stayed outside to talk while finishing their cigars under the rays of the line of gas jets, which shed a sallow pallor on their faces and silhouetted their short black shadows on the asphalt. Mignon, a very tall, very broad fellow, with the square-shaped head of a strong man at a fair, was forcing a passage through the midst of the groups and dragging on his arm the banker Steiner, an exceedingly small man with a corporation already in evidence and a round face framed in a setting of beard which was already growing gray.
</p></origin><translate id="div_42" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么？”博尔德纳夫对银行家说道，“你昨天在我的办公室里已经见到过她。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_43');"><p>"Well," said Bordenave to the banker, "you met her yesterday in my office."
</p></origin><translate id="div_43" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！原来就是她，”斯泰内嚷道，“我料到是她。不过，她进来的时候，我正往外走，我几乎没有看清她。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_44');"><p>"Ah! It was she, was it?" ejaculated Steiner. "I suspected as much. Only I was coming out as she was going in, and I scarcely caught a glimpse of her."
</p></origin><translate id="div_44" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>米尼翁耷拉着眼皮听着，一边使劲转动着手指上的大钻石戒指，他明白了，他们谈的是娜娜。随后，博尔德纳夫把他的新来的明星的模样描绘了一番，银行家的眼里燃起了欲火。米尼翁终于插话道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_45');"><p>Mignon was listening with half-closed eyelids and nervously twisting a great diamond ring round his finger. He had quite understood that Nana was in question. Then as Bordenave was drawing a portrait of his new star, which lit a flame in the eyes of the banker, he ended by joining in the conversation.

In front of them a stream of people was crowding and crushing against the ticket office, and there was a din of voices, in the midst of which the name of Nana sounded with all the melodious vivacity of its two syllables. The men who stood planted in front of the notices kept spelling it out loudly; others, in an interrogative tone, uttered it as they passed; while the women, at once restless and smiling, repeated it softly with an air of surprise. Nobody knew Nana. Whence had Nana fallen? And stories and jokes, whispered from ear to ear, went the round of the crowd. The name was a caress in itself; it was a pet name, the very familiarity of which suited every lip. Merely through enunciating it thus, the throng worked itself into a state of gaiety and became highly good natured. A fever of curiosity urged it forward, that kind of Parisian curiosity which is as violent as an access of positive unreason. Everybody wanted to see Nana. A lady had the flounce of her dress torn off; a man lost his hat.

One of them in blue, the other in rose-pink, they stood blocking the way with their deeply flounced skirts, and Nana's name kept repeating itself so shrilly in their conversation that people began to listen to them. The Count de Vandeuvres carried Blanche off. But by this time Nana's name was echoing more loudly than ever round the four walls of the entrance hall amid yearnings sharpened by delay. Why didn't the play begin? The men pulled out their watches; late-comers sprang from their conveyances before these had fairly drawn up; the groups left the sidewalk, where the passers-by were crossing the now-vacant space of gaslit pavement, craning their necks, as they did so, in order to get a peep into the theater. A street boy came up whistling and planted himself before a notice at the door, then cried out, "Woa, Nana!" in the voice of a tipsy man and hied on his way with a rolling gait and a shuffling of his old boots. A laugh had arisen at this. Gentlemen of unimpeachable appearance repeated: "Nana, woa, Nana!" People were crushing; a dispute arose at the ticket office, and there was a growing clamor caused by the hum of voices calling on Nana, demanding Nana in one of those accesses of silly facetiousness and sheer animalism which pass over mobs.

The rumor reached the boulevard, and thereupon followed a stampede, everyone wanting to pass in, while the servants of the theater increased their forces. Mignon, with an anxious air, at last got hold of Steiner again, the latter not having been to see Rose's costume. At the very first tinkle of the bell La Faloise had cloven a way through the crowd, pulling Fauchery with him, so as not to miss the opening scene. But all this eagerness on the part of the public irritated Lucy Stewart. What brutes were these people to be pushing women like that! She stayed in the rear of them all with Caroline Hequet and her mother. The entrance hall was now empty, while beyond it was still heard the long-drawn rumble of the boulevard.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_66');"><p>In the house Fauchery and La Faloise, in front of their stalls, were gazing about them anew. By this time the house was resplendent. High jets of gas illumined the great glass chandelier with a rustling of yellow and rosy flames, which rained down a stream of brilliant light from dome to floor. The cardinal velvets of the seats were shot with hues of lake, while all the gilding shone again, the soft green decorations chastening its effect beneath the too-decided paintings of the ceiling. The footlights were turned up and with a vivid flood of brilliance lit up the curtain, the heavy purple drapery of which had all the richness befitting a palace in a fairy tale and contrasted with the meanness of the proscenium, where cracks showed the plaster under the gilding. The place was already warm. At their music stands the orchestra were tuning their instruments amid a delicate trilling of flutes, a stifled tooting of horns, a singing of violin notes, which floated forth amid the increasing uproar of voices. All the spectators were talking, jostling, settling themselves in a general assault upon seats; and the hustling rush in the side passages was now so violent that every door into the house was laboriously admitting the inexhaustible flood of people. There were signals, rustlings of fabrics, a continual march past of skirts and head dresses, accentuated by the black hue of a dress coat or a surtout. Notwithstanding this, the rows of seats were little by little getting filled up, while here and there a light toilet stood out from its surroundings, a head with a delicate profile bent forward under its chignon, where flashed the lightning of a jewel. In one of the boxes the tip of a bare shoulder glimmered like snowy silk. Other ladies, sitting at ease, languidly fanned themselves, following with their gaze the pushing movements of the crowd, while young gentlemen, standing up in the stalls, their waistcoats cut very low, gardenias in their buttonholes, pointed their opera glasses with gloved finger tips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_66" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在演出厅里，福什利和拉法卢瓦兹站在他们的座位前面，双目又环顾四周。 这时，大厅里已经灯火通明。高高的煤气火头，发出黄色和玫瑰色的光焰，把多枝水晶大吊灯照得雪亮，灯光从拱顶上成细雨状地反射到正厅里。座椅上的石榴红丝绒像漆一样闪闪发光，那些金色装饰闪烁着光芒，天花板上的色彩过分强烈，那些嫩绿色的装饰使耀眼夺目的光芒显得柔和了。舞台前的一排脚灯升高了，顿时发出一大片光亮，把幕布映得通红，沉沉的紫红色幕布像神话中的宫殿一样富丽堂皇，与舞台上的旧陋框架形成鲜明对照，金色框架上有一道道裂缝，露出了里面的泥灰。剧场内已经热起来了。乐师们对着乐谱架调整乐器的音色，笛子的轻快颤音，法国号的低沉呼鸣，小提琴的悦耳奏音交织在一起，在越来越高的嘈杂人声上空荡漾。每个观众都在讲话，互相推推搡搡，使尽全力找自己的位置，坐下来。过道里拥挤不堪，以至每个过道口好不容易才能放进来一股源源不断的人流，观众互相打招呼，衣服互相摩擦，在女人们的裙子和帽子中间夹杂着男人们的黑色礼服或燕尾服。一排排座位上渐渐坐满了人。一个穿着浅色服装的女人让人看得特别清楚，她的面颊俏丽，低着头，头上蓄着发髻，发髻上的首饰闪闪发亮。一个包厢里，一个女人裸露着一角肩膀，白皙得像白绸缎。其余妇女静静地坐着，无精打彩地摇着扇子，瞅着拥挤的人群。一些年轻先生们站在正厅前座里，背心敞开，钮扣洞里别着栀子花，用带着手套的手拿着望远镜观看。

Mignon and Steiner were together in a lower box, sitting side by side with their arms leaning for support on the velvet balustrade. Blanche de Sivry seemed to be in sole possession of a stage box on the level of the stalls. But La Faloise examined Daguenet before anyone else, he being in occupation of a stall two rows in front of his own. Close to him, a very young man, seventeen years old at the outside, some truant from college, it may be, was straining wide a pair of fine eyes such as a cherub might have owned. Fauchery smiled when he looked at him.

People still kept coming in; the stir and noise were on the increase. Among that public, peculiar to first nights and never subject to change, there were little subsections composed of intimate friends, who smilingly forgathered again. Old first-nighters, hat on head, seemed familiar and quite at ease and kept exchanging salutations. All Paris was there, the Paris of literature, of finance and of pleasure. There were many journalists, several authors, a number of stock-exchange people and more courtesans than honest women. It was a singularly mixed world, composed, as it was, of all the talents and tarnished by all the vices, a world where the same fatigue and the same fever played over every face. Fauchery, whom his cousin was questioning, showed him the boxes devoted to the newspapers and to the clubs and then named the dramatic critics—a lean, dried-up individual with thin, spiteful lips and, chief of all, a big fellow with a good-natured expression, lolling on the shoulder of his neighbor, a young miss over whom he brooded with tender and paternal eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_73" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时候，乐队指挥把指挥棒一举，乐师们便奏起序曲。观众还在不断地进场，骚乱和嘈杂声依然有增无减。特地来看首场演出的仍然是那些老观众，有的甚至关系还很密切，他们见了面，非常高兴。一些老观众由于彼此熟悉，态度很随便，有人不脱帽子就互相打招呼。这时，剧场成了巴黎的缩影，成了汇集巴黎文学界、金融界和寻欢作乐的人的场所，那里还有许多新闻记者，一些作家，交易所的投机家，也有一些轻佻的女人，她们比正经女人还要多。他们奇异地聚集到一起，其中各种人物都有，他们都染上了种种恶习，脸上都露出同样疲惫、同样兴奋的神态。福什利在他表弟的询问下，把报馆和俱乐部的包厢指给他看，并把那些戏剧批评家的名字一个个告诉他，其中一个人面孔瘦削，神情冷漠，长着两片险恶的薄嘴唇，他还特地指给他一个胖子，那人脸上显出一副和善的神情，懒洋洋地倚在身旁一个女人的肩上，用父爱的目光深情地注视着这个天真纯朴的姑娘。

Late arrivals were obliging whole rows of spectators to rise; the doors of boxes were banging; loud voices were heard disputing in the passages. And there was no cessation of the sound of many conversations, a sound similar to the loud twittering of talkative sparrows at close of day. All was in confusion; the house was a medley of heads and arms which moved to and fro, their owners seating themselves or trying to make themselves comfortable or, on the other hand, excitedly endeavoring to remain standing so as to take a final look round. The cry of "Sit down, sit down!" came fiercely from the obscure depths of the pit. A shiver of expectation traversed the house: at last people were going to make the acquaintance of this famous Nana with whom Paris had been occupying itself for a whole week!

And amid this swooning murmur, these perishing sighs of sound, the orchestra struck up the small, lively notes of a waltz with a vagabond rhythm bubbling with roguish laughter.

The first act of the Blonde Venus took place in Olympus, a pasteboard Olympus, with clouds in the wings and the throne of Jupiter on the right of the stage. First of all Iris and Ganymede, aided by a troupe of celestial attendants, sang a chorus while they arranged the seats of the gods for the council. Once again the prearranged applause of the clappers alone burst forth; the public, a little out of their depth, sat waiting. Nevertheless, La Faloise had clapped Clarisse Besnus, one of Bordenave's little women, who played Iris in a soft blue dress with a great scarf of the seven colors of the rainbow looped round her waist.

Now though she had neither the face nor the figure for the part, being thin and dark and of the adorable type of ugliness peculiar to a Parisian street child, she nonetheless appeared charming and as though she were a satire on the personage she represented. Her song at her entrance on the stage was full of lines quaint enough to make you cry with laughter and of complaints about Mars, who was getting ready to desert her for the companionship of Venus. She sang it with a chaste reserve so full of sprightly suggestiveness that the public warmed amain. The husband and Steiner, sitting side by side, were laughing complaisantly, and the whole house broke out in a roar when Prulliere, that great favorite, appeared as a general, a masquerade Mars, decked with an enormous plume and dragging along a sword, the hilt of which reached to his shoulder. As for him, he had had enough of Diana; she had been a great deal too coy with him, he averred. Thereupon Diana promised to keep a sharp eye on him and to be revenged. The duet ended with a comic yodel which Prulliere delivered very amusingly with the yell of an angry tomcat. He had about him all the entertaining fatuity of a young leading gentleman whose love affairs prosper, and he rolled around the most swaggering glances, which excited shrill feminine laughter in the boxes.

Old Bosc, an imbecile Jupiter with head crushed beneath the weight of an immense crown, only just succeeded in raising a smile among his audience when he had a domestic altercation with Juno on the subject of the cook's accounts. The march past of the gods, Neptune, Pluto, Minerva and the rest, was well-nigh spoiling everything. People grew impatient; there was a restless, slowly growing murmur; the audience ceased to take an interest in the performance and looked round at the house. Lucy began laughing with Labordette; the Count de Vandeuvres was craning his neck in conversation behind Blanche's sturdy shoulders, while Fauchery, out of the corners of his eyes, took stock of the Muffats, of whom the count appeared very serious, as though he had not understood the allusions, and the countess smiled vaguely, her eyes lost in reverie. But on a sudden, in this uncomfortable state of things, the applause of the clapping contingent rattled out with the regularity of platoon firing. People turned toward the stage. Was it Nana at last? This Nana made one wait with a vengeance.

The chorus, in quaint, dolorous tones, broken by silences full of pantomimic admissions, caused great amusement. A neat phrase went the round of the house: "The cuckolds' chorus, the cuckolds' chorus," and it "caught on," for there was an encore. The singers' heads were droll; their faces were discovered to be in keeping with the phrase, especially that of a fat man which was as round as the moon. Meanwhile Vulcan arrived in a towering rage, demanding back his wife who had slipped away three days ago. The chorus resumed their plaint, calling on Vulcan, the god of the cuckolds. Vulcan's part was played by Fontan, a comic actor of talent, at once vulgar and original, and he had a role of the wildest whimsicality and was got up as a village blacksmith, fiery red wig, bare arms tattooed with arrow-pierced hearts and all the rest of it. A woman's voice cried in a very high key, "Oh, isn't he ugly?" and all the ladies laughed and applauded.

Exceedingly tall, exceedingly strong, for her eighteen years, Nana, in her goddess's white tunic and with her light hair simply flowing unfastened over her shoulders, came down to the footlights with a quiet certainty of movement and a laugh of greeting for the public and struck up her grand ditty:

Never had a more tuneless voice been heard or one managed with less art. Her manager judged of her excellently; she certainly sang like a squirt. Nay, more, she didn't even know how to deport herself on the stage: she thrust her arms in front of her while she swayed her whole body to and fro in a manner which struck the audience as unbecoming and disagreeable. Cries of "Oh, oh!" were already rising in the pit and the cheap places. There was a sound of whistling, too, when a voice in the stalls, suggestive of a molting cockerel, cried out with great conviction:
</p></origin><translate id="div_95" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当她唱到第二句歌词时，观众都面面相觑。难道是在开玩笑吗？难道是博尔德纳夫的标新立异吗？观众从来没有听到过唱得如此走调的歌声，而且唱得如此不得法。她的经理说得好，她一唱就走调。她甚至连在舞台上如何站立都不会，她把两只手往前摆动，整个身子都摇晃起来，观众觉得很不得体，有失雅观。后座和廉价座里发出“哟，哟”的叫声，还有人吹起口哨，这时候，前座里响起了一个少年发育期变嗓的声音，一本正经地嚷道：

It was the cherub, the truant from the boarding-school, who sat with his fine eyes very wide open and his fair face glowing very hotly at sight of Nana. When he saw everybody turning toward him he grew extremely red at the thought of having thus unconsciously spoken aloud. Daguenet, his neighbor, smilingly examined him; the public laughed, as though disarmed and no longer anxious to hiss; while the young gentlemen in white gloves, fascinated in their turn by Nana's gracious contours, lolled back in their seats and applauded.
</p></origin><translate id="div_97" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>全场观众都把目光转向他，原来是那个天真烂漫的孩子，逃学的中学生，一双漂亮的眼睛睁得大大的，他一看见娜娜，金发下的面孔就兴奋起来。他看见大伙的目光都盯着自己，顿时变得面红耳赤，不禁为自己无意识地高声嚷叫而羞愧。达盖内坐在他的旁边，笑着打量他，观众都笑起来，仿佛心情平静下来了，再也不想吹口哨了；而那些戴白手套的年轻先生们，也被娜娜的线条迷住了，个个神魂颠倒，鼓起掌来。

She was an amusing creature, all the same, was that fine girl! Her laughter made a love of a little dimple appear in her chin. She stood there waiting, not bored in the least, familiar with her audience, falling into step with them at once, as though she herself were admitting with a wink that she had not two farthings' worth of talent but that it did not matter at all, that, in fact, she had other good points. And then after having made a sign to the conductor which plainly signified, "Go ahead, old boy!" she began her second verse:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_101');"><p>Still the same acidulated voice, only that now it tickled the public in the right quarter so deftly that momentarily it caused them to give a little shiver of pleasure. Nana still smiled her smile: it lit up her little red mouth and shone in her great eyes, which were of the clearest blue. When she came to certain rather lively verses a delicate sense of enjoyment made her tilt her nose, the rosy nostrils of which lifted and fell, while a bright flush suffused her cheeks. She still swung herself up and down, for she only knew how to do that. And the trick was no longer voted ugly; on the contrary, the men raised their opera glasses. When she came to the end of a verse her voice completely failed her, and she was well aware that she never would get through with it. Thereupon, rather than fret herself, she kicked up her leg, which forthwith was roundly outlined under her diaphanous tunic, bent sharply backward, so that her bosom was thrown upward and forward, and stretched her arms out. Applause burst forth on all sides. In the twinkling of an eye she had turned on her heel and was going up the stage, presenting the nape of her neck to the spectators' gaze, a neck where the red-gold hair showed like some animal's fell. Then the plaudits became frantic.
</p></origin><translate id="div_101" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的声音总是那么酸溜溜的，不过，现在她掌握了观众的胃口，她能使观众兴奋得不时发出轻轻的颤抖。娜娜一直满面笑容，这使她的樱桃小口发出光彩，浅蓝色的大眼睛炯炯有神。当她唱到某些比较欢快的歌词时，心里乐滋滋的，鼻子往上翘起，两边的玫瑰红鼻翼一起一伏，这时，两颊上泛起红晕。她继续摇晃着身体，她只会做这个动作。恰恰相反，观众不觉得这种动作难看，男人们拿起望远镜对准她看。她刚唱完这段歌词，就发不出一点声音来，她明白自己不能坚持到底。而她并不慌张，把屁股一扭，屁股在薄薄的内衣下露出圆圆的轮廓，她又把腰一挺，胸部向前挺起，随后把两臂向前伸去。这时，掌声四起。她又立刻转过身子，向舞台后部走去，把颈背朝向观众，颈背上长着棕红色的头发，犹如动物的绒毛；这时响起更热烈的掌声。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_102');"><p>The close of the act was not so exciting. Vulcan wanted to slap Venus. The gods held a consultation and decided to go and hold an inquiry on earth before granting the deceived husband satisfaction. It was then that Diana surprised a tender conversation between Venus and Mars and vowed that she would not take her eyes off them during the whole of the voyage. There was also a scene where Love, played by a little twelve-year-old chit, answered every question put to her with "Yes, Mamma! No, Mamma!" in a winy-piny tone, her fingers in her nose. At last Jupiter, with the severity of a master who is growing cross, shut Love up in a dark closet, bidding her conjugate the verb "I love" twenty times. The finale was more appreciated: it was a chorus which both troupe and orchestra performed with great brilliancy. But the curtain once down, the clappers tried in vain to obtain a call, while the whole house was already up and making for the doors.
</p></origin><translate id="div_102" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这一幕结束时，气氛变得比较冷落。火神想打爱神一记耳光。众神举行了会议，决定由众神到人间去进行一次调查，再次对当乌龟的丈夫们作出令其满意的回答。这时，月神偷听到爱神和战神在谈情说爱，便发誓要在下凡期间密切监视他们。这一幕里还有一场戏，爱神由一个十二岁小女孩扮演，她对什么问题，都用呜啦呜啦的哭丧声音回答：“是的，妈妈……不是，妈妈……”朱庇特发火了，他摆出主人的威风，把小爱神关在一间黑洞洞的房间里，让她把动词“爱”变位二十次。观众对结尾还是颇感兴趣的，那是一场大合唱，演唱者和乐团都演得非常出色。帷幕落下来了，雇来捧场的人发出一阵掌声，想让演员谢幕一次，可是观众都站起来了，向门口走去。

The piece, however, mattered very little, for people were talking about Nana before everything else. Fauchery and La Faloise, being among the earliest to emerge, met Steiner and Mignon in the passage outside the stalls. In this gaslit gut of a place, which was as narrow and circumscribed as a gallery in a mine, one was well-nigh suffocated. They stopped a moment at the foot of the stairs on the right of the house, protected by the final curve of the balusters. The audience from the cheap places were coming down the steps with a continuous tramp of heavy boots; a stream of black dress coats was passing, while an attendant was making every possible effort to protect a chair, on which she had piled up coats and cloaks, from the onward pushing of the crowd.

Steiner, who was no longer listening, seemed to awake with a start. Whatever happens, one must wait, he thought. Perhaps everything will be spoiled in the following acts. The public had shown complaisance, but it was certainly not yet taken by storm. Mignon swore that the piece would never finish, and when Fauchery and La Faloise left them in order to go up to the foyer he took Steiner's arm and, leaning hard against his shoulder, whispered in his ear:

The two cousins hesitated an instant before entering, for the widely opened glazed doors afforded a view right through the gallery—a view of a surging sea of heads, which two currents, as it were, kept in a continuous eddying movement. But they entered after all. Five or six groups of men, talking very loudly and gesticulating, were obstinately discussing the play amid these violent interruptions; others were filing round, their heels, as they turned, sounding sharply on the waxed floor. To right and left, between columns of variegated imitation marble, women were sitting on benches covered with red velvet and viewing the passing movement of the crowd with an air of fatigue as though the heat had rendered them languid. In the lofty mirrors behind them one saw the reflection of their chignons. At the end of the room, in front of the bar, a man with a huge corporation was drinking a glass of fruit syrup.

La Faloise, who was studying the photographs of actresses hung in frames alternating with the mirrors between the columns, ended by following him. They had extinguished the line of gas jets on the facade of the theater, and it was dark and very cool on the balcony, which seemed to them unoccupied. Solitary and enveloped in shadow, a young man was standing, leaning his arms on the stone balustrade, in the recess to the right. He was smoking a cigarette, of which the burning end shone redly.

Despite the lateness of the hour the crowd were still crushing and being crushed; people were advancing with shortened step; a throng was constantly emerging from the Passage Jouffroy; individuals stood waiting five or six minutes before they could cross the roadway, to such a distance did the string of carriages extend.

It represented a suburban Shrove Tuesday dance at the Boule Noire. Masqueraders were trolling a catch, the chorus of which was accompanied with a tapping of their heels. This 'Arryish departure, which nobody had in the least expected, caused so much amusement that the house encored the catch. And it was to this entertainment that the divine band, let astray by Iris, who falsely bragged that he knew the Earth well, were now come in order to proceed with their inquiry. They had put on disguises so as to preserve their incognito. Jupiter came on the stage as King Dagobert, with his breeches inside out and a huge tin crown on his head. Phoebus appeared as the Postillion of Lonjumeau and Minerva as a Norman nursemaid. Loud bursts of merriment greeted Mars, who wore an outrageous uniform, suggestive of an Alpine admiral. But the shouts of laughter became uproarious when Neptune came in view, clad in a blouse, a high, bulging workman's cap on his head, lovelocks glued to his temples. Shuffling along in slippers, he cried in a thick brogue.

This carnival of the gods, this dragging in the mud of their Olympus, this mock at a whole religion, a whole world of poetry, appeared in the light of a royal entertainment. The fever of irreverence gained the literary first-night world: legend was trampled underfoot; ancient images were shattered. Jupiter's make-up was capital. Mars was a success. Royalty became a farce and the army a thing of folly. When Jupiter, grown suddenly amorous of a little laundress, began to knock off a mad cancan, Simonne, who was playing the part of the laundress, launched a kick at the master of the immortals' nose and addressed him so drolly as "My big daddy!" that an immoderate fit of laughter shook the whole house. While they were dancing Phoebus treated Minerva to salad bowls of negus, and Neptune sat in state among seven or eight women who regaled him with cakes. Allusions were eagerly caught; indecent meanings were attached to them; harmless phrases were diverted from their proper significations in the light of exclamations issuing from the stalls. For a long time past the theatrical public had not wallowed in folly more irreverent. It rested them.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_131');"><p>Nevertheless, the action of the piece advanced amid these fooleries. Vulcan, as an elegant young man clad, down to his gloves, entirely in yellow and with an eyeglass stuck in his eye, was forever running after Venus, who at last made her appearance as a fishwife, a kerchief on her head and her bosom, covered with big gold trinkets, in great evidence. Nana was so white and plump and looked so natural in a part demanding wide hips and a voluptuous mouth that she straightway won the whole house. On her account Rose Mignon was forgotten, though she was made up as a delicious baby, with a wicker-work burlet on her head and a short muslin frock and had just sighed forth Diana's plaints in a sweetly pretty voice. The other one, the big wench who slapped her thighs and clucked like a hen, shed round her an odor of life, a sovereign feminine charm, with which the public grew intoxicated. From the second act onward everything was permitted her. She might hold herself awkwardly; she might fail to sing some note in tune; she might forget her words—it mattered not: she had only to turn and laugh to raise shouts of applause. When she gave her famous kick from the hip the stalls were fired, and a glow of passion rose upward, upward, from gallery to gallery, till it reached the gods. It was a triumph, too, when she led the dance. She was at home in that: hand on hip, she enthroned Venus in the gutter by the pavement side. And the music seemed made for her plebeian voice—shrill, piping music, with reminiscences of Saint-Cloud Fair, wheezings of clarinets and playful trills on the part of the little flutes.

Juno, as a peasant woman, caught Jupiter and his little laundress cleverly and boxed his ears. Diana, surprising Venus in the act of making an assignation with Mars, made haste to indicate hour and place to Vulcan, who cried, "I've hit on a plan!" The rest of the act did not seem very clear. The inquiry ended in a final galop after which Jupiter, breathless, streaming with perspiration and minus his crown, declared that the little women of Earth were delicious and that the men were all to blame.

People in passing mentioned his name to each other in muttered tones. He had laughed the whole act through—that was the rumor going the round of the passages—nevertheless, he was now very severe and spoke of taste and morals.

Only a well-bred whispering was audible under the great chandelier, the light of which was softened in the fine cloud of dust raised by the confused movements of the interval.

The tall mirrors reflected this thronging world of heads to infinity and magnified the narrow room beyond measure with its three chandeliers, its moleskin-covered seats and its winding staircase draped with red. Steiner went and seated himself at a table in the first saloon, which opened full on the boulevard, its doors having been removed rather early for the time of year. As Fauchery and La Faloise were passing the banker stopped them.

The clappers applauded the scenery, which represented a grotto on Mount Etna, hollowed out in a silver mine and with sides glittering like new money. In the background Vulcan's forge glowed like a setting star. Diana, since the second act, had come to a good understanding with the god, who was to pretend that he was on a journey, so as to leave the way clear for Venus and Mars. Then scarcely was Diana alone than Venus made her appearance. A shiver of delight ran round the house. Nana was nude. With quiet audacity she appeared in her nakedness, certain of the sovereign power of her flesh. Some gauze enveloped her, but her rounded shoulders, her Amazonian bosom, her wide hips, which swayed to and fro voluptuously, her whole body, in fact, could be divined, nay discerned, in all its foamlike whiteness of tint beneath the slight fabric she wore. It was Venus rising from the waves with no veil save her tresses. And when Nana lifted her arms the golden hairs in her armpits were observable in the glare of the footlights. There was no applause. Nobody laughed any more. The men strained forward with serious faces, sharp features, mouths irritated and parched. A wind seemed to have passed, a soft, soft wind, laden with a secret menace. Suddenly in the bouncing child the woman stood discovered, a woman full of restless suggestion, who brought with her the delirium of sex and opened the gates of the unknown world of desire. Nana was smiling still, but her smile was now bitter, as of a devourer of men.

Then ensued a passage which Prulliere played with great delicacy. Petted by Diana, who wanted to make a final attack upon his feelings before delivering him up to Vulcan, wheedled by Venus, whom the presence of her rival excited, he gave himself up to these tender delights with the beatified expression of a man in clover. Finally a grand trio brought the scene to a close, and it was then that an attendant appeared in Lucy Stewart's box and threw on the stage two immense bouquets of white lilacs. There was applause; Nana and Rose Mignon bowed, while Prulliere picked up the bouquets. Many of the occupants of the stalls turned smilingly toward the ground-floor occupied by Steiner and Mignon. The banker, his face blood-red, was suffering from little convulsive twitchings of the chin, as though he had a stoppage in his throat.

Diana had gone off in a rage, and directly afterward, Venus, sitting on a moss-clad seat, called Mars to her. Never yet had a more glowing scene of seduction been ventured on. Nana, her arms round Prulliere's neck, was drawing him toward her when Fontan, with comically furious mimicry and an exaggerated imitation of the face of an outraged husband who surprises his wife in FLAGRANTE DELICTO, appeared at the back of the grotto. He was holding the famous net with iron meshes. For an instant he poised and swung it, as a fisherman does when he is going to make a cast, and by an ingenious twist Venus and Mars were caught in the snare; the net wrapped itself round them and held them motionless in the attitude of happy lovers.

At that moment her slightest movement blew the flame of desire: with her little finger she ruled men's flesh. Backs were arched and quivered as though unseen violin bows had been drawn across their muscles; upon men's shoulders appeared fugitive hairs, which flew in air, blown by warm and wandering breaths, breathed one knew not from what feminine mouth. In front of him Fauchery saw the truant schoolboy half lifted from his seat by passion. Curiosity led him to look at the Count de Vandeuvres—he was extremely pale, and his lips looked pinched—at fat Steiner, whose face was purple to the verge of apoplexy; at Labordette, ogling away with the highly astonished air of a horse dealer admiring a perfectly shaped mare; at Daguenet, whose ears were blood-red and twitching with enjoyment. Then a sudden idea made him glance behind, and he marveled at what he saw in the Muffats' box. Behind the countess, who was white and serious as usual, the count was sitting straight upright, with mouth agape and face mottled with red, while close by him, in the shadow, the restless eyes of the Marquis de Chouard had become catlike phosphorescent, full of golden sparkles. The house was suffocating; people's very hair grew heavy on their perspiring heads. For three hours back the breath of the multitude had filled and heated the atmosphere with a scent of crowded humanity. Under the swaying glare of the gas the dust clouds in mid-air had grown constantly denser as they hung motionless beneath the chandelier. The whole house seemed to be oscillating, to be lapsing toward dizziness in its fatigue and excitement, full, as it was, of those drowsy midnight desires which flutter in the recesses of the bed of passion. And Nana, in front of this languorous public, these fifteen hundred human beings thronged and smothered in the exhaustion and nervous exasperation which belong to the close of a spectacle, Nana still triumphed by right of her marble flesh and that sexual nature of hers, which was strong enough to destroy the whole crowd of her adorers and yet sustain no injury.

In answer to Vulcan's triumphant summons all the Olympians defiled before the lovers with ohs and ahs of stupefaction and gaiety. Jupiter said, "I think it is light conduct on your part, my son, to summon us to see such a sight as this." Then a reaction took place in favor of Venus. The chorus of cuckolds was again ushered in by Iris and besought the master of the gods not to give effect to its petition, for since women had lived at home, domestic life was becoming impossible for the men: the latter preferred being deceived and happy. That was the moral of the play. Then Venus was set at liberty, and Vulcan obtained a partial divorce from her. Mars was reconciled with Diana, and Jove, for the sake of domestic peace, packed his little laundress off into a constellation. And finally they extricated Love from his black hole, where instead of conjugating the verb AMO he had been busy in the manufacture of "dollies." The curtain fell on an apotheosis, wherein the cuckolds' chorus knelt and sang a hymn of gratitude to Venus, who stood there with smiling lips, her stature enhanced by her sovereign nudity.

Steiner, in tow of Mignon, had left the house among the foremost. The Count de Vandeuvres took his departure with Blanche de Sivry on his arm. For a moment or two Gaga and her daughter seemed doubtful how to proceed, but Labordette made haste to go and fetch them a conveyance, the door whereof he gallantly shut after them. Nobody saw Daguenet go by. As the truant schoolboy, registering a mental vow to wait at the stage door, was running with burning cheeks toward the Passage des Panoramas, of which he found the gate closed, Satin, standing on the edge of the pavement, moved forward and brushed him with her skirts, but he in his despair gave her a savage refusal and vanished amid the crowd, tears of impotent desire in his eyes.
