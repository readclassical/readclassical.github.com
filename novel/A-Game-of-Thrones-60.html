</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5381');"><p>As the host trooped down the causeway through the black bogs of the Neck and spilled out into the riverlands beyond, Catelyn’s apprehensions grew. She masked her fears behind a face kept still and stern, yet they were there all the same, growing with every league they crossed. Her days were anxious, her nights restless, and every raven that flew overhead made her clench her teeth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5381" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>眼看部队沿堤道穿过颈泽的黑色沼地，涌进彼方的河间地区，凯特琳的忧虑与日俱增。虽然她将恐惧埋藏在沉着冷静的面具之下，但它依旧存在，并随着他们跨越的每一里格不断增长。白天她焦虑不安，晚上则辗转反侧，每一只飞过头顶的渡鸦，都令她不禁咬紧牙关。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5382');"><p>She feared for her lord father, and wondered at his ominous silence. She feared for her brother Edmure, and prayed that the gods would watch over him if he must face the Kingslayer in battle. She feared for Ned and her girls, and for the sweet sons she had left behind at Winterfell. And yet there was nothing she could do for any of them, and so she made herself put all thought of them aside. You must save your strength for Robb, she told herself. He is the only one you can help. You must be as fierce and hard as the north, Catelyn Tully. You must be a Stark for true now, like your son.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5382" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她为父亲恐惧，对他的缄默大惑不解。她为弟弟艾德慕恐惧，并暗自祈求，倘若他必须与弑君者在战场上相见，请天上诸神务必看护他。她更为奈德和两个女儿，为那两个她丢在临冬城不管的乖儿子恐惧。然而，她对他们每一个人都无能为力，于是她逼迫自己将这些念头统统抛到脑后。你必须将力量留给罗柏，她这么对自己说，他是你惟一帮得上忙的人。凯特琳•徒利，现在的你，必须像北方一样坚毅刚强，必须成为一个名符其实的史塔克家人，像你的儿子一样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5383');"><p>Robb rode at the front of the column, beneath the flapping white banner of Winterfell. Each day he would ask one of his lords to join him, so they might confer as they marched; he honored every man in turn, showing no favorites, listening as his lord father had listened, weighing the words of one against the other. He has learned so much from Ned, she thought as she watched him, but has he learned enough?
</p></origin><translate id="div_5383" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏骑马走在队伍最前面，临冬城的白色旗臶在他头顶迎风飘扬。每天，他都会请一位封臣与他同行，借此机会讨论战略；他轮流邀请每一位诸侯，丝毫没有表现出个人好恶，像他的父亲一样用心聆听对方意见，仔细衡量每种说法。他从奈德那里学了好多，她看着他，心里想着，可他学够了吗?
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5384');"><p>The Blackfish had taken a hundred picked men and a hundred swift horses and raced ahead to screen their movements and scout the way. The reports Ser Brynden’s riders brought back did little to reassure her. Lord Tywin’s host was still many days to the south?.?.?.?but Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, had assembled a force of near four thousand men at his castles on the Green Fork.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5384" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>黑鱼精挑细选出一百个人和一百匹好马，当先到前方掩蔽他们的行踪，并执行侦察任务。而布林登爵士的部下回报的消息，丝毫未能纾解她的忧虑。泰温大人的部队虽与他们仍有相当距离……但河渡口领主瓦德•佛雷却已在他绿叉河畔的城堡聚集了近四千的兵力。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5385');"><p>"Late again," Catelyn murmured when she heard. It was the Trident all over, damn the man. Her brother Edmure had called the banners; by rights, Lord Frey should have gone to join the Tully host at Riverrun, yet here he sat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5385" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“又迟到了。”凯特琳得知消息时，不禁喃喃自语。这人真该遭天谴，眼下简直是当年三叉戟河之战的翻版。她的弟弟艾德慕既已召集封臣，照说佛雷侯爵早该率兵前往奔流城加入徒利大军，结果他却按兵不动。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5386');"><p>"Four thousand men," Robb repeated, more perplexed than angry. "Lord Frey cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by himself. Surely he means to join his power to ours."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5386" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“四千人，”罗柏复诵了一辫，话中有些恼火，更有困惑。“佛雷大人绝不可能单独对付兰尼斯特军，所以他一定打算加入我们。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5387');"><p>"Does he?" Catelyn asked. She had ridden forward to join Robb and Robett Glover, his companion of the day. The vanguard spread out behind them, a slow-moving forest of lances and banners and spears. "I wonder. Expect nothing of Walder Frey, and you will never be surprised."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5387" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是吗?”凯特琳反问。她骑到队伍前方，与罗柏和他今天的同伴罗贝特•葛洛佛同行。先锋军散开跟在他们身后，犹如一座由枪戟、旗臶和长矛组成的森林，缓缓移动。”我可不敢说。决不要对瓦德•佛雷抱任何期望，到时候你就不会觉得意外。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5388');"><p>"He’s your father’s bannerman."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5388" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可他是外公的封臣。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5389');"><p>"Some men take their oaths more seriously than others, Robb. And Lord Walder was always friendlier with Casterly Rock than my father would have liked. One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister’s sister. That means little of itself, to be sure. Lord Walder has sired a great many children over the years, and they must needs marry someone. Still?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5389" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“罗柏，不是每个人都把自己立下的誓言当回事的，更何况瓦德大人与凯岩城的友好程度，向来令你外公不满。他有一个儿子就是娶了泰温•兰尼斯特的妹妹，虽说这算不了什么，瓦德大人膝下儿孙满堂，他们总是得结婚的。不过……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5390');"><p>"Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters, my lady?" Robett Glover asked gravely.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5390" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，您认为他打算把我们出卖给兰尼斯特?”罗贝特•葛洛佛语气沉重地问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5391');"><p>Catelyn sighed. "If truth be told, I doubt even Lord Frey knows what Lord Frey intends to do. He has an old man’s caution and a young man’s ambition, and has never lacked for cunning."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5391" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳叹道：“说真的，我怀疑佛雷大人自己都不确定有何打算。他既有老人家的行事谨慎，又有年轻人的野心勃勃，更不缺精打细算。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5392');"><p>"We must have the Twins, Mother," Robb said heatedly. "There is no other way across the river. You know that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5392" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“母亲，我们一定要得到孪河城的支持。”罗柏的口气有些冲，“你也知道，除此之外无处可以渡河。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5393');"><p>"Yes. And so does Walder Frey, you can be sure of that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5393" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没错，而且你大可放心，瓦德•佛雷也很清楚。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5394');"><p>That night they made camp on the southern edge of the bogs, halfway between the kingsroad and the river. It was there Theon Greyjoy brought them further word from her uncle. "Ser Brynden says to tell you he’s crossed swords with the Lannisters. There are a dozen scouts who won’t be reporting back to Lord Tywin anytime soon. Or ever." He grinned. "Ser Addam Marbrand commands their outriders, and he’s pulling back south, burning as he goes. He knows where we are, more or less, but the Blackfish vows he will not know when we split."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5394" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当晚，他们在沼泽的南界扎营，正好在国王大道和河流中间。席恩•葛雷乔伊便是在此为他们带来她叔叔的新情报。”布林登爵士要我告诉你们，他已经和兰尼斯特军发生了遭遇战。有十来个斥候大概暂时不会回去跟泰温大人报告了，我看他们永远也回不去了。”他嘻嘻笑道，”负责指挥敌军侦察部队的是亚当•马尔布兰爵士，他正掉头往南，沿途到处放火。他约略知道我们的位置，但黑鱼发誓绝不让他知道我们何时兵分两路。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5395');"><p>"Unless Lord Frey tells him," Catelyn said sharply. "Theon, when you return to my uncle, tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the Twins, day and night, with orders to bring down any raven they see leaving the battlements. I want no birds bringing word of my son’s movements to Lord Tywin."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5395" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“除非佛雷大人告诉他。”凯特琳语气尖锐，“席恩，你回去之后，请我叔叔将手下最厉害的弓箭手布置在孪河城四周，日夜监视，一旦有渡鸦出城，立刻将其舐下，我不希望有任何飞鸟将我儿的动向报告给泰温大人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5396');"><p>"Ser Brynden has seen to it already, my lady," Theon replied with a cocky smile. "A few more blackbirds, and we should have enough to bake a pie. I’ll save you their feathers for a hat."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5396" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，布林登大人早已这么办了。”席恩带着一抹得意的笑容回答，“再多几只黑鸟，我们都可以拿来做馅饼了。我会把羽毛留下来给您做顶帽子的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5397');"><p>She ought to have known that Brynden Blackfish would be well ahead of her. "What have the Freys been doing while the Lannisters burn their fields and plunder their holdfasts?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5397" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她早该想到，黑鱼布林登的考虑远比自己周详。“既然兰尼斯特军纵火焚烧佛雷家族的田地，掠夺他们的农舍，那他们有何反应?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5398');"><p>"There’s been some fighting between Ser Addam’s men and Lord Walder’s," Theon answered. "Not a day’s ride from here, we found two Lannister scouts feeding the crows where the Freys had strung them up. Most of Lord Walder’s strength remains massed at the Twins, though."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5398" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“亚当爵士和瓦德大人双方的部队有过遭遇战，”席恩回答，“距此不到一日骑程，我们发现两个兰尼斯特斥候被佛雷家士兵绑起来喂乌鸦。当然，瓦德大人绝大多数兵力集结在孪河城。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5399');"><p>That bore Walder Frey’s seal beyond a doubt, Catelyn thought bitterly; hold back, wait, watch, take no risk unless forced to it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5399" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>按兵不动，静观其变，不明动态，绝不出手，这真是瓦德•佛雷的不改作风，凯特琳苦涩地想。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5400');"><p>"If he’s been fighting the Lannisters, perhaps he does mean to hold to his vows," Robb said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5400" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“既然他已和兰尼斯特军开战，或许他的确有意遵守誓言。”罗柏道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5401');"><p>Catelyn was less encouraged. "Defending his own lands is one thing, open battle against Lord Tywin quite another."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5401" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳可没那么乐观。“保护自己的领地是一回事，公然与泰温大人作战又是另一回事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5402');"><p>Robb turned back to Theon Greyjoy. "Has the Blackfish found any other way across the Green Fork?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5402" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏转头对席恩•葛雷乔伊说：“黑鱼有没有发现其他渡过绿叉河的方法?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5403');"><p>Theon shook his head. "The river’s running high and fast. Ser Brynden says it can’t be forded, not this far north."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5403" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>席恩摇摇头。“现在水位很高，水流又湍急，布林登爵士说在这么上游的地方是不可能渡河的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5404');"><p>"I must have that crossing!" Robb declared, fuming. "Oh, our horses might be able to swim the river, I suppose, but not with armored men on their backs. We’d need to build rafts to pole our steel across, helms and mail and lances, and we don’t have the trees for that. Or the time. Lord Tywin is marching north?.?.?.?" He balled his hand into a fist.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5404" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我非渡河不可!”罗柏火冒三丈，”唉，我们的马或许可以游泳，但驮着全副武装的人可不行。我们得建造木筏，把头盔、铠甲和长枪等兵器运过去，可我们不但没有木头，更没有时间。泰温大人已经往北来了……”他握紧拳头。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5405');"><p>"Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way," Theon Greyjoy said with his customary easy confidence. "We have five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you need to, Robb."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5405" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“佛雷大人若想阻拦我们，就是自寻死路。”席恩•葛雷乔伊以他一贯的自信口吻说，“我们的兵力足足是他五倍，罗柏，如果必要，你可以轻易拿下孪河城。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5406');"><p>"Not easily," Catelyn warned them, "and not in time. While you were mounting your siege, Tywin Lannister would bring up his host and assault you from the rear."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5406" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“恐怕不容易，”凯特琳警告他们，“至少绝非短时间内可以攻下。当你们还在架舔攻城器械的时候，泰温•兰尼斯特便会带着大军从后掩杀而来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5407');"><p>Robb glanced from her to Greyjoy, searching for an answer and finding none. For a moment he looked even younger than his fifteen years, despite his mail and sword and the stubble on his cheeks. "What would my lord father do?" he asked her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5407" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏看看她，又看看葛雷乔伊，想要找寻答案，但徒劳无功。一时之间，他虽然披甲带剑，两颊又留了短须，看起来却比十五岁还要年幼。“父亲会怎么做?”他问她。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5408');"><p>"Find a way across," she told him. "Whatever it took."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5408" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“想办法过河，”她告诉他，“用尽一切方法。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5409');"><p>The next morning it was Ser Brynden Tully himself who rode back to them. He had put aside the heavy plate and helm he’d worn as the Knight of the Gate for the lighter leather-and-mail of an outrider, but his obsidian fish still fastened his cloak.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5409" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>翌日清晨，布林登•徒利爵士亲自骑马回报，他已经卸下血门骑士的重铠和头盔，换上轻便的斥候皮甲，但那条黑曜石雕的鱼依旧扣住披风。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5410');"><p>Her uncle’s face was grave as he swung down off his horse. "There has been a battle under the walls of Riverrun," he said, his mouth grim. "We had it from a Lannister outrider we took captive. The Kingslayer has destroyed Edmure’s host and sent the lords of the Trident reeling in flight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5410" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>叔叔脸色沉重地翻身下马。“奔流城下有一场战事，”他抿抿嘴，“我们是从一个被俘的兰尼斯特斥候口中听说的。弑君者歼灭了艾德慕的军队，把三河诸侯打得四散奔逃。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5411');"><p>A cold hand clutched at Catelyn’s heart. "And my brother?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5411" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一只冰冷的手攫住了凯特琳的心。“我弟弟怎样? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5412');"><p>"Wounded and taken prisoner," Ser Brynden said. "Lord Blackwood and the other survivors are under siege inside Riverrun, surrounded by Jaime’s host."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5412" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“受伤被俘，”布林登爵士道，“布莱伍德大人和其他生还者被困在奔流城里，詹姆的大军将他们团团包围。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5413');"><p>Robb looked fretful. "We must get across this accursed river if we’re to have any hope of relieving them in time."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5413" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏一脸焦躁。“我们得赶紧渡过这条该死的河，否则就来不及了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5414');"><p>"That will not be easily done," her uncle cautioned. "Lord Frey has pulled his whole strength back inside his castles, and his gates are closed and barred."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5414" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“恐怕不容易，”叔叔告诫他，“佛雷大人所有的兵力现下都在城里，城门却是紧紧关闭。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5415');"><p>"Damn the man," Robb swore. "If the old fool does not relent and let me cross, he’ll leave me no choice but to storm his walls. I’ll pull the Twins down around his ears if I have to, we’ll see how well he likes that!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5415" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这家伙该死，”罗柏咒道，“如果这老王八蛋不肯让我过去，我别无选择，非得攻城不可，待我们把孪河城拆个一干二净，瞧他喜不喜欢!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5416');"><p>"You sound like a sulky boy, Robb," Catelyn said sharply. "A child sees an obstacle, and his first thought is to run around it or knock it down. A lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5416" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“罗柏，你的话听起来活像个赌气的小孩。”凯特琳口气锐利地说，“小孩子一遇阻碍，不是想绕过去，就是想把它推倒。作为一方领主，你得清楚言语有时候可以解决武力所办不到的事。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5417');"><p>Robb’s neck reddened at the rebuke. "Tell me what you mean, Mother," he said meekly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5417" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>听她责备，罗柏从脸孔红到脖子。“母亲，请您告诉我您的意见。”他口气温顺地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5418');"><p>"The Freys have held the crossing for six hundred years, and for six hundred years they have never failed to exact their toll."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5418" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“佛雷家族把守渡口已经六百年，六百年来，他们从来不忘收取过桥费。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5419');"><p>"What toll? What does he want?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5419" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“过桥费? 他到底想怎样? ’， 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5420');"><p>She smiled. "That is what we must discover."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5420" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她微笑道：“这就轮到我们去发现了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5421');"><p>"And what if I do not choose to pay this toll?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5421" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“假如我不打算付过桥费呢?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5422');"><p>"Then you had best retreat back to Moat Cailin, deploy to meet Lord Tywin in battle?.?.?.?or grow wings. I see no other choices." Catelyn put her heels to her horse and rode off, leaving her son to ponder her words. It would not do to make him feel as if his mother were usurping his place. Did you teach him wisdom as well as valor, Ned? she wondered. Did you teach him how to kneel? The graveyards of the Seven Kingdoms were full of brave men who had never learned that lesson.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5422" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么你最好退回卡林湾，布好阵势迎接泰温大人……不然就是长出翅膀。我看没别的方法。”凯特琳轻踢马肚，向前奔去，让儿子留下来思索她的话。若是让他觉得母亲在抢夺他的权位，那可不成。奈德，除了勇气之外，你可有教导他臹慧?她暗想，你可有教导他如何低头? 七大王国的坟墓里多的是徒有勇武，却不知该何时低头的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5423');"><p>It was near midday when their vanguard came in sight of the Twins, where the Lords of the Crossing had their seat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5423" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>日近正午，孪河城进入先锋部队的视线，此地便是河渡口领主的根据地。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5424');"><p>The Green Fork ran swift and deep here, but the Freys had spanned it many centuries past and grown rich off the coin men paid them to cross. Their bridge was a massive arch of smooth grey rock, wide enough for two wagons to pass abreast; the Water Tower rose from the center of the span, commanding both road and river with its arrow slits, murder holes, and portcullises. It had taken the Freys three generations to complete their bridge; when they were done they’d thrown up stout timber keeps on either bank, so no one might cross without their leave.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5424" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这里的绿叉河水既深且急，但佛雷家族的势力早在几世纪前便横跨两岸，并靠着渡河者缴纳的费用致富。他们建造的通道是一座巨大的平滑灰石拱桥，宽度足以让两部马车并肩而行；卫河塔矗立于弧桥中央，以其舐箭孔、杀人洞和铁闸门睥睨河流和道路。佛雷家花了三代才完成这座拱桥，竣工之后，他们在两岸都筑起木头堡垒，如此一来，任何人若未经他们允许，都不能过河。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5425');"><p>The timber had long since given way to stone. The Twins, two squat, ugly, formidable castles, identical in every respect, with the bridge arching between, had guarded the crossing for centuries. High curtain walls, deep moats, and heavy oak-and-iron gates protected the approaches, the bridge footings rose from within stout inner keeps, there was a barbican and portcullis on either bank, and the Water Tower defended the span itself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5425" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>如今木头早巳改为石材，孪河城——两座方正、丑陋却坚固的城堡，两边的样貌几乎完全相同，拱桥则横越其间——已经守护渡口几世纪之久。它有着高耸的城墙，深深的护城河和厚重的橡木镶铁门。桥的两边入口均位于防护严密的内城，两岸有桥头堡和铁闸门，河中央则由卫河塔保护。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5426');"><p>One glance was sufficient to tell Catelyn that the castle would not be taken by storm. The battlements bristled with spears and swords and scorpions, there was an archer at every crenel and arrow slit, the drawbridge was up, the portcullis down, the gates closed and barred.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5426" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳只需一眼，便看出面前的城堡无法迅速攻陷。城墙上处处是枪剑光影和大型弓弩，每个雉堞和箭口皆有弓箭手部署，吊桥已经升起，闸门也已降下。城门紧闭，扣上门闩。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5427');"><p>The Greatjon began to curse and swear as soon as he saw what awaited them. Lord Rickard Karstark glowered in silence. "That cannot be assaulted, my lords," Roose Bolton announced.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5427" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大琼恩一见，立即开始高声咒骂。瑞卡德•卡史塔克伯爵则静静地怒视。“诸位大人，这样的城堡无法在短时间内攻下。”卢斯•波顿表示。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5428');"><p>"Nor can we take it by siege, without an army on the far bank to invest the other castle," Helman Tallhart said gloomily. Across the deep-running green waters, the western twin stood like a reflection of its eastern brother. "Even if we had the time. Which, to be sure, we do not."

If I’d known how they’d shame me, I would never have troubled myself to make the journey. Why did I need to ride all that way to see Hosteen knocked off his horse by that Tyrell whelp? I ask you. The boy’s half his age, Ser Daisy they call him, something like that. And Danwell was unhorsed by a hedge knight! Some days I wonder if those two are truly mine. My third wife was a Crakehall, all of the Crakehall women are sluts. Well, never mind about that, she died before you were born, what do you care?

She frosted up as if I’d suggested selling her boy to a mummer’s show or making a eunuch out of him, and when Lord Arryn said the child was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis Baratheon, she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies.
