</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3080');"><p>My lady, you should have sent word of your coming," Ser Donnel Waynwood told her as their horses climbed the pass. "We would have sent an escort. The high road is not as safe as it once was, for a party as small as yours."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3080" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，您应该先捎个信来，”他们骑马爬上山口，唐纳尔•韦伍德爵士对她说，“那样的话，我们就可以派人护送。这年头山路的安全不比从前，更何况您只带了这么点人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3081');"><p>"We learned that to our sorrow, Ser Donnel," Catelyn said. Sometimes she felt as though her heart had turned to stone; six brave men had died to bring her this far, and she could not even find it in her to weep for them. Even their names were fading. "The clansmen harried us day and night. We lost three men in the first attack, and two more in the second, and Lannister’s serving man died of a fever when his wounds festered. When we heard your men approaching, I thought us doomed for certain." They had drawn up for a last desperate fight, blades in hand and backs to the rock. The dwarf had been whetting the edge of his axe and making some mordant jest when Bronn spotted the banner the riders carried before them, the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky-blue and white. Catelyn had never seen a more welcome sight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3081" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“唐纳尔爵士，我们的确是尝到了惨痛的教训。”凯特琳道。有时候她觉得自己铁石心肠。六个英勇的人牺牲了性命，她才能走到这里，然而她却连为他们掬一把泪都做不到。就连他们的名姓，也越来越模糊。“原住民日夜骚扰，我们第一次损失了三个人，后来又死了两个，兰尼斯特的仆人伤口溃烂，死于高烧。听到你手下接近的声音时，我本以为我们完蛋了。”他们决定孤注一掷，手握武器，背靠岩壁。侏儒当时一边磨斧头，一边开着语气辛辣的玩笑，这时波隆首先看到来者高举的旗臶，正是艾林家族的蓝底白色新月猎鹰辬志。对凯特琳而言，再也没有比这更受她欢迎的东西了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3082');"><p>"The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died," Ser Donnel said. He was a stocky youth of twenty years, earnest and homely, with a wide nose and a shock of thick brown hair. "If it were up to me, I would take a hundred men into the mountains, root them out of their fastnesses, and teach them some sharp lessons, but your sister has forbidden it. She would not even permit her knights to fight in the Hand’s tourney. She wants all our swords kept close to home, to defend the Vale?.?.?.?against what, no one is certain. Shadows, some say." He looked at her anxiously, as if he had suddenly remembered who she was. "I hope I have not spoken out of turn, my lady. I meant no offense."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3082" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“琼恩大人死后，这些原住民越来越胆大包天。”唐纳尔爵士道。他是个二十岁的年轻人，体格健壮，长相虽丑但待人诚恳，生了一个宽鼻和一头散乱的棕色粗发。“若是交给我办，我会带上一百精兵深入山区，把他们从窝里赶出来，好好教训一顿，可您妹妹不准。她连放手下骑士参加首相的比武大会都不准。说是要把所有的兵力都留在这儿，守护艾林谷……可谁也不清楚到底是要防备谁。有人说这是在捕风捉影。”他不安地看着她，仿佛突然想起她的身份。“夫人，希望我没说错话。我没有冒犯您的意思。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3083');"><p>"Frank talk does not offend me, Ser Donnel." Catelyn knew what her sister feared. Not shadows, Lannisters, she thought to herself, glancing back to where the dwarf rode beside Bronn. The two of them had grown thick as thieves since Chiggen had died. The little man was more cunning than she liked. When they had entered the mountains, he had been her captive, bound and helpless. What was he now? Her captive still, yet he rode along with a dirk through his belt and an axe strapped to his saddle, wearing the shadowskin cloak he’d won dicing with the singer and the chainmail hauberk he’d taken off Chiggen’s corpse. Two score men flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band, knights and men-at-arms in service to her sister Lysa and Jon Arryn’s young son, and yet Tyrion betrayed no hint of fear. Could I be wrong? Catelyn wondered, not for the first time. Could he be innocent after all, of Bran and Jon Arryn and all the rest? And if he was, what did that make her? Six men had died to bring him here.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3083" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“唐纳尔爵士，实话实说怎么会冒犯到我呢？”凯特琳知道妹妹怕的是什么。不是影子，而是兰尼斯特，她一边想着，一边回头瞄了一眼骑行在波隆身旁的侏儒。自从契根死后，他们俩便成了哥们儿。小个子的精明狡狯，让她颇感不悦，他们刚上山时，他是她的俘虏，五花大绑，求助无门，瞧瞧如今他变成什么样了？虽然依旧是她的囚徒，但骑着马，腰间斜插匕首，鞍上绑着大斧，肩头披了跟那歌手赌骰子赢来的山猫皮披风，身上穿着从契根尸体上取走的锁子甲。二十名骑士和士兵走在侏儒和她残败不堪的队伍两侧，他们都是她妹妹莱莎及琼恩•艾林幼子的忠仆，然而提利昂却连一点畏惧的神色也无。难道他真是无辜？难道他当真与布兰、琼恩•艾林以及其他事情无关？果真如此，那她又是怎么了？为了把他带来这里，六个人丢了性命。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3084');"><p>Resolute, she pushed her doubts away. "When we reach your keep, I would take it kindly if you could send for Maester Colemon at once. Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds." More than once she had feared the gallant old knight would not survive the journey. Toward the end he could scarcely sit his horse, and Bronn had urged her to leave him to his fate, but Catelyn would not hear of it. They had tied him in the saddle instead, and she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch over him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3084" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她毅然决然地抛开疑虑。“等我们到了你的要塞，如果你能立刻请柯蒙学士过来，我会非常感激。罗德利克爵士因为伤势的关系，高烧不退。”她不止一次担心这忠勇的老骑士撑不过这趟旅程。末了他已经几乎无法骑马，波隆力劝她任他自生自灭，但凯特琳不听。她反而令他们将他绑在鞍上，并吩咐歌手马瑞里安负责看护。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3085');"><p>Ser Donnel hesitated before he answered. "The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the Eyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert," he said. "We have a septon at the gate who tends to our wounded. He can see to your man’s hurts."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3085" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>唐纳尔爵士迟疑半晌才回答。“莱莎夫人下令要学士留在鹰巢城，以便随时照顾劳勃少主。”他说，“不过我们血门要塞有个修士负责处理伤患，他可以替您手下疗伤。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3086');"><p>Catelyn had more faith in a maester’s learning than a septon’s prayers. She was about to say as much when she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either side of them. Where the pass shrank to a narrow defile scarce wide enough for four men to ride abreast, twin watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes, joined by a covered bridge of weathered grey stone that arched above the road. Silent faces watched from arrow slits in tower, battlements, and bridge. When they had climbed almost to the top, a knight rode out to meet them. His horse and his armor were grey, but his cloak was the rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun, and a shiny black fish, wrought in gold and obsidian, pinned its folds against his shoulder. "Who would pass the Bloody Gate?" he called.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3086" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>相较于修士的祈祷，凯特琳对学士的医疗知识要有信心得多。她正准备说出心中想法，防御工事便已在前方出现。迤长的城垛建筑在两边危崖上，山路收缩到勉强只容四人并肩骑行，两座了望塔攀附于岩壁之上，彼此以一弯饱经风霜的灰石密闭拱桥相连。沉默的脸庞从塔中的舐箭孔、城垛和石桥间注视着他们。快到顶端时，一名骑士骑马过来迎接。他的坐骑和铠甲都是灰色，但披风却是奔流城抖擞的蓝红相间图案，一尾用黄金和黑曜石精工打造、闪闪发光的黑鱼镶在他肩头。“是谁要通过血门？”他喊道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3087');"><p>"Ser Donnel Waynwood, with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions," the young knight answered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3087" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“唐纳尔•韦伍德爵士，以及凯特琳夫人和她的同伴。”年轻骑士回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3088');"><p>The Knight of the Gate lifted his visor. "I thought the lady looked familiar. You are far from home, little Cat."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3088" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>血门骑士揭开面罩。“我就觉得眼前这位夫人面熟。小凯特，你离家可真远啊。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3089');"><p>"And you, Uncle," she said, smiling despite all she had been through. Hearing that hoarse, smoky voice again took her back twenty years, to the days of her childhood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3089" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“叔叔，您不也是？”虽然历经了一切苦难，她还是发自内心地微笑。听见那沙哑、如烟熏般的嗓音，仿佛时光倒流二十年，又把她带回到童年时光。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3090');"><p>"My home is at my back," he said gruffly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3090" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的家就在这里。”他粗鲁地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3091');"><p>"Your home is in my heart," Catelyn told him. "Take off your helm. I would look on your face again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3091" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你的家在我心里。”凯特琳告诉他，“把头盔拿下来，我想再好好看你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3092');"><p>"The years have not improved it, I fear," Brynden Tully said, but when he lifted off the helm, Catelyn saw that he lied. His features were lined and weathered, and time had stolen the auburn from his hair and left him only grey, but the smile was the same, and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars, and the laughter in his deep blue eyes. "Did Lysa know you were coming?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3092" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“只怕过了这些年，还是没好看到哪里去。”布林登•徒利虽然这么说，但当他揭起头盔时，凯特琳却认为他撒了谎。他的容貌虽然饱经风霜，岁月偷走了他的红褐头发，只留满头灰白，但他的笑容依旧，肥如毛虫的浓眉依旧，深邃蓝眼中的笑意依旧。“莱莎知道你要来吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3093');"><p>"There was no time to send word ahead," Catelyn told him. The others were coming up behind her. "I fear we ride before the storm, Uncle."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3093" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们事先来不及通知。”凯特琳告诉他。这时其他人也跟了上来。“叔叔，只怕风暴在我身后穷追不舍。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3094');"><p>"May we enter the Vale?" Ser Donnel asked. The Waynwoods were ever ones for ceremony.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3094" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们能进峡谷吗？”唐纳尔爵士问。韦伍德家的人向来讲究礼仪。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3095');"><p>"In the name of Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, True Warden of the East, I bid you enter freely, and charge you to keep his peace," Ser Brynden replied. "Come."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3095" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“以鹰巢城公爵、艾林谷守护者、真正的东境守护劳勃•艾林之名，我让你们通过，并要求你们以他之名维持和平。”布林登爵士回答，“走吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3096');"><p>And so she rode behind him, beneath the shadow of the Bloody Gate where a dozen armies had dashed themselves to pieces in the Age of Heroes. On the far side of the stoneworks, the mountains opened up suddenly upon a vista of green fields, blue sky, and snowcapped mountains that took her breath away. The Vale of Arryn bathed in the morning light.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3096" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是她骑马跟在他身边，穿过血门的阴影。英雄纪元时期，无数兵马命丧于此，却依然无法攻克峡谷。石砌工事彼端，峰峦骤然展开，绿野、蓝天和白雪皑皑的山尖骤然呈现，美得让她喘不过气。此刻，艾林谷正沐浴在晨光之中。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3097');"><p>It stretched before them to the misty cast, a tranquil land of rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the sun, protected on all sides by its sheltering peaks. Wheat and corn and barley grew high in its fields, and even in Highgarden the pumpkins were no larger nor the fruit any sweeter than here. They stood at the western end of the valley, where the high road crested the last pass and began its winding descent to the bottomlands two miles below. The Vale was narrow here, no more than a half day’s ride across, and the northern mountains seemed so close that Catelyn could almost reach out and touch them. Looming over them all was the jagged peak called the Giant’s Lance, a mountain that even mountains looked up to, its head lost in icy mists three and a half miles above the valley floor. Over its massive western shoulder flowed the ghost torrent of Alyssa’s Tears. Even from this distance, Catelyn could make out the shining silver thread, bright against the dark stone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3097" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>峡谷在他们面前绵延，直至氤氲弥漫的东方，这乃是一个祥和恬静的国度，四面受群山庇护，内中是肥沃的黑土，宽阔而舒缓的河川，还有在阳光下明亮如镜、数以百计的大小湖泊。田野间大麦、小麦和玉米结实累累，就连高庭所生产的南瓜也不比这里硕大，水果更不及此地甜美。他们走进峡谷西端，通过最后一道山口后，道路便开始蜿蜒向下，直至足足两里高的山脚下。此处峡谷甚窄，不需半日即可穿越，北边的山脉近在咫尺，凯特琳仿佛伸手可及。此地最高的山被称做“巨人之枪”，重重山脉都仰之弥高，它的山尖离地三里半，消失在冰冷的雾气之中。“阿莱莎之泪”幽魂般的激流自其高耸的西峦贯穿而下，即使距离如此遥远，凯特琳也分辨得出那条闪亮的银丝带，与暗色的磐石对比鲜明。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3098');"><p>When her uncle saw that she had stopped, he moved his horse closer and pointed. "It’s there, beside Alyssa’s Tears. All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then, if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3098" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>叔叔看见她停了下来，便策马靠过来指给她看。“就在那里，阿莱莎之泪旁边，如果你看得够仔细，阳光又恰好照到城墙，就能见到闪现的白光。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3099');"><p>Seven towers, Ned had told her, like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky, so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds. "How long a ride?" she asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3099" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>七座高塔，奈德曾经告诉她，如纯白的匕首刺进苍天的肚腹，耸立云天，站在城垛上，云层都在你脚下。“要走多久？”她问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3100');"><p>"We can be at the mountain by evenfall," Uncle Brynden said, "but the climb will take another day."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3100" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“今天傍晚我们可以抵达山下，”布林登叔叔道，“但上山还要再花去一天的时间。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3101');"><p>Ser Rodrik Cassel spoke up from behind. "My lady," he said, "I fear I can go no farther today." His face sagged beneath his ragged, newgrown whiskers, and he looked so weary Catelyn feared he might fall off his horse.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3101" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>后面的罗德利克•凯索爵士开了口，“夫人，”他说，“恐怕我今天没法再走下去。”他的脸塌成一团，新长的胡子参差不齐，看来非常虚弱，凯特琳真担心他会跌下马。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3102');"><p>"Nor should you," she said. "You have done all I could have asked of you, and a hundred times more. My uncle will see me the rest of the way to the Eyrie. Lannister must come with me, but there is no reason that you and the others should not rest here and recover your strength."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3102" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你本不该再走。”她说，“我所要求你做的，你不但尽数办到，还大大超出我的期望。我叔叔会陪我上鹰巢城，兰尼斯特必须跟我走，但你和其他人没有理由不留在这里好好休息，恢复元气。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3103');"><p>"We should be honored to have them to guest," Ser Donnel said with the grave courtesy of the young. Beside Ser Rodrik, only Bronn, Ser Willis Wode, and Marillion the singer remained of the party that had ridden with her from the inn by the crossroads.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3103" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“能招待他们作为宾客是我们的荣幸。”年轻的唐纳尔爵士努力严肃而依礼地说。除了罗德利克爵士，当初跟她一起从路口旅店出发的人，如今只剩波隆、维里•渥德爵士和歌手马瑞里安。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3104');"><p>"My lady," Marillion said, riding forward. "I beg you allow me to accompany you to the Eyrie, to see the end of the tale as I saw its beginnings." The boy sounded haggard, yet strangely determined; he had a fevered shine to his eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3104" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，”马瑞里安驱骑向前，“请您允许我也陪伴您到鹰巢城去，我看到了故事的开头，也想看看故事怎么结束。”男孩的声音虽然憔悴，却出奇坚决，眼里闪着热切的光芒。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3105');"><p>Catelyn had never asked the singer to ride with them; that choice he had made himself, and how he had come to survive the journey when so many braver men lay dead and unburied behind them, she could never say. Yet here he was, with a scruff of beard that made him look almost a man. Perhaps she owed him something for having come this far. "Very well," she told him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3105" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳原本就没有邀这名歌手同行，完全是他自作主张。至于为什么许多比他勇敢的人都弃尸荒野，他却活得好端端的，她就不得而知了。总之他在途中长了点胡碴，看起来多了点男人味道，他都走了这么远，或许她不该拒绝他。“好吧。”她对他说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3106');"><p>"I’ll come as well," Bronn announced.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3106" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我也去。”波隆表示。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3107');"><p>She liked that less well. Without Bronn she would never have reached the Vale, she knew; the sellsword was as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen, and his sword had helped cut them through to safety. Yet for all that, Catelyn misliked the man. Courage he had, and strength, but there was no kindness in him, and little loyalty. And she had seen him riding beside Lannister far too often, talking in low voices and laughing at some private joke. She would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now, but having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie, she could see no gracious way to deny that same right to Bronn. "As you wish," she said, although she noted that he had not actually asked her permission.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3107" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她更不喜欢他。要不是波隆，她绝不可能抵达艾林谷，这点她很清楚。这名佣兵是个极其剽悍的战士，他的剑为他们杀出一条血路。即便如此，凯特琳还是不喜欢这人。他有勇气，力量也不缺，但他心里没有仁慈二字，更别说忠诚。她时常看见他跟兰尼斯特骑行在一块儿，低语交谈，同声大笑。她原本打算当下就把他和侏儒隔离开，但既然答应让马瑞里安一起去鹰巢城，她实在没有合适的理由拒绝他。“随你的吧。”她说，却也发现他根本就没请求她同意。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3108');"><p>Ser Willis Wode remained with Ser Rodrik, a soft-spoken septon fussing over their wounds. Their horses were left behind as well, poor ragged things. Ser Donnel promised to send birds ahead to the Eyrie and the Gates of the Moon with the word of their coming. Fresh mounts were brought forth from the stables, surefooted mountain stock with shaggy coats, and within the hour they set forth once again. Catelyn rode beside her uncle as they began the descent to the valley floor. Behind came Bronn, Tyrion Lannister, Marillion, and six of Brynden’s men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3108" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>维里•渥德爵士和罗德利克爵士留了下来，由一位说话轻声细语的修士照料他们的伤势。他们那几匹憔悴不堪的马也被留下。唐纳尔爵士保证会先派鸟儿将他们到来的消息通知鹰巢城和月门堡。有人从马厩里牵来精力充沛、鬃毛蓬松而熟悉山路的马，他们只歇息不到一个小时便又再度上路，朝下方的谷地平原出发，凯特琳走在叔叔旁边，波垄提利昂•兰尼斯特、马瑞里安以及布林登的六名手下跟随在后。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3109');"><p>Not until they were a third of the way down the mountain path, well out of earshot of the others, did Brynden Tully turn to her and say, "So, child. Tell me about this storm of yours."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3109" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>直到他们走过三分之一的下山路，远离其他人的听力范围之后，布林登•徒利方才转向她说：“好吧，孩子，告诉我这场风暴是怎么回事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3110');"><p>"I have not been a child in many years, Uncle," Catelyn said, but she told him nonetheless. It took longer than she would have believed to tell it all, Lysa’s letter and Bran’s fall, the assassin’s dagger and Littlefinger and her chance meeting with Tyrion Lannister in the crossroads inn.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3110" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“叔叔，我早不是小孩子了。”凯特琳道。但她还是一五一十地告诉了他，虽然花的时间远远超出预期。她从莱莎的信、布兰坠楼、刺客的匕首、小指头，一直讲到她在岔路旅店与提利昂•兰尼斯特的巧遇。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3111');"><p>Her uncle listened silently, heavy brows shadowing his eyes as his frown grew deeper. Brynden Tully had always known how to listen?.?.?.?to anyone but her father. He was Lord Hoster’s brother, younger by five years, but the two of them had been at war as far back as Catelyn could remember. During one of their louder quarrels, when Catelyn was eight, Lord Hoster had called Brynden "the black goat of the Tully flock." Laughing, Brynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a leaping trout, so he ought to be a black fish rather than a black goat, and from that day forward he had taken it as his personal emblem.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3111" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>叔叔静静地听着，眉头越皱越深，浓厚的眉毛盖住了眼睛。布林登•徒利是个善于倾听的人……除非对象是她父亲。他是霍斯特公爵的弟弟，虽只相差五岁，但自凯特琳有记忆起，两人便已不和。凯特琳八岁时兄弟俩一场大吵，霍斯特公爵指责布林登是“徒利家的害群黑羊”，但布林登笑着说他们家族的辬志是跃出水面的鳟鱼，所以他应该是黑鱼，而非黑羊。从那天起，他便以此为纹章。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3112');"><p>The war had not ended until the day she and Lysa had been wed. It was at their wedding feast that Brynden told his brother he was leaving Riverrun to serve Lysa and her new husband, the Lord of the Eyrie. Lord Hoster had not spoken his brother’s name since, from what Edmure told her in his infrequent letters.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3112" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一直到她和莱莎出嫁那天，两人的纷争都没结束。布林登正是在婚宴上对他哥哥宣布自己要跟莱莎一起离开奔流城，去为她的新婚丈夫、鹰巢城公爵效命。据艾德慕偶尔写给她的信中所言，从那之后，霍斯特公爵再没提过弟弟的名字。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3113');"><p>Nonetheless, during all those years of Catelyn’s girlhood, it had been Brynden the Blackfish to whom Lord Hoster’s children had run with their tears and their tales, when Father was too busy and Mother too ill. Catelyn, Lysa, Edmure?.?.?.?and yes, even Petyr Baelish, their father’s ward?.?.?.?he had listened to them all patiently, as he listened now, laughing at their triumphs and sympathizing with their childish misfortunes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3113" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>虽然如此，在凯特琳的少女时代，每每父亲大人太忙，母亲大人又病得太重，霍斯特公爵的子女分享喜怒哀乐的对象，却是布林登叔叔。不论凯特琳，莱莎，还是艾德慕……噢，对了，即便父亲的养子培提尔•贝里席……他都耐心十足地侧耳倾听，为他们获得的成功同声欢笑，对他们幼臻惹来的麻烦表示同情，一如此刻。

Above that was another, higher and more distant, and still higher a third, no more than a flickering spark in the sky. And finally, up where the falcons soared, a flash of white in the moonlight.

Beyond was dense forest of pine and spruce, and the mountain like a black wall, but the steps were there, chiseled deep into the rock, ascending into the sky.

His family would arrange a more suitable match for him, to a Corbray or a Waynwood or a Royce, or perhaps a daughter of some greater house outside the Vale.

The trees pressed close, leaning over the path to make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon, so it seemed as though they were moving up a long black tunnel. But the mules were surefooted and tireless, and Mya Stone did indeed seem blessed with night-eyes. They plodded upward, winding their way back and forth across the face of the mountain as the steps twisted and turned. A thick layer of fallen needles carpeted the path, so the shoes of their mules made only the softest sound on the rock. The quiet soothed her, and the gentle rocking motion set Catelyn to swaying in her saddle. Before long she was fighting sleep.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3167" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>上山的过程比凯特琳原本期待的要轻松许多。森林离他们很近，伸展过来遮住山路，搭起一棚瑟瑟作响的青绿屋顶，连月光也被遮蔽，所以她们仿佛是在暗道里行进。但是骡子的步履稳健，毫无疲态，米亚•石东也的确如有夜视能力。山路蜿蜒崎岖，两人沿路缓步慢行，越过山壁。厚厚的松针铺在地上宛如绒毯，骡子走在石阶上只发出最细微的声音。这片宁静安抚了她的情绪，轻微的晃动让凯特琳在鞍上摇摇摆摆，没多久她就开始抗拒瞌睡的诱惑了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3168');"><p>Perhaps she did doze for a moment, for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming before them. "Stone," Mya announced cheerily, dismounting. Iron spikes were set along the tops of formidable stone walls, and two fat round towers overtopped the keep. The gate swung open at Mya’s shout. Inside, the portly knight who commanded the waycastle greeted Mya by name and offered them skewers of charred meat and onions still hot from the spit. Catelyn had not realized how hungry she was. She ate standing in the yard, as stablehands moved their saddles to fresh mules. The hot juices ran down her chin and dripped onto her cloak, but she was too famished to care.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3168" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>或许她真打了一阵盹吧，因为宏伟的镶铁城门突然便矗立在她们面前。“危岩堡到了。”米亚开心地跳下骡子宣布。坚实的石城墙顶插满铁钉，两个圆胖的塔楼环绕主堡。城门在米亚的呼喊下缓缓打开，负责指挥这座堡垒的骑士是个粗壮的家伙，他亲切地叫出米亚的名字，拿出刚从烤架上取下、虽有点焦但热腾腾的烧肉和烤洋葱招待她们。凯特琳早已忘记自己有多饿，站在中庭里就吃了起来，马夫则把她们的鞍鞫换到精力充沛的新骡子背上。温热的肉汁流过她的下巴，滴在披风上，但她实在太饿，便也管不了这许多。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3169');"><p>Then it was up onto a new mule and out again into the starlight. The second part of the ascent seemed more treacherous to Catelyn. The trail was steeper, the steps more worn, and here and there littered with pebbles and broken stone. Mya had to dismount a half-dozen times to move fallen rocks from their path. "You don’t want your mule to break a leg up here," she said. Catelyn was forced to agree. She could feel the altitude more now. The trees were sparser up here, and the wind blew more vigorously, sharp gusts that tugged at her clothing and pushed her hair into her eyes. From time to time the steps doubled back on themselves, and she could see Stone below them, and the Gates of the Moon farther down, its torches no brighter than candles.

Yet it nestled against the Giant’s Lance in such a way as to command the entire stone stair above the lower waycastle. An enemy intent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from Stone step by step, while rocks and arrows rained down from Snow above. The commander, an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face, offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves before his fire, but Mya declined. "We ought to keep going, my lady," she said. "If it please you." Catelyn nodded.

The stars seemed brighter up here, so close that she could almost touch them, and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky. As they climbed, Catelyn found it was better to look up than down. The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze and thaw and the tread of countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat. When they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock, Mya dismounted. "It’s best to lead the mules over," she said. "The wind can be a little scary here, my lady."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3174" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>雪山堡之上，强风是个活生生的事物，犹如荒野孤狼般在她们周围呼啸狂吼，时时又归于平静，仿佛有意诱使她们掉以轻心。从这里看去，星星似乎更亮，好似近在咫尺，触手可及。一弯新月挂在清朗的夜空中，显得硕大无朋。凯特琳只觉上山时往上看比往下看感觉好多了。经过几百年来的结冰、融雪和无以计数的骡蹄踩踏，石阶破损得相当厉害，即便是在黑暗中看不清，她依旧提心吊胆。当她们来到两座尖石间的平台时，米亚爬下骡子。“这里我们最好牵骡子过去，”她说，“夫人，请注意，这儿的风有点强。”

Yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear caught Catelyn in its jaws. She could feel the emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around her. She stopped, trembling, afraid to move. The wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak, trying to pull her over the edge. Catelyn edged her foot backward, the most timid of steps, but the mule was behind her, and she could not retreat. I am going to die here, she thought. She could feel cold sweat trickling down her back.

A mouth yawned in the rock face in front of them. "The stables and barracks are in there," Mya said. "The last part is inside the mountain. It can be a little dark, but at least you’re out of the wind. This is as far as the mules can go.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3196');"><p>Small wonder, Catelyn thought; Lysa had almost been shouting. Still, her sister looked daggers at her. "This is your aunt Catelyn, baby. My sister, Lady Stark. Do you remember?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3196" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这也难怪，凯特琳心想，因为莱莎刚才几乎就是在吼。妹妹看她的眼神依旧锐利如刀。“小宝贝，这是你凯特琳阿姨。她是我姐姐，史塔克夫人，你还记得吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3197');"><p>The boy glanced at her blankly. "I think so," he said, blinking, though he had been less than a year old the last time Catelyn had seen him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3197" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小男孩一脸茫然地看着她。“好像记得。”他眨着眼说。凯特琳上次见他时，他还未满周岁。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3198');"><p>Lysa seated herself near the fire and said, "Come to Mother, my sweet one." She straightened his bedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair. "Isn’t he beautiful? And strong too, don’t you believe the things you hear. Jon knew. The seed is strong, he told me. His last words. He kept saying Robert’s name, and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks. Tell them, the seed is strong. His seed. He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3198" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱莎在火炉边坐下。“小亲亲，到妈咪这儿来。”她整整他的睡衣，拨拨他的头发。“你看他漂不漂亮？其实他也很强壮，你别听信外边的传言。琼恩很清楚，他亲口对我说’种性强韧‘，这是他的临终遗言。他一直念叨着劳勃的名字，用力抓我的手，直到留下血痕。他是要我告诉他们，种性强韧，这是他的种，他要大家都知道我的小宝贝长大之后会变成个强壮的男子汉。”

</p></origin><translate id="div_3199" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“莱莎，”凯特琳道，“如果关于兰尼斯特家的情况属实，那我们应该赶紧采取行动。我们——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3200');"><p>"Not in front of the baby," Lysa said. "He has a delicate temper, don’t you, sweet one?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3200" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不要在我宝贝面前谈这些。”莱莎说，“他的脾气很纤细，对不对啊，小亲亲？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3201');"><p>"The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale," Catelyn reminded her, "and these are no times for delicacy. Ned thinks it may come to war."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3201" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这孩子是鹰巢城公爵，也是艾林谷的守护者。”凯特琳提醒她，“现在不是曲意温柔的时候。奈德认为依目前情势很可能会演变至战争。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3202');"><p>"Quiet!" Lysa snapped at her. "You’re scaring the boy." Little Robert took a quick peek over his shoulder at Catelyn and began to tremble. His doll fell to the rushes, and he pressed himself against his mother. "Don’t be afraid, my sweet baby," Lysa whispered. "Mother’s here, nothing will hurt you." She opened her robe and drew out a pale, heavy breast, tipped with red. The boy grabbed for it eagerly, buried his face against her chest, and began to suck. Lysa stroked his hair.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3202" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“闭嘴！”莱莎怒叱。“你吓到孩子了。”小劳勃从她肩头偷偷望了凯特琳一眼，然后发起抖来。他的玩偶掉到地毯上，他则紧紧抱住母亲。“我亲爱的小宝贝，别怕喔。”莱莎轻声说，“妈咪在这里，不会有事的。”她掀开睡袍，拉出一只苍白但涨鼓鼓、奶头红润的乳房。男孩渴切地抓住它，把头埋在她胸口，吸吮了起来。莱莎抚弄着他的头发。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3203');"><p>Catelyn was at a loss for words. Jon Arryn’s son, she thought incredulously. She remembered her own baby, three-year-old Rickon, half the age of this boy and five times as fierce. Small wonder the lords of the Vale were restive. For the first time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away from his mother to foster with the Lannisters?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_3203" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳说不出话来。这竟然是琼恩•艾林的儿子，她难以置信地想。她想起了自己的小儿子，瑞肯才三岁，年纪只有这男孩的一半，却精力旺盛，足以当他好几倍有余。难怪艾林谷的诸侯们焦虑不安。她终于了解到国王为何要把这孩子从母亲身边带开，交给兰尼斯特家抚养……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3204');"><p>"We’re safe here," Lysa was saying. Whether to her or to the boy, Catelyn was not sure.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3204" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在这里，我们不会有事。”莱莎说。至于这话究竟是对她说，还是对那孩子说，凯特琳无法确定。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3205');"><p>"Don’t be a fool," Catelyn said, the anger rising in her. "No one is safe. If you think hiding here will make the Lannisters forget you, you are sadly mistaken."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3205" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别傻了，”凯特琳道，怒意陡然从心中升起。“现在哪里都不安全。你以为躲在这里，兰尼斯特家就会忘记你的存在吗？你真是大错特错！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3206');"><p>Lysa covered her boy’s ear with her hand. "Even if they could bring an army through the mountains and past the Bloody Gate, the Eyrie is impregnable. You saw for yourself. No enemy could ever reach us up here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3206" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱莎伸手捂住男孩的耳朵。“就算他们带兵杀进崇山峻岭，穿过血门，也不可能攻破鹰巢城。你自己也看到了，没有人能攻到这里。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3207');"><p>Catelyn wanted to slap her. Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her, she realized. "No castle is impregnable."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3207" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳有种想甩她耳光的冲动。布林登叔叔试图警告她，她这才明白原因何在。“世上没有攻不破的城堡。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3208');"><p>"This one is," Lysa insisted. "Everyone says so. The only thing is, what am I to do with this Imp you have brought me?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3208" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这座城堡就攻不破。”莱莎坚持，“而且每个人都知道。现在惟一的问题是，我该怎么处置你带来的这个小恶魔？”
