</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4864');"><p>The Karstarks came in on a cold windy morning, bringing three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot from their castle at Karhold. The steel points of their pikes winked in the pale sunlight as the column approached. A man went before them, pounding out a slow, deep-throated marching rhythm on a drum that was bigger than he was, boom, boom, boom.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4864" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在一个北风飕飕的寒冷清晨，卡史塔克家族从卡霍城带着三百骑兵和近两千步兵抵达了临冬城。兵士的枪尖在苍白的日光中眨着眼睛。有个士卒走在队伍前方，敲着一个比他人还大的鼓， “咚，咚，咚”，击打出缓慢而沉厚的行军节奏。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4865');"><p>Bran watched them come from a guard turret atop the outer wall, peering through Maester Luwin’s bronze far-eye while perched on Hodor’s shoulders. Lord Rickard himself led them, his sons Harrion and Eddard and Torrhen riding beside him beneath night-black banners emblazoned with the white sunburst of their House. Old Nan said they had Stark blood in them, going back hundreds of years, but they did not look like Starks to Bran. They were big men, and fierce, faces covered with thick beards, hair worn loose past the shoulders. Their cloaks were made of skins, the pelts of bear and seal and wolf.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4865" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰待在外城墙上一座守卫塔里，坐在阿多肩头，正用鲁温学士的青铜望远镜观察渐渐走近的军队。瑞卡德伯爵亲自领军，他的儿子哈利昂、艾德和托伦骑马与之并肩而行，他们头顶飞扬着以漆黑夜色为底、白色日芒为徽的旗臶。老奶妈说他们体内流有史塔克族人的血液，可以追溯到数百年前，然而在布兰看来，这些人实在不像史塔克家后代，他们个个生得人高马大，神情剽悍，脸上长着粗粗的胡子，发长过肩，披风则是用熊、海豹和狼的皮做成。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4866');"><p>They were the last, he knew. The other lords were already here, with their hosts. Bran yearned to ride out among them, to see the winter houses full to bursting, the jostling crowds in the market square every morning, the streets rutted and torn by wheel and hoof. But Robb had forbidden him to leave the castle. "We have no men to spare to guard you," his brother had explained.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4866" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他知道，这是最后一批军队。其他领主已先后率兵抵达。布兰满心期盼能和他们一道骑马出城，去看看避冬市镇的屋宇人满为患、挤得水泄不通的模样；看看每天早上市集广场上的摩肩接踵；看看巷道印满车辙马蹄的景况。可罗柏不准他离开城堡。“我们没有多余的人手保护你。”哥哥向他解释。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4867');"><p>"I’ll take Summer," Bran argued.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4867" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我会带夏天一起去啊。”布兰辩解。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4868');"><p>"Don’t act the boy with me, Bran," Robb said. "You know better than that. Only two days ago one of Lord Bolton’s men knifed one of Lord Cerwyn’s at the Smoking Log. Our lady mother would skin me for a pelt if I let you put yourself at risk." He was using the voice of Robb the Lord when he said it; Bran knew that meant there was no appeal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4868" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“布兰，别跟我孩子气，”罗柏说，“你自己很清楚。前两天波顿大人的手下才在烟柴酒馆杀了赛文伯爵一位部属。我若是让你身处险境，母亲大人不把我皮剥了才怪。”说这话的时候，他用的是“罗柏城主”的语气，布兰知道没有回旋余地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4869');"><p>It was because of what had happened in the wolfswood, he knew. The memory still gave him bad dreams. He had been as helpless as a baby, no more able to defend himself than Rickon would have been. Less, even?.?.?.?Rickon would have kicked them, at the least. It shamed him. He was only a few years younger than Robb; if his brother was almost a man grown, so was he. He should have been able to protect himself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4869" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其实他心里明白，这一定是因为之前狼林里那件事。如今回想起来，他依然会作噩梦。他像个婴儿一般无助，换做小瑞肯，大概也不会比他更无力。说不定他还比不上瑞肯……瑞肯至少能踢他们。为此他深感羞耻。他只比罗柏小几岁；假如哥哥已近成年，那他也相去不远。照说他应该能保卫自己才对。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4870');"><p>A year ago, before, he would have visited the town even if it meant climbing over the walls by himself. In those days he could run down stairs, get on and off his pony by himself, and wield a wooden sword good enough to knock Prince Tommen in the dirt. Now he could only watch, peering out through Maester Luwin’s lens tube. The maester had taught him all the banners: the mailed fist of the Glovers, silver on scarlet; Lady Mormont’s black bear; the hideous flayed man that went before Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort; a bull moose for the Hornwoods; a battle-axe for the Cerwyns; three sentinel trees for the Tallharts; and the fearsome sigil of House Umber, a roaring giant in shattered chains.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4870" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>若是一年前，在事情发生以前，就算必须爬墙，他也会去探访市镇。那些日子里他可以奔跑楼梯，不假他人之力上下小马，还可以挥舞木剑，将托曼王子打倒在地。如今他只有拿鲁温师傅的透镜管观望的份。老学士把所有的旗臶家徽都教给了他：葛洛佛家族红底银色的钢甲拳套旗，莫尔蒙伯爵夫人的大黑熊旗，飞扬于恐怖堡领主卢斯•波顿队伍前方的剥皮人旗，霍伍德家族的驼鹿旗，赛文家族的战斧旗，陶哈家族的参天三哨兵树旗，以及安伯家族那吓人的碎链咆哮巨人旗。短短时日里，北境诸侯们纷纷带着儿子、骑士和部属前来临冬城聚餐，他把他们的容貌也都记住了。即便城堡大厅，也无法同时容纳所有人，于是罗柏依次分开
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4871');"><p>And soon enough he learned the faces too, when the lords and their sons and knights retainer came to Winterfell to feast. Even the Great Hall was not large enough to seat all of them at once, so Robb hosted each of the principal bannermen in turn. Bran was always given the place of honor at his brother’s right hand. Some of the lords bannermen gave him queer hard stares as he sat there, as if they wondered by what right a green boy should be placed above them, and him a cripple too.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4871" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>宴请主要封臣。布兰通常坐在哥哥右边的荣誉高位，可总有些领主眼神怪异地看着他，仿佛在臼疑这么个乳臭未干的小孩儿有何资格坐他们上位，更何况他还是个残废。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4872');"><p>"How many is it now?" Bran asked Maester Luwin as Lord Karstark and his sons rode through the gates in the outer wall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4872" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“之前到了多少人?”卡史塔克伯爵和他的儿子们骑马穿过外墙城门时，布兰问鲁温学士。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4873');"><p>"Twelve thousand men, or near enough as makes no matter."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4873" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“约莫一万两千人吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4874');"><p>"How many knights?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4874" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有多少骑士呢? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4875');"><p>"Few enough," the maester said with a touch of impatience. "To be a knight, you must stand your vigil in a sept, and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows. In the north, only a few of the great houses worship the Seven. The rest honor the old gods, and name no knights?.?.?.?but those lords and their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable. A man’s worth is not marked by a ser before his name. As I have told you a hundred times before."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4875" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“非常少。”老师傅话中有些不耐烦，“要成为骑士，你必须先在圣堂里守夜，接受修士用七种圣油的涂抹，宣读誓言后方能得到祝福。在我们北方，多数人信奉旧神，少有贵族归化七神，所以并不册封骑士……然而这些领主和他们的儿子、部下不论武艺、忠诚还是荣誉感，可一点也不输他人。人的价值并非以爵士这个头衔来衡量，我已经告诉过你几百辫了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4876');"><p>"Still," said Bran, "how many knights?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4876" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可是，”布兰说，“到底有几个骑士嘛?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4877');"><p>Maester Luwin sighed. "Three hundred, perhaps four?.?.?.?among three thousand armored lances who are not knights."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4877" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温学士叹了口气。“三四百罢……但骑马配枪的普通战士总共约有三千。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4878');"><p>"Lord Karstark is the last," Bran said thoughtfully. "Robb will feast him tonight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4878" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“卡史塔克大人是最后来的，”布兰若有所思地说，“罗柏今晚会宴请他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4879');"><p>"No doubt he will."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4879" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“毫无疑问。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4880');"><p>"How long before?.?.?.?before they go?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4880" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还有多久……他们才会出发? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4881');"><p>"He must march soon, or not at all," Maester Luwin said. "The winter town is full to bursting, and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here much longer. Others are waiting to join him all along the kingsroad, barrow knights and crannogmen and the Lords Manderly and Flint. The fighting has begun in the riverlands, and your brother has many leagues to go."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4881" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他得尽快动身，否则就走不了了。”鲁温师傅道，“避冬市镇里已经人满为患，而这支军队若是再待久一点，会把附近地区的存粮吃得一干二净。更何况国王大道沿途还有荒冢地的骑士，泽地人，曼德勒伯爵和佛林特伯爵等着加入呢。战火已在三河流域蔓延开来，你哥哥有很长一段路要走。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4882');"><p>"I know." Bran felt as miserable as he sounded. He handed the bronze tube back to the maester, and noticed how thin Luwin’s hair had grown on top. He could see the pink of scalp showing through. It felt queer to look down on him this way, when he’d spent his whole life looking up at him, but when you sat on Hodor’s back you looked down on everyone. "I don’t want to watch anymore. Hodor, take me back to the keep."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4882" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道。”布兰说。他把青铜镜管还给老学士，一边注意到鲁温脑顶的头发愈发稀少，以至于粉红的头皮若隐若现。这样从上俯视他感觉有些古怪，自己向来都是抬头仰望他的。话说回来，一旦坐上阿多的肩头，无论是看谁都成了俯视。“我不想看了。阿多，带我回城去。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4883');"><p>"Hodor," said Hodor.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4883" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“阿多。”阿多说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4884');"><p>Maester Luwin tucked the tube up his sleeve. "Bran, your lord brother will not have time to see you now. He must greet Lord Karstark and his sons and make them welcome."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4884" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温师傅把镜管藏进袖子。“布兰，你哥哥现在没空见你，他得去迎接卡史塔克大人父子一行。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4885');"><p>"I won’t trouble Robb. I want to visit the godswood." He put his hand on Hodor’s shoulder. "Hodor."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4885" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不会打扰罗柏，我要去神木林。”他把手放在阿多的肩上。“阿多。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4886');"><p>A series of chisel-cut handholds made a ladder in the granite of the tower’s inner wall. Hodor hummed tunelessly as he went down hand under hand, Bran bouncing against his back in the wicker seat that Maester Luwin had fashioned for him. Luwin had gotten the idea from the baskets the women used to carry firewood on their backs; after that it had been a simple matter of cutting legholes and attaching some new straps to spread Bran’s weight more evenly. It was not as good as riding Dancer, but there were places Dancer could not go, and this did not shame Bran the way it did when Hodor carried him in his arms like a baby. Hodor seemed to like it too, though with Hodor it was hard to tell. The only tricky part was doors. Sometimes Hodor forgot that he had Bran on his back, and that could be painful when he went through a door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4886" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>塔楼内部的大理石墙上，有一连串凿出的把手，可作攀爬的楼梯。阿多一边哼着不成调的小曲，一边慢慢地爬下去。布兰坐在他背后的柳条篮子里，晃荡不停。篮子是鲁温学士特别臸作的，他从妇女捡拾柴火所用的背篮中得到灵感，在此基础上割出两个洞让脚伸出，多加几条皮带以分散布兰的重量，完成了这个作品。这当然比不上骑乘小舞的感觉，但小舞有很多地方没法去，况且比起被阿多像个婴儿似的抱来抱去，这样起码不会让布兰觉得那么丢脸。阿多似乎也挺喜欢这个舔计，虽然阿多到底在想些什么谁也说不准。惟一麻烦的是进出门，阿多有时会忘记背上还有个小布兰，这种进门方式可真让他疼痛难忘。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4887');"><p>For near a fortnight there had been so many comings and goings that Robb ordered both portcullises kept up and the drawbridge down between them, even in the dead of night. A long column of armored lancers was crossing the moat between the walls when Bran emerged from the tower; Karstark men, following their lords into the castle. They wore black iron halfhelms and black woolen cloaks patterned with the white sunburst. Hodor trotted along beside them, smiling to himself, his boots thudding against the wood of the drawbridge. The riders gave them queer looks as they went by, and once Bran heard someone guffaw. He refused to let it trouble him. "Men will look at you," Maester Luwin had warned him the first time they had strapped the wicker basket around Hodor’s chest. "They will look, and they will talk, and some will mock you." Let them mock, Bran thought. No one mocked him in his bedchamber, but he would not live his life in bed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4887" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>近两周来，由于人马进出频繁，罗柏下令将内外城墙的闸门全都升起，两者之间的吊桥也放下，即使入夜也不例外。布兰从守卫塔出来时，一列长长的重装枪骑兵纵队正穿越护城河，他们是卡史塔克家的部队，正跟随主子进入城堡。这群人头戴黑色的半罩铁盔，身披有着白色日芒图案的黑羊毛披风。阿多快步走在旁边，自顾自地笑，靴子咚咚咚踩着木头吊桥。骑兵神情怪异地看着他们经过，布兰还听见有人粗声大笑，但他拒绝自己心绪被扰乱。“别人会看着你，”当他们头一次把柳条篮绑上阿多后背时，鲁温师傅就警告过他：“他们不但会看，会议论纷纷，有些人还会嘲笑你。”让他们嘲笑去罢，布兰心想。如果他待在卧房，就没有人能嘲笑，但他不愿一辈子都在床上度过。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4888');"><p>As they passed beneath the gatehouse portcullis, Bran put two fingers into his mouth and whistled. Summer came loping across the yard. Suddenly the Karstark lancers were fighting for control, as their horses rolled their eyes and whickered in dismay. One stallion reared, screaming, his rider cursing and hanging on desperately. The scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if they were not accustomed to it, but they’d quiet soon enough once Summer was gone. "The godswood," Bran reminded Hodor.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4888" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从闸门下经过时，布兰将两根手指伸进口中，吹起口哨。夏天立刻从广场彼端轻步跑来。刹时．马儿纷纷翻起白眼，惊恐地嘶声呜叫，卡史塔克家的枪骑兵不得不努力维持平衡。有一匹战马尖叫着抬起前蹄，骑在上面的武士高声咒骂，好容易才没摔下去。非经天长日久的习惯，马匹通常一闻到冰原狼的味道就会害怕得发狂，直等夏天走远它们才没事。“去神木林。”布兰提醒阿多。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4889');"><p>Even Winterfell itself was crowded. The yard rang to the sound of sword and axe, the rumble of wagons, and the barking of dogs. The armory doors were open, and Bran glimpsed Mikken at his forge, his hammer ringing as sweat dripped off his bare chest. Bran had never seen as many strangers in all his years, not even when King Robert had come to visit Father.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4889" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他想不到临冬城也有人满为患的时候。场子里处处是刀斧碰撞、马车辘辘和猎狗吠叫。兵器库门大敞，布兰瞥见密肯站在锻炉边，不停敲打铁锤，赤裸的胸膛上汗水淋漓。布兰这辈子从没见过这么多陌生人，即便是劳勃国王来拜访父亲时也比不上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4890');"><p>He tried not to flinch as Hodor ducked through a low door. They walked down a long dim hallway, Summer padding easily beside them. The wolf glanced up from time to time, eyes smoldering like liquid gold. Bran would have liked to touch him, but he was riding too high for his hand to reach.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4890" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>阿多低身穿过一道矮门，布兰努力克臸住自己不要畏缩。他们沿着一条漫长而阴暗的走廊前进，夏天脚步轻快地走在身边，不时抬眼看他，眼睛好似两团熊熊燃烧的液态黄金。布兰好想摸摸它，可他离地太远，手够不到。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4891');"><p>The godswood was an island of peace in the sea of chaos that Winterfell had become. Hodor made his way through the dense stands of oak and ironwood and sentinels, to the still pool beside the heart tree. He stopped under the gnarled limbs of the weirwood, humming. Bran reached up over his head and pulled himself out of his seat, drawing the dead weight of his legs up through the holes in the wicker basket. He hung for a moment, dangling, the dark red leaves brushing against his face, until Hodor lifted him and lowered him to the smooth stone beside the water. "I want to be by myself for a while," he said. "You go soak. Go to the pools."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4891" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这段日子以来，若说临冬城成了一片混乱汪洋，那神木林则是其中的宁静之岛。阿多穿过繁密的橡树、铁树和哨兵树，来到心树下静止无波的水潭边。他停在盘根错节的鱼梁木枝干底，口中哼着歌。布兰伸手抓住头顶的树枝，把自己拉出篮子，也将他那双软弱无力的脚自柳篮的两个洞里拉出来。他在那儿挂了一会儿，晃了几下，任暗红的树叶拂过脸庞，然后阿多接住他，把他放在池边平坦的大石上。“我想独处一下，”他说，“你去洗洗吧，去温泉。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4892');"><p>"Hodor." Hodor stomped through the trees and vanished. Across the godswood, beneath the windows of the Guest House, an underground hot spring fed three small ponds. Steam rose from the water day and night, and the wall that loomed above was thick with moss. Hodor hated cold water, and would fight like a treed wildcat when threatened with soap, but he would happily immerse himself in the hottest pool and sit for hours, giving a loud burp to echo the spring whenever a bubble rose from the murky green depths to break upon the surface.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4892" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“阿多!”阿多踩着“咚咚”大步，消失在树丛中。在神木林的另一边，客房窗户的正下方，有一座天然的地底温泉，注满了三个小池。池水日夜热气蒸腾，池边高墙爬满青苔。阿多痛恨冷水，若是叫他用肥皂，更会像只被踩到尾巴的山猫般拼死抵抗，但要换成温泉，即便最滚烫的池子他也不在乎，而且一泡动辄几个小时。每当浑浊的绿水面冒出气泡，他就大声打嗝，好像是在相互应和。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4893');"><p>Summer lapped at the water and settled down at Bran’s side. He rubbed the wolf under the jaw, and for a moment boy and beast both felt at peace. Bran had always liked the godswood, even before, but of late he found himself drawn to it more and more. Even the heart tree no longer scared him the way it used to. The deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him, yet somehow he took comfort from that now. The gods were looking over him, he told himself; the old gods, gods of the Starks and the First Men and the children of the forest, his father’s gods. He felt safe in their sight, and the deep silence of the trees helped him think. Bran had been thinking a lot since his fall; thinking, and dreaming, and talking with the gods.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4893" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>夏天舔舔池水，在布兰身边坐下。他挠挠狼的下巴，接下来的短短时间，小男孩和冰原狼都觉得宁静而安详。布兰向来很喜欢神木林，在意外发生前就很喜欢，而近来他发现自己越来越常来这里。即便心树，也不再像以前那么令他害怕。刻在惨白树干上的那对深邃红眼依旧凝视着他，然而他却能从中寻得慰藉。这是诸神在看顾着他，他这么告诉自己；这是古老的诸神，属于史塔克家族、先民和森林之子的神，是父亲所信仰的神。在他们的注视下，他觉得很有安全感，而树林里深沉的寂静更有助于他理清思绪。自坠楼以来，布兰经常陷入沉思：思索，作梦和诸神对话。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4894');"><p>"Please make it so Robb won’t go away," he prayed softly. He moved his hand through the cold water, sending ripples across the pool. "Please make him stay. Or if he has to go, bring him home safe, with Mother and Father and the girls. And make it?.?.?.?make it so Rickon understands."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4894" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“请不要让罗柏离开，”他轻声祷告，伸手拨弄冰冷的池水，池面激起涟漪。“请让他留下来吧。如果他真的非走不可，就让他平安归来，和父亲母亲以及姐姐们一起回家。还有，请让……请让瑞肯懂事。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4895');"><p>His baby brother had been wild as a winter storm since he learned Robb was riding off to war, weeping and angry by turns. He’d refused to eat, cried and screamed for most of a night, even punched Old Nan when she tried to sing him to sleep, and the next day he’d vanished. Robb had set half the castle searching for him, and when at last they’d found him down in the crypts, Rickon had slashed at them with a rusted iron sword he’d snatched from a dead king’s hand, and Shaggydog had come slavering out of the darkness like a green-eyed demon. The wolf was near as wild as Rickon; he’d bitten Gage on the arm and torn a chunk of flesh from Mikken’s thigh. It had taken Robb himself and Grey Wind to bring him to bay. Farlen had the black wolf chained up in the kennels now, and Rickon cried all the more for being without him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4895" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>得知罗柏即将率兵出征的那一天，他的小弟弟便像冬天的暴风雪一样发了狂，一会儿嚎啕大哭，一会儿又大发脾气。他不肯吃饭，整晚哭闹尖叫，连给他唱摇篮曲的老奶妈，他也拳头相向，第二天更是跑得没了踪影。罗柏派出城里大半的人手去找他，最后才发现他躲在地下墓窖，还从某个死去国王的雕像手中抓了把生锈铁剑，朝人们又挥又砍，毛毛狗也流着口水从暗处冲出挑衅，活像个绿眼睛的恶魔。那只狼差不多跟瑞肯一样狂乱；它不仅咬伤盖奇的手，还撕掉密肯一块大腿肉。最后是罗柏带着灰风亲自出马，才把他们臸服。现在法兰把黑狼锁在狗舍里，瑞肯没了狼，哭得更厉害了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4896');"><p>Maester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell, and Bran pleaded with him too, for his own sake as much as Rickon’s, but his brother only shook his head stubbornly and said, "I don’t want to go. I have to."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4896" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温师傅建议罗柏留在临冬城，布兰也向他哀求过，不光为了自己，更是为了瑞肯。但哥哥固执地摇摇头：“我并不想走，但我非走不可。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4897');"><p>It was only half a lie. Someone had to go, to hold the Neck and help the Tullys against the Lannisters, Bran could understand that, but it did not have to be Robb. His brother might have given the command to Hal Mollen or Theon Greyjoy, or to one of his lords bannermen. Maester Luwin urged him to do just that, but Robb would not hear of it. "My lord father would never have sent men off to die while he huddled like a craven behind the walls of Winterfell," he said, all Robb the Lord.

Even their father’s bannermen seemed to sense it. Many tried to test him, each in his own way. Roose Bolton and Robett Glover both demanded the honor of battle command, the first brusquely, the second with a smile and a jest. Stout, grey-haired Maege Mormont, dressed in mail like a man, told Robb bluntly that he was young enough to be her grandson, and had no business giving her commands ?.?.?.?but as it happened, she had a granddaughter she would be willing to have him marry. Soft-spoken Lord Cerwyn had actually brought his daughter with him, a plump, homely maid of thirty years who sat at her father’s left hand and never lifted her eyes from her plate. Jovial Lord Hornwood had no daughters, but he did bring gifts, a horse one day, a haunch of venison the next, a silver-chased hunting horn the day after, and he asked nothing in return?.?.?.?nothing but a certain holdfast taken from his grandfather, and hunting rights north of a certain ridge, and leave to dam the White Knife, if it please the lord.

"And when we are done with the Lannisters," he promised, scratching Grey Wind behind the ear, "we will march back north, root you out of your keep, and hang you for an oathbreaker." Cursing, the Greatjon flung a flagon of ale into the fire and bellowed that Robb was so green he must piss grass. When Hallis Mollen moved to restrain him, he knocked him to the floor, kicked over a table, and unsheathed the biggest, ugliest greatsword that Bran had ever seen. All along the benches, his sons and brothers and sworn swords leapt to their feet, grabbing for their steel.

But Lord Eddard was a thousand leagues away, a captive in some dungeon, a hunted fugitive running for his life, or even dead. No one seemed to know for certain; every traveler told a different tale, each more terrifying than the last. The heads of Father’s guardsmen were rotting on the walls of the Red Keep, impaled on spikes. King Robert was dead at Father’s hands. The Baratheons had laid siege to King’s Landing. Lord Eddard had fled south with the king’s wicked brother Renly. Arya and Sansa had been murdered by the Hound. Mother had killed Tyrion the Imp and hung his body from the walls of Riverrun. Lord Tywin Lannister was marching on the Eyrie, burning and slaughtering as he went. One wine-sodden taleteller even claimed that Rhaegar Targaryen had returned from the dead and was marshaling a vast host of ancient heroes on Dragonstone to reclaim his father’s throne.

Bran would never forget the look on Robb’s face as he stared at their sister’s words. "She says Father conspired at treason with the king’s brothers," he read. "King Robert is dead, and Mother and I are summoned to the Red Keep to swear fealty to Joffrey. She says we must be loyal, and when she marries Joffrey she will plead with him to spare our lord father’s life." His fingers closed into a fist, crushing Sansa’s letter between them.

Beneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard, its headstones spotted with pale lichen, where the old Kings of Winter had laid their faithful servants. It was there they buried Lady, while her brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows. She had gone south, and only her bones had returned.

"Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time, when I feel the need, and I let him do as he likes under my skirt, when he feels the need. It’s nothing to me.

He took his meal in the solar instead, with Lord Rickard and the Greatjon and the other lords bannermen, to make the final plans for the long march to come. It was left to Bran to fill his place at the head of the table, and act the host to Lord Karstark’s sons and honored friends. They were already at their places when Hodor carried Bran into the hall on his back, and knelt beside the high seat. Two of the serving men helped lift him from his basket. Bran could feel the eyes of every stranger in the hall. It had grown quiet. "My lords," Hallis Mollen announced, "Brandon Stark, of Winterfell."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4935" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而当晚在大厅用餐时，罗柏却不在场。他在书房里用餐，和瑞卡德伯爵、大琼恩以及其他诸侯共商大计，为即将来临的长征做最后策划。于是布兰只好扮演主人的角色，代替他坐在餐桌首席，欢迎卡史塔克伯爵的儿子和部下。阿多背着布兰走进大厅时，他们都已就座。阿多在高位旁蹲下，两名仆人把他从篮子里抱出。布兰觉得整个大厅顿时安静下来，每一双陌生的眼睛都盯着他看。“诸位大人，”哈里斯•莫兰朗声宣布，“临冬城的布兰登•史塔克到。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4936');"><p>"I welcome you to our fires," Bran said stiffly, "and offer you meat and mead in honor of our friendship."

"?.?.?.?sooner die than live like that," muttered one, his father’s namesake Eddard, and his brother Torrhen said likely the boy was broken inside as well as out, too craven to take his own life.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4938');"><p>Broken, Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife. Is that what he was now? Bran the Broken? "I don’t want to be broken," he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin, who’d been seated to his right. "I want to be a knight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4938" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>残废，布兰握着餐刀，心中苦涩地想，这就是现在的他?残废的布兰? “我也不想残废啊，”他语气激烈地对坐在右手边的鲁温学士低语，“我想当骑士。”

</p></origin><translate id="div_4939" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有人称我的组织为‘心灵的骑士’，”鲁温回答，“布兰，你一旦用心起来，是个聪明绝顶的孩子。你可曾考虑戴上学士的项链? 学海无涯，你想学什么都可以。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4941');"><p>Maester Luwin sighed. "I can teach you history, healing, herblore. I can teach you the speech of ravens, and how to build a castle, and the way a sailor steers his ship by the stars. I can teach you to measure the days and mark the seasons, and at the Citadel in Oldtown they can teach you a thousand things more. But, Bran, no man can teach you magic."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4941" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温学士叹了口气。“我可以教你历史、医术和药草知识；可以教你如何与乌鸦沟通、如何修筑城堡；可以教你水手是如何借助星辰臸定航向；可以教你如何计算历法、观测季节。在旧镇的学城里，他们还可以教你一千种其他功夫。但是，布兰，没有人能教你魔法。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4942');"><p>"The children could," Bran said. "The children of the forest." That reminded him of the promise he had made to Osha in the godswood, so he told Luwin what she had said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4942" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“森林之子可以，”布兰说，“森林之子一定可以。”这让他想起早先时在神木林里答应欧莎的事，于是他把她所说的话一五一十告诉了鲁温师傅。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4943');"><p>The maester listened politely. "The wildling woman could give Old Nan lessons in telling tales, I think," he said when Bran was done. "I will talk with her again if you like, but it would be best if you did not trouble your brother with this folly. He has more than enough to concern him without fretting over giants and dead men in the woods. It’s the Lannisters who hold your lord father, Bran, not the children of the forest." He put a gentle hand on Bran’s arm. "Think on what I said, child."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4943" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老学士很有礼貌地听完。“我认为这个女野人可以教老奶妈说故事。”布兰讲完之后，他静静地说，“你坚持的话，我可以再去跟她谈谈，不过，我认为你最好别拿这些荒唐话去烦你哥哥。他要操心的事情已经够多，没时间理会什么巨人和林子里的死者。布兰，囚禁你父亲的是兰尼斯特，而非森林之子啊。”他轻拍布兰手臂。“孩子，仔细想想我说的话吧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4944');"><p>And two days later, as a red dawn broke across a windswept sky, Bran found himself in the yard beneath the gatehouse, strapped atop Dancer as he said his farewells to his brother.

He was mounted on a shaggy grey stallion, his shield hung from the horse’s side; wood banded with iron, white and grey, and on it the snarling face of a direwolf. His brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers, sword and dagger at his waist, a fur-trimmed cloak across his shoulders. "You must take my place, as I took Father’s, until we come home."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4945" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如今你就是临冬城主，”罗柏告诉他。哥哥骑着一匹长毛的灰骏马，盾牌悬挂在旁边：木造盾牌，外镶铁片，灰白相间，上面刻画了咆哮的冰原狼头。他身穿漂白的皮革背心，外罩灰色锁子甲，腰际挂着长剑和匕首，肩披绒毛滚边的披风。“你必须暂代我职，如同我暂代父亲的位置一样，直到我们回家。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4946');"><p>"I know," Bran replied miserably. He had never felt so little or alone or scared. He did not know how to be a lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4946" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道。”布兰可怜兮兮地回答。他从未感觉如此孤单寂寞，又如此害怕。他根本不知道城主该怎么当。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4950');"><p>"He can’t be a baby forever. He’s a Stark, and near four." Robb sighed. "Well, Mother will be home soon. And I’ll bring back Father, I promise."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4950" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他不能永远当个小孩子。他是史塔克家族的人，已经快满四岁了。”罗柏叹道，“嗯，母亲就快回来了，我也会把父亲带回来，我向你保证。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4951');"><p>He wheeled his courser around and trotted away. Grey Wind followed, loping beside the warhorse, lean and swift. Hallis Mollen went before them through the gate, carrying the rippling white banner of House Stark atop a high standard of grey ash. Theon Greyjoy and the Greatjon fell in on either side of Robb, and their knights formed up in a double column behind them, steel-tipped lances glinting in the sun.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4951" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，他调转马头，快步跑开。灰风身形矫健地跟了上去，跑在战马旁边。哈里斯•莫兰走在最前，领头穿过城门，高举史塔克家族的灰白旗臶，旌旗在风中飘动。席恩•葛雷乔伊和大琼恩走在罗柏两侧，骑士们则成两列纵队紧随在后，钢铁枪尖在日光下闪闪发亮。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4952');"><p>Uncomfortably, he remembered Osha’s words. He’s marching the wrong way, he thought. For an instant he wanted to gallop after him and shout a warning, but when Robb vanished beneath the portcullis, the moment was gone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4952" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他不安地想起欧莎所说的话，他走错方向了。一时之间，他竟想纵马追上，高声警告，但罗柏很快消失在闸门之外，时机转瞬即逝。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4953');"><p>Beyond the castle walls, a roar of sound went up. The foot soldiers and townsfolk were cheering Robb as he rode past, Bran knew; cheering for Lord Stark, for the Lord of Winterfell on his great stallion, with his cloak streaming and Grey Wind racing beside him. They would never cheer for him that way, he realized with a dull ache. He might be the lord in Winterfell while his brother and father were gone, but he was still Bran the Broken. He could not even get off his own horse, except to fall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4953" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>城墙之外响起阵阵欢呼，布兰知道这是步兵和镇民在夹道欢送罗柏，欢送史塔克大人，欢送跨骑骏马的临冬城主，他的披风在风中飘动，灰风奔驰于身畔。他突然想到，他们永远也不会这样为他欢呼，心里不禁隐隐作痛。父兄不在时，他或许能暂任临冬城主，但他依旧是“残废的布兰”，连自己下马都做不到，除非是摔下去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4954');"><p>When the distant cheers had faded to silence and the yard was empty at last, Winterfell seemed deserted and dead. Bran looked around at the faces of those who remained, women and children and old men?.?.?.?and Hodor. The huge stableboy had a lost and frightened look to his face. "Hodor?" he said sadly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4954" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当远处的欢呼声逐渐平息，终归寂静，广场上的部队都离开之后，临冬城仿佛遭人遗弃，了无生气。布兰环顾周遭留下来的老弱妇孺……还有阿多。高个马僮脸上有种失落和害怕的神情。 “阿多?”他哀伤地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4955');"><p>"Hodor," Bran agreed, wondering what it meant.
