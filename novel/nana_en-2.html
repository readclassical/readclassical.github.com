</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_192');"><p>At ten o'clock the next morning Nana was still asleep. She occupied the second floor of a large new house in the Boulevard Haussmann, the landlord of which let flats to single ladies in order by their means to dry the paint. A rich merchant from Moscow, who had come to pass a winter in Paris, had installed her there after paying six months' rent in advance. The rooms were too big for her and had never been completely furnished. The vulgar sumptuosity of gilded consoles and gilded chairs formed a crude contrast therein to the bric-a-brac of a secondhand furniture shop—to mahogany round tables, that is to say, and zinc candelabras, which sought to imitate Florentine bronze. All of which smacked of the courtesan too early deserted by her first serious protector and fallen back on shabby lovers, of a precarious first appearance of a bad start, handicapped by refusals of credit and threats of eviction.
</p></origin><translate id="div_192" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>第二天早上十点钟，娜娜还在睡觉。她住在奥斯曼大街的一座高大的新房子的第三层楼上。房东把它租给一些单身女子，让她们当新房子的第一批房客。一个莫斯科富商来到巴黎过冬，替娜娜预付了六个月房租，把她安顿在那里。这套房子对她来说，显得太大了，里面的家具从来没有配齐全过，陈设豪华而刺眼，几张金色的蜗形脚桌子和几张椅子与从旧货商那里买来的旧货棗几张独脚桃花心木小圆桌、几盏模仿佛罗伦萨青铜制品的锌制菱形大烛台摆在一起，显得很不协调。这令人联想到她早就被第一个正经丈夫抛弃了，后来又落到一些行为不端的情人手中。可谓旗开失利，第一次下海就遭失败，告贷无门，又受到被人赶出住宅的威胁。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_193');"><p>Nana was sleeping on her face, hugging in her bare arms a pillow in which she was burying cheeks grown pale in sleep. The bedroom and the dressing room were the only two apartments which had been properly furnished by a neighboring upholsterer. A ray of light, gliding in under a curtain, rendered visible rosewood furniture and hangings and chairbacks of figured damask with a pattern of big blue flowers on a gray ground. But in the soft atmosphere of that slumbering chamber Nana suddenly awoke with a start, as though surprised to find an empty place at her side. She looked at the other pillow lying next to hers; there was the dint of a human head among its flounces: it was still warm. And groping with one hand, she pressed the knob of an electric bell by her bed's head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_193" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜趴着睡觉，两只赤裸的胳膊抱着枕头，睡得发白的脸埋在枕头里。整套住宅里，只有卧室和盥洗室两个房间经过本区一个装潢工人精心装潢过。一道熹微的光线从窗帘下射进来，照亮了卧室内的红木家具、帷幔和罩着锦缎套椅子，锦缎的底色是灰色的，上面绣着一朵朵大蓝花。在这间沉睡、空气湿润的房间里，娜娜突然醒来，仿佛感到身边空空的，顿时大吃一惊。她瞧瞧枕头旁边的另一只枕头，在镂空花边枕套中间，还留下人头压陷了的痕迹，她用手摸摸，还有点热呢。随后，她用一只手摸索着，揿了一下床头的电铃。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_194');"><p>"He's gone then?" she asked the maid who presented herself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_194" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他走了吗？”她问进来的贴身女仆。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_195');"><p>"Yes, madame, Monsieur Paul went away not ten minutes back. As Madame was tired, he did not wish to wake her. But he ordered me to tell Madame that he would come tomorrow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_195" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对，保尔先生走了，还不到十分钟……因为太太很疲劳，他不想惊醒您。他让我转告太太，他明天就回来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_196');"><p>As she spoke Zoe, the lady's maid, opened the outer shutter. A flood of daylight entered. Zoe, a dark brunette with hair in little plaits, had a long canine face, at once livid and full of seams, a snub nose, thick lips and two black eyes in continual movement.
</p></origin><translate id="div_196" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>贴身女仆佐爱一边说，一边打开百叶窗，一大片阳光射进来。佐爱长着一头深棕色的头发，头上扎着许多小头带，一副长长的脸，嘴巴长得像狗，脸色苍白，脸上有条长长的疤痕，扁鼻子，厚嘴唇，两只黑眼睛滴溜溜转个不停。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_197');"><p>"Tomorrow, tomorrow," repeated Nana, who was not yet wide awake, "is tomorrow the day?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_197" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“明天，明天，”睡眼瞢瞢的娜娜重复道，“明天是该他来的日子吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_198');"><p>"Yes, madame, Monsieur Paul has always come on the Wednesday."
</p></origin><translate id="div_198" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对，太太，保尔先生总是星期三来的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_199');"><p>"No, now I remember," said the young woman, sitting up. "It's all changed. I wanted to tell him so this morning. He would run against the nigger! We should have a nice to-do!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_199" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗳，不对，我想起来了！”年轻女人坐起来，大声嚷道，“情况都变了。我本来想今天早上告诉他的……他如果星期三来，就会碰上那个黑鬼。我们可就麻烦喽！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_200');"><p>"Madame did not warn me; I couldn't be aware of it," murmured Zoe. "When Madame changes her days she will do well to tell me so that I may know. Then the old miser is no longer due on the Tuesday?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_200" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太事先没有对我说，我没法子知道，”佐爱喃喃地说，“如果太太更改日期，最好事先告诉我一下，好让我知道…… 那么，那个老吝啬鬼就不是星期二来喽？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_201');"><p>Between themselves they were wont thus gravely to nickname as "old miser" and "nigger" their two paying visitors, one of whom was a tradesman of economical tendencies from the Faubourg Saint-Denis, while the other was a Walachian, a mock count, whose money, paid always at the most irregular intervals, never looked as though it had been honestly come by. Daguenet had made Nana give him the days subsequent to the old miser's visits, and as the trader had to be at home by eight o'clock in the morning, the young man would watch for his departure from Zoes kitchen and would take his place, which was still quite warm, till ten o'clock. Then he, too, would go about his business. Nana and he were wont to think it a very comfortable arrangement.
</p></origin><translate id="div_201" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她们两人私下里一本正经地用“老吝啬鬼”和“黑鬼”两个绰号来称呼两个花钱买嫖的男人，其中，一个是圣德尼郊区的商人，天生吝啬；另一人是瓦拉几亚①人，自称是公爵，他从未按时付过钱，而且钱的来路不明。达盖内叫娜娜把他自己的日期安排在老吝啬鬼的后一天，因为那个商人在第二天早上八点钟，必须回到自己家里。这样，达盖内就可以在佐爱的厨房里窥伺着，等老吝啬鬼一走，就钻进他的暖烘烘的被窝里，一直睡到十点钟；然后，他再去办自己的事情。娜娜和他都认为这样安排很合适。  
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_202');"><p>"So much the worse," said Nana; "I'll write to him this afternoon. And if he doesn't receive my letter, then tomorrow you will stop him coming in."
</p></origin><translate id="div_202" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“算了！”娜娜说，“今天下午我写信给他……如果他收不到我的信，明天他来了，你就拦住他，不让他进来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_203');"><p>In the meantime Zoe was walking softly about the room. She spoke of yesterday's great hit. Madame had shown such talent; she sang so well! Ah! Madame need not fret at all now!
</p></origin><translate id="div_203" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时候，佐爱在卧室内轻轻地走着。她谈起前一天演出的巨大成功。太太表现了出色的天才，她唱得多么好！啊！太太现在可以放心了！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_204');"><p>Nana, her elbow dug into her pillow, only tossed her head in reply. Her nightdress had slipped down on her shoulders, and her hair, unfastened and entangled, flowed over them in masses.
</p></origin><translate id="div_204" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜把胳膊肘抵在枕头上，一声没吭，只点头作答。她的睡衣滑了下来，头发松开，乱蓬蓬的，披散在双肩上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_205');"><p>"Without doubt," she murmured, becoming thoughtful; "but what's to be done to gain time? I'm going to have all sorts of bothers today. Now let's see, has the porter come upstairs yet this morning?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_205" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“也许吧，”娜娜露出沉思的样子，悄声说道，“可是怎么等得及呀？今天我会碰到种种麻烦事……喂，今天早上，门房上过楼没有？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_206');"><p>Then both the women talked together seriously. Nana owed three quarters' rent; the landlord was talking of seizing the furniture. Then, too, there was a perfect downpour of creditors; there was a livery-stable man, a needlewoman, a ladies' tailor, a charcoal dealer and others besides, who came every day and settled themselves on a bench in the little hall. The charcoal dealer especially was a dreadful fellow—he shouted on the staircase. But Nana's greatest cause of distress was her little Louis, a child she had given birth to when she was sixteen and now left in charge of a nurse in a village in the neighborhood of Rambouillet. This woman was clamoring for the sum of three hundred francs before she would consent to give the little Louis back to her. Nana, since her last visit to the child, had been seized with a fit of maternal love and was desperate at the thought that she could not realize a project, which had now become a hobby with her. This was to pay off the nurse and to place the little man with his aunt, Mme Lerat, at the Batignolles, whither she could go and see him as often as she liked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_206" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，两个女人就一本正经地聊起来。娜娜欠了三期房金，房东扬言要扣押她的财产。另外，她还有一大群债主：一个马车出租人，一个洗衣妇，一个裁缝，一个卖煤的，还有其他人。他们每天都来，来了就坐在前厅的一张长凳上不走。她最怕的是那个卖煤的，他上楼梯时就大声嚷叫。但是，娜娜最伤心的事还是她十六岁时生的男孩小路易，她把他留在朗布依埃附近的一个村子里，请一个奶娘照管。奶娘要她付三百法郎才肯让她把小路易带回来。上次她去看望孩子后，大发母爱之心，头脑里产生一个想法，还清奶娘的帐，把孩子放到住在巴蒂尼奥勒的姑妈勒拉太太的家里，这样，她随时都可去看孩子，可是她现在不能实现这个计划，感到非常失望。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_207');"><p>Meanwhile the lady's maid kept hinting that her mistress ought to have confided her necessities to the old miser.
</p></origin><translate id="div_207" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时候，贴身女仆提示她，说她早该把经济拮据情况告诉老吝啬鬼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_208');"><p>"To be sure, I told him everything," cried Nana, "and he told me in answer that he had too many big liabilities. He won't go beyond his thousand francs a month. The nigger's beggared just at present; I expect he's lost at play. As to that poor Mimi, he stands in great need of a loan himself; a fall in stocks has cleaned him out—he can't even bring me flowers now."
</p></origin><translate id="div_208" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“唉！这情况我跟他说过了，”娜娜大声说，“他对我说，他有几大笔到期的票据要付款。他给我的钱，每个月都不超过一千法郎……另外，那个黑鬼吧，现在身上连一个子儿也没有；我想他是赌输了……至于那个可怜的咪咪，他还急需向别人借钱呢；股票价格暴跌，他的钱损失得一干二净，连买花送我的钱都没有。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_209');"><p>She was speaking of Daguenet. In the self-abandonment of her awakening she had no secrets from Zoe, and the latter, inured to such confidences, received them with respectful sympathy. Since Madame condescended to speak to her of her affairs she would permit herself to say what she thought. Besides, she was very fond of Madame; she had left Mme Blanche for the express purpose of taking service with her, and heaven knew Mme Blanche was straining every nerve to have her again! Situations weren't lacking; she was pretty well known, but she would have stayed with Madame even in narrow circumstances, because she believed in Madame's future. And she concluded by stating her advice with precision. When one was young one often did silly things. But this time it was one's duty to look alive, for the men only thought of having their fun. Oh dear, yes! Things would right themselves. Madame had only to say one word in order to quiet her creditors and find the money she stood in need of.
</p></origin><translate id="div_209" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她说的是达盖内。她刚醒来，朦朦胧胧的，竟对佐爱吐露了真情。佐爱对这些知心话也听惯了，听时总是恭恭敬敬，对她还带着几分同情。既然太太愿同她谈知心话，她就大胆说出自己的真心话。首先，因为她很喜欢太太，所以才特意离开布朗瑟太太，天晓得布朗瑟太太动了多少脑筋想把她要回去！她相当有名气，不愁找不到活干！但是她要留在太太家里，即使太太现在经济有些拮据，因为她相信将来会好起来的。最后，她把自己的建议说得更明显了。一个人在年轻的时候，往往会干些蠢事。可是这一次，太太应当看清楚了，因为男人们只考虑寻欢作乐。啊！太太很快就会如愿以偿！只要太太说一句话，债主们就会消气了，她所需要的钱也就有了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_210');"><p>"All that doesn't help me to three hundred francs," Nana kept repeating as she plunged her fingers into the vagrant convolutions of her back hair. "I must have three hundred francs today, at once! It's stupid not to know anyone who'll give you three hundred francs."
</p></origin><translate id="div_210" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这番话一点不错，但现在不能给我弄来三百法郎，”娜娜重复道，一边把手指头插进她散乱的发髻里，“今天我就需要三百法郎，而且马上就要……连一个弄到三百法郎的人都不认识，真无用！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_211');"><p>She racked her brains. She would have sent Mme Lerat, whom she was expecting that very morning, to Rambouillet. The counteraction of her sudden fancy spoiled for her the triumph of last night. Among all those men who had cheered her, to think that there wasn't one to bring her fifteen louis! And then one couldn't accept money in that way! Dear heaven, how unfortunate she was! And she kept harking back again to the subject of her baby—he had blue eyes like a cherub's; he could lisp "Mamma" in such a funny voice that you were ready to die of laughing!
</p></origin><translate id="div_211" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她思索着。她本来约好早上等勒拉太太来，让她到朗布依埃去接孩子。现在她临时想出的计划落空了，昨天晚上的成功，她觉得也没有味道了。在所有向她喝彩的男人当中，竟然没有一个人能给她十五个金路易①！再说，我也不能白白接受别人的钱。天呀！她是多么不幸呀！她在谈话中，总是离不开孩子。她的孩子有一双碧蓝眼睛，像小天使，他才牙牙学语： “妈妈”，声音是那么逗人，真笑死人！  
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_212');"><p>But at this moment the electric bell at the outer door was heard to ring with its quick and tremulous vibration. Zoe returned, murmuring with a confidential air:
</p></origin><translate id="div_212" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在这时候，大门上的电铃响了，铃声急促颤抖着。佐爱出去看了又回来，神色神秘地说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_213');"><p>"It's a woman."
</p></origin><translate id="div_213" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是个女人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_214');"><p>She had seen this woman a score of times, only she made believe never to recognize her and to be quite ignorant of the nature of her relations with ladies in difficulties.
</p></origin><translate id="div_214" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这个女人佐爱见过多次了，可是她装作从来不认识，也不知道她与那些手头拮据的女人之间的关系。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_215');"><p>"She has told me her name—Madame Tricon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_215" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她把名字告诉我了……她是拉特里贡太太。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_216');"><p>"The Tricon," cried Nana. "Dear me! That's true. I'd forgotten her. Show her in."
</p></origin><translate id="div_216" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“拉特里贡太太！”娜娜大声说，“喂！真是她，我早把她忘记了……请她进来吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_217');"><p>Zoe ushered in a tall old lady who wore ringlets and looked like a countess who haunts lawyers' offices. Then she effaced herself, disappearing noiselessly with the lithe, serpentine movement wherewith she was wont to withdraw from a room on the arrival of a gentleman. However, she might have stayed. The Tricon did not even sit down. Only a brief exchange of words took place.
</p></origin><translate id="div_217" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佐爱领进来的老太太，高高的个子，满头鬈发，模样像一个使诉讼代理人厌烦的伯爵夫人。随后，佐爱不见了，她不声不响地走了，她从房间出去的动作像水蛇一样敏捷，如同来了一个男客，她立刻退出房间一样。不过，她不走也无妨，因为拉特里贡太太连凳子都没坐，她只同太太说了几句话。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_218');"><p>"I have someone for you today. Do you care about it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_218" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“今天，我给你介绍一个客人……你同意吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_219');"><p>"Yes. How much?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_219" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“同意……多少钱？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_220');"><p>"Twenty louis."
</p></origin><translate id="div_220" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“二十个金路易。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_221');"><p>"At what o'clock?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_221" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“几点钟来？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_222');"><p>"At three. It's settled then?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_222" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“三点钟来……那么，就这样定了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_223');"><p>"It's settled."
</p></origin><translate id="div_223" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就这样定了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_224');"><p>Straightway the Tricon talked of the state of the weather. It was dry weather, pleasant for walking. She had still four or five persons to see. And she took her departure after consulting a small memorandum book. When she was once more alone Nana appeared comforted. A slight shiver agitated her shoulders, and she wrapped herself softly up again in her warm bedclothes with the lazy movements of a cat who is susceptible to cold. Little by little her eyes closed, and she lay smiling at the thought of dressing Louiset prettily on the following day, while in the slumber into which she once more sank last night's long, feverish dream of endlessly rolling applause returned like a sustained accompaniment to music and gently soothed her lassitude.
</p></origin><translate id="div_224" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>尔后，拉特里贡太太说起天气，她说现在天气很干燥，出去走走倒挺惬意的。她还要去拜访四五个人，她翻开一本小笔记本，看了看就走了。剩下娜娜一个人，她似乎松了口气。她的肩膀轻轻哆嗦了一下，接着又钻进暖和和的被窝里，她那副懒洋洋的样子，活像一只怕冷的猫。她慢慢闭上了眼睛，一想到第二天把小路易穿得漂漂亮亮的，脸上不禁露出了笑颜。她又入睡了，像昨天晚上一样，她又作起狂热的梦，梦中一片经久不息的喝彩声，持续很久的雷鸣般的喝彩声，犹如低沉的音乐伴奏，轻轻消除她的倦意。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_225');"><p>At eleven o'clock, when Zoe showed Mme Lerat into the room, Nana was still asleep. But she woke at the noise and cried out at once:
</p></origin><translate id="div_225" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>到了十一点钟，佐爱带着勒拉太太进来了，这时娜娜还是在睡觉。不过，她一听到声音就醒了，马上说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_226');"><p>"It's you. You'll go to Rambouillet today?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_226" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是你呀……今天你到朗布依埃去吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_227');"><p>"That's what I've come for," said the aunt. "There's a train at twenty past twelve. I've got time to catch it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_227" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我就是为这事来的，”姑妈说，“十二点二十分有一趟火车。我乘这班车还赶得上。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_228');"><p>"No, I shall only have the money by and by," replied the young woman, stretching herself and throwing out her bosom. "You'll have lunch, and then we'll see."
</p></origin><translate id="div_228" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不行，我要到今天下午才有钱。”少妇伸个懒腰，挺着胸脯说道，“你先吃午饭吧，其他事等等再说。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_229');"><p>Zoe brought a dressing jacket.
</p></origin><translate id="div_229" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佐爱拿来一件晨衣。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_230');"><p>"The hairdresser's here, madame," she murmured.
</p></origin><translate id="div_230" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太，”她悄声说，“理发师来了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_231');"><p>But Nana did not wish to go into the dressing room. And she herself cried out:
</p></origin><translate id="div_231" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可是娜娜不肯到梳妆室去理发。她亲自叫道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_232');"><p>"Come in, Francis."
</p></origin><translate id="div_232" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“进来吧，弗朗西斯。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_233');"><p>A well-dressed man pushed open the door and bowed. Just at that moment Nana was getting out of bed, her bare legs in full view. But she did not hurry and stretched her hands out so as to let Zoe draw on the sleeves of the dressing jacket. Francis, on his part, was quite at his ease and without turning away waited with a sober expression on his face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_233" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一位衣冠整齐的男人推门进来，他鞠了一个躬。这时，恰好娜娜光着腿从床上下来。她不慌不忙伸出手，让佐爱把晨衣的袖子套上。弗朗西斯呢，却神态自如，表情严肃，站在那里等待着，并未转过头去。接着，她坐下来，他用梳子梳第一下时，就说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_234');"><p>"Perhaps Madame has not seen the papers. There's a very nice article in the Figaro."
</p></origin><translate id="div_234" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太大概没有看报吧……《费加罗报》上登了一篇很好的文章。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_235');"><p>He had brought the journal. Mme Lerat put on her spectacles and read the article aloud, standing in front of the window as she did so. She had the build of a policeman, and she drew herself up to her full height, while her nostrils seemed to compress themselves whenever she uttered a gallant epithet. It was a notice by Fauchery, written just after the performance, and it consisted of a couple of very glowing columns, full of witty sarcasm about the artist and of broad admiration for the woman.
</p></origin><translate id="div_235" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他买了一份《费加罗报》。勒拉太太戴上眼镜，站在窗户前，大声诵读那篇文章。她的身子像警察那样挺得笔直；她每读一个美丽的形容词，鼻子就收缩一下。这是一篇专栏评论文章，是福什利看了戏后写的，篇幅占了整整两栏，文章的措辞热烈，作为演员，他对娜娜进行了幽默的讽刺；作为女人，他却大加赞赏。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_236');"><p>"Excellent!" Francis kept repeating.
</p></origin><translate id="div_236" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“妙极了！”弗朗西斯连声叫道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_237');"><p>Nana laughed good-humoredly at his chaffing her about her voice! He was a nice fellow, was that Fauchery, and she would repay him for his charming style of writing. Mme Lerat, after having reread the notice, roundly declared that the men all had the devil in their shanks, and she refused to explain her self further, being fully satisfied with a brisk allusion of which she alone knew the meaning. Francis finished turning up and fastening Nana's hair. He bowed and said:
</p></origin><translate id="div_237" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>文章中讽刺她的嗓音，娜娜满不在乎！这个福什利，为人倒挺好；他对她这样好，她是一定要报答的。勒拉太太把那篇文章又念了一遍，接着，她宣称道：所有男人的腿肚里都藏着魔鬼；她不愿对这句轻薄的讽喻作解释，意思只有她一个人知道。弗朗西斯把娜娜的头发撩起来，然后扎好。他鞠了个躬，说道：

The notice warmed their hearts. Nana, who up till now had been half asleep, was again seized with the fever of her triumph. Dear, dear, 'twas Rose Mignon that would be spending a pleasant morning! Her aunt having been unwilling to go to the theater because, as she averred, sudden emotions ruined her stomach, Nana set herself to describe the events of the evening and grew intoxicated at her own recital, as though all Paris had been shaken to the ground by the applause. Then suddenly interrupting herself, she asked with a laugh if one would ever have imagined it all when she used to go traipsing about the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or. Mme Lerat shook her head. No, no, one never could have foreseen it! And she began talking in her turn, assuming a serious air as she did so and calling Nana "daughter." Wasn't she a second mother to her since the first had gone to rejoin Papa and Grandmamma? Nana was greatly softened and on the verge of tears. But Mme Lerat declared that the past was the past—oh yes, to be sure, a dirty past with things in it which it was as well not to stir up every day. She had left off seeing her niece for a long time because among the family she was accused of ruining herself along with the little thing. Good God, as though that were possible! She didn't ask for confidences; she believed that Nana had always lived decently, and now it was enough for her to have found her again in a fine position and to observe her kind feelings toward her son. Virtue and hard work were still the only things worth anything in this world.

At the mention of this sum the aunt forgot herself and shrieked to her niece, bidding her squeeze their throats, since she had them in her grasp. She was meaning the men, of course. Then they both embraced again, but in the midst of her rejoicing Nana's face, as she led the talk back to the subject of Louiset, seemed to be overshadowed by a sudden recollection.

She simply asked her why she hadn't come into the bedroom.

Mme Lerat's presence seemed to fidget her at first. Afterward, when she became aware that it was Nana's aunt, she looked at her with a sweet expression and a die-away smile. In the meantime Nana, who averred that she was as hungry as a wolf, threw herself on the radishes and gobbled them up without bread. Mme Lerat had become ceremonious; she refused the radishes as provocative of phlegm. By and by when Zoe had brought in the cutlets Nana just chipped the meat and contented herself with sucking the bones. Now and again she scrutinized her old friend's hat out of the corners of her eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_249" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她是马卢瓦太太，举止庄重，看上去很受人尊敬。她是娜娜的老年朋友，平时陪伴她，外出时陪她一起走。起初，勒拉太太在场似乎使她忐忑不安。后来她得知勒拉太太是娜娜的姑妈，便淡淡一笑，用温和的目光打量她。这时，娜娜说她肚子饿得咕咕叫，立即拿起小红萝卜，还没等到面包端上来，就大口大口嚼起来。勒拉太太变得讲究礼节起来，她不愿吃萝卜，说吃萝卜会生痰。不一会，佐爱端来排骨，娜娜小口小口地吃肉，却津津有味地吸骨髓。她不时用眼角瞟瞟她朋友的帽子。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_252');"><p>The hat was smart to distraction. In front it was greatly exaggerated, and it was adorned with a lofty feather. Mme Maloir had a mania for doing up all her hats afresh; she alone knew what really became her, and with a few stitches she could manufacture a toque out of the most elegant headgear. Nana, who had bought her this very hat in order not to be ashamed of her when in her company out of doors, was very near being vexed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_252" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这顶帽子的样子很古怪，前面的帽边很宽大，帽顶上插着一根长长的羽毛。马卢瓦太太有一种怪癖，她的新帽子都要改制一番；只有她自己知道什么样的帽子对她才合适。转瞬间，她就把一顶漂亮的帽子改成一顶鸭舌帽。娜娜当初给她买这顶帽子，是为了带她出去时不给自己丢脸，现在帽子改成这样子，她差点发起火来。她嚷道：

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_256');"><p>Dessert took a long time. Zoe did not remove the cloth before serving the coffee. Indeed, the ladies simply pushed back their plates before taking it. They talked continually of yesterday's charming evening. Nana kept rolling cigarettes, which she smoked, swinging up and down on her backward-tilted chair. And as Zoe had remained behind and was lounging idly against the sideboard, it came about that the company were favored with her history. She said she was the daughter of a midwife at Bercy who had failed in business. First of all she had taken service with a dentist and after that with an insurance agent, but neither place suited her, and she thereupon enumerated, not without a certain amount of pride, the names of the ladies with whom she had served as lady's maid. Zoe spoke of these ladies as one who had had the making of their fortunes. It was very certain that without her more than one would have had some queer tales to tell. Thus one day, when Mme Blanche was with M. Octave, in came the old gentleman. What did Zoe do? She made believe to tumble as she crossed the drawing room; the old boy rushed up to her assistance, flew to the kitchen to fetch her a glass of water, and M. Octave slipped away.

Both ladies took lumps of sugar dipped in cognac and sucked them. But Mme Maloir was wont to listen to other people's secrets without even confessing anything concerning herself. People said that she lived on a mysterious allowance in a room whither no one ever penetrated.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_261');"><p>Without thinking about it Mme Lerat had crossed two knives on the table in front of her. Notwithstanding this, the young woman defended herself from the charge of superstition. Thus, if the salt were upset, it meant nothing, even on a Friday; but when it came to knives, that was too much of a good thing; that had never proved fallacious. There could be no doubt that something unpleasant was going to happen to her. She yawned, and then with an air, of profound boredom:
</p></origin><translate id="div_261" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>勒拉太太刚才无意中把两把刀子摆成十字架形状。虽然娜娜不承认自己迷信。例如，盐打翻了，她不以为然，星期五干什么事情也不忌讳，但是刀子就厉害了，从来没有不应验的。毫无疑问，她会遇到一件不愉快的事情。她打了一个呵欠，然后，带着惴惴不安的神态说道：

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_263');"><p>The two old ladies looked at one another. The three women shook their heads without speaking. To be sure, life was not always amusing. Nana had tilted her chair back anew and lit a cigarette, while the others sat pursing up their lips discreetly, thinking deeply philosophic thoughts.
</p></origin><translate id="div_263" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两位老太太你瞧瞧我，我瞧瞧你。三个人点了点头，没吭一声。确实，生活中不是每件事都称心的。娜娜又把背靠在椅背上，又点燃一支烟，两个老太婆很知趣，抿着嘴唇，一声不吭。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_264');"><p>"While waiting for you to return we'll play a game of bezique," said Mme Maloir after a short silence. "Does Madame play bezique?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_264" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你出去吧，我们来打一会牌，我们等你回来。”马卢瓦太太沉默良久，说道，“这位老太太会打牌吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_265');"><p>Certainly Mme Lerat played it, and that to perfection. It was no good troubling Zoe, who had vanished—a corner of the table would do quite well. And they pushed back the tablecloth over the dirty plates. But as Mme Maloir was herself going to take the cards out of a drawer in the sideboard, Nana remarked that before she sat down to her game it would be very nice of her if she would write her a letter. It bored Nana to write letters; besides, she was not sure of her spelling, while her old friend could turn out the most feeling epistles. She ran to fetch some good note paper in her bedroom. An inkstand consisting of a bottle of ink worth about three sous stood untidily on one of the pieces of furniture, with a pen deep in rust beside it. The letter was for Daguenet. Mme Maloir herself wrote in her bold English hand, "My darling little man," and then she told him not to come tomorrow because "that could not be" but hastened to add that "she was with him in thought at every moment of the day, whether she were near or far away."
</p></origin><translate id="div_265" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当然，勒拉太太不但会打牌，而且打得很好。佐爱已经出去了，用不着麻烦她了；只要桌子的一块角落就够了；于是，她们把台布往上一撩，把脏碟子盖住。但是，在马卢瓦太太去拿碗橱抽屉里的牌时，娜娜说，在打牌之前，马卢瓦太太若替她写一封信，就帮了她的忙了。娜娜很怕写信，另外，她对单词也拼不准，而她的老朋友能写出热情洋溢的信。她到房间里找了一些好信纸，一张桌子上放着价值三个苏的一瓶墨水，一支积了墨锈的羽笔。这封信是写给达盖内的，马卢瓦太太不问娜娜一句，便用斜体字写道：“我亲爱的小男人”，接着告诉他明天不要来，因为“明天来不行”；但是，“不管他在远处还是在近处，她时时刻刻都在惦念着他。”

She had just been talking with the theater messenger, who had brought her mistress the day's playbill and rehearsal arrangements, which he had forgotten in the morning. Nana had this individual ushered in and got him to take the latter to Daguenet on his return. Then she put questions to him. Oh yes! M. Bordenave was very pleased; people had already taken seats for a week to come; Madame had no idea of the number of people who had been asking her address since morning. When the man had taken his departure Nana announced that at most she would only be out half an hour. If there were any visitors Zoe would make them wait. As she spoke the electric bell sounded. It was a creditor in the shape of the man of whom she jobbed her carriages. He had settled himself on the bench in the anteroom, and the fellow was free to twiddle his thumbs till night—there wasn't the least hurry now.

</p></origin><translate id="div_287" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佐爱又来了，她发觉她们在一股劲儿打牌。大伙沉默了一阵子，勒拉太太洗牌时，马卢瓦太太问道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_288');"><p>"Oh, nobody to speak of," replied the servant carelessly; "a slip of a lad! I wanted to send him away again, but he's such a pretty boy with never a hair on his chin and blue eyes and a girl's face! So I told him to wait after all. He's got an enormous bouquet in his hand, which he never once consented to put down. One would like to catch him one—a brat like that who ought to be at school still!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_288" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谁来啦？” “啊！没有人来，”佐爱若无其事地回答，“是个小男孩……我真想把他撵走，但是他长得很漂亮，嘴上还没毛哩，一双蓝蓝的眼睛，模样儿像女孩，后来我叫他在那里等着……他手里拿着一大束花，一直不肯放下来……如果是别人，我真要打他几下耳光，一个流鼻涕的毛娃娃，也许还在中学念书呢！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_289');"><p>Mme Lerat went to fetch a water bottle to mix herself some brandy and water, the lumps of sugar having rendered her thirsty. Zoe muttered something to the effect that she really didn't mind if she drank something too. Her mouth, she averred, was as bitter as gall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_289" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>勒拉太太去拿来一大瓶水，把水掺在白兰地里；因为方糖把她吃渴了。佐爱喃喃说，不管怎么样，她也要喝一杯。她说她嘴里苦得像有胆汁似的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_290');"><p>"So you put him—?" continued Mme Maloir.
</p></origin><translate id="div_290" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂，你让他呆在……？”马卢瓦太太问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_291');"><p>"Oh yes, I put him in the closet at the end of the room, the little unfurnished one. There's only one of my lady's trunks there and a table. It's there I stow the lubbers."
</p></origin><translate id="div_291" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哼！我叫他待在最里边的那间小屋里，就是没有家具的那一间，那里只有太太的一只箱子和一张桌子，没有教养的人我都让他们待在那里。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_292');"><p>And she was putting plenty of sugar in her grog when the electric bell made her jump. Oh, drat it all! Wouldn't they let her have a drink in peace? If they were to have a peal of bells things promised well. Nevertheless, she ran off to open the door. Returning presently, she saw Mme Maloir questioning her with a glance.
</p></origin><translate id="div_292" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她往掺水的白兰地里拼命加糖，电铃又响了，她吓了一跳。他妈的！难道连安安静静喝杯酒都不成？如果现在就铃声不断，那还得了！不过，她还是跑去开门了。她回来时，看见马卢瓦太太用询问的目光瞅着她，便说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_293');"><p>"It's nothing," she said, "only a bouquet."
</p></origin><translate id="div_293" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有什么，有人送来一束花。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_294');"><p>All three refreshed themselves, nodding to each other in token of salutation. Then while Zoe was at length busy clearing the table, bringing the plates out one by one and putting them in the sink, two other rings followed close upon one another. But they weren't serious, for while keeping the kitchen informed of what was going on she twice repeated her disdainful expression:
</p></origin><translate id="div_294" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>三个女人一起喝起酒来，并互相点头致意。佐爱终于清理桌子了，她把桌上的碟子一个个拿到洗碗槽里，这时又连续响了两次铃声。但是，这些铃声没有什么要紧的。她总是把厨房里的情况告诉太太们，她又重复了两遍她那句不以为然的话： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_295');"><p>"Nothing, only a bouquet."
</p></origin><translate id="div_295" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有什么，有人送来一束花。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_296');"><p>Notwithstanding which, the old ladies laughed between two of their tricks when they heard her describe the looks of the creditors in the anteroom after the flowers had arrived. Madame would find her bouquets on her toilet table. What a pity it was they cost such a lot and that you could only get ten sous for them! Oh dear, yes, plenty of money was wasted!
</p></origin><translate id="div_296" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两位太太在两局牌之间，听着佐爱讲到花送来后，那些坐在候见厅里的债主们的表情时，个个都笑起来。太太回来后，会发现梳妆台上这些花。可惜的是这些花虽然很贵，却变不成一个子儿。总之，那么多的钱算是白白浪费了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_297');"><p>"For my part," said Mme Maloir, "I should be quite content if every day of my life I got what the men in Paris had spent on flowers for the women."
</p></origin><translate id="div_297" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“以我来说，”马卢瓦太太说，“巴黎的男人每天买花送给女人，花了那么多钱，如果这些钱给我，我就开心了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_298');"><p>"Now, you know, you're not hard to please," murmured Mme Lerat. "Why, one would have only just enough to buy thread with. Four queens, my dear."
</p></origin><translate id="div_298" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我觉得你是很容易满足的，”勒拉太太低声说，“只要给你一点钱，你就……亲爱的，我拿到四张王后，六十分。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_299');"><p>It was ten minutes to four. Zoe was astonished, could not understand why her mistress was out so long. Ordinarily when Madame found herself obliged to go out in the afternoons she got it over in double-quick time. But Mme Maloir declared that one didn't always manage things as one wished. Truly, life was beset with obstacles, averred Mme Lerat. The best course was to wait. If her niece was long in coming it was because her occupations detained her; wasn't it so? Besides, they weren't overworked—it was comfortable in the kitchen. And as hearts were out, Mme Lerat threw down diamonds.
</p></origin><translate id="div_299" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>已经四点差十分了。佐爱感到蹊跷，不知道太太为何这么久还不回来。往常太太下午非出去不可时，她总是匆匆办完事情就回来。可是，马卢瓦太太说，一个人干事，不会事事如愿嘛。勒拉太太说，在人生道路上，确实会碰到一些障碍。最好的办法就是等待；她的侄女在外不回来，一定有什么事情使她回不来，是吗？何况我们丝毫没有不自在的感觉。厨房里很舒服。勒拉太太因为没有红桃了，就打了一张方块。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_300');"><p>The bell began again, and when Zoe reappeared she was burning with excitement.
</p></origin><translate id="div_300" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>铃声又响了。佐爱回来时兴奋得脸都发红了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_301');"><p>"My children, it's fat Steiner!" she said in the doorway, lowering her voice as she spoke. "I've put HIM in the little sitting room."
</p></origin><translate id="div_301" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太们，胖子斯泰内来啦！”她一进门就低声说，“我让他呆在小客厅里。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_302');"><p>Thereupon Mme Maloir spoke about the banker to Mme Lerat, who knew no such gentleman. Was he getting ready to give Rose Mignon the go-by? Zoe shook her head; she knew a thing or two. But once more she had to go and open the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_302" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，马卢瓦太太跟勒拉太太谈起银行家来，勒拉太太不认识这些先生。他是不是正在要抛弃罗丝米尼翁？佐爱点点头，这类事情佐爱倒是了解的。不过，她顾不上说话，得马上再去开门。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_303');"><p>"Here's bothers!" she murmured when she came back. "It's the nigger! 'Twasn't any good telling him that my lady's gone out, and so he's settled himself in the bedroom. We only expected him this evening."
</p></origin><translate id="div_303" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“唉！真倒霉！”她回来时嘟囔道，“黑鬼来了，我跟他说了几遍，太太出去了，这话他听也不听，就在卧室里坐下来…… 本来我们约他晚上来的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_304');"><p>At a quarter past four Nana was not in yet. What could she be after? It was silly of her! Two other bouquets were brought round, and Zoe, growing bored looked to see if there were any coffee left. Yes, the ladies would willingly finish off the coffee; it would waken them up. Sitting hunched up on their chairs, they were beginning to fall asleep through dint of constantly taking their cards between their fingers with the accustomed movement. The half-hour sounded. Something must decidedly have happened to Madame. And they began whispering to each other.
</p></origin><translate id="div_304" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>已经到了四点一刻了，娜娜还没回来。她会有什么事呢？她真糊涂。这时又有人送来两束花。佐爱等得不耐烦了，看看是否还剩些咖啡。对了，再等下去，两位太太会自动把咖啡喝完的，咖啡会给她们提精神。由于她们弯腰驼背躺在椅子里，没完没了地掏牌，动作又很单调，几乎要睡着了。已经四点半钟了。太太肯定是出了事了，她们嘁嘁喳喳议论着。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_305');"><p>Suddenly Mme Maloir forgot herself and in a ringing voice announced: "I've the five hundred! Trumps, Major Quint!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_305" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>突然，马卢瓦太太高兴起来，用响亮的声音说道： “我满五百分了！……我掏了王牌大顺子！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_306');"><p>"Oh, do be quiet!" said Zoe angrily. "What will all those gentlemen think?" And in the silence which ensued and amid the whispered muttering of the two old women at strife over their game, the sound of rapid footsteps ascended from the back stairs. It was Nana at last. Before she had opened the door her breathlessness became audible. She bounced abruptly in, looking very red in the face. Her skirt, the string of which must have been broken, was trailing over the stairs, and her flounces had just been dipped in a puddle of something unpleasant which had oozed out on the landing of the first floor, where the servant girl was a regular slut.
</p></origin><translate id="div_306" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别作声！”佐爱气乎乎地说，“让那几位先生听见了，还成什么体统？” 这时，厨房里静了下来，两个老太太放低嗓门争论着，与此同时，便梯上响起一阵急促的脚步声。娜娜终于回来了。她还没有推开门，就听到她气喘吁吁的声音。她进来时，脸色通红，样子像发生了什么意外事。裙子的束腰一定是扯断了，裙子底边拖在楼梯的梯级上；裙子的边饰浸在一潭污水里，那是从二楼上流下来的，二楼的女佣真是一个邋遢鬼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_307');"><p>"Here you are! It's lucky!" said Mme Lerat, pursing up her lips, for she was still vexed at Mme Maloir's "five hundred." "You may flatter yourself at the way you keep folks waiting."
</p></origin><translate id="div_307" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你终于回来啦！总还算不错！”勒拉太太说道，她撅着嘴，马卢瓦太太得了五百分，她还在生气哩，“让人家等在这里，你可高兴喽！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_308');"><p>"Madame isn't reasonable; indeed, she isn't!" added Zoe.
</p></origin><translate id="div_308" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太确实有点不懂事！”佐爱补了一句。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_309');"><p>Nana was already harassed, and these reproaches exasperated her. Was that the way people received her after the worry she had gone through?
</p></origin><translate id="div_309" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜本来已经不高兴了，又受了这样的指责，便恼火了。 她已经受了一肚子窝囊气，难道大伙就这样来欢迎她吗！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_310');"><p>"Will you blooming well leave me alone, eh?" she cried.
</p></origin><translate id="div_310" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“住嘴！哎，让我安静一下！”她嚷道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_311');"><p>"Hush, ma'am, there are people in there," said the maid.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_312');"><p>Then in lower tones the young Woman stuttered breathlessly:
</p></origin><translate id="div_312" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，娜娜放低了声音，她气喘吁吁，结结巴巴说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_313');"><p>"D'you suppose I've been having a good time? Why, there was no end to it. I should have liked to see you there! I was boiling with rage! I felt inclined to smack somebody. And never a cab to come home in! Luckily it's only a step from here, but never mind that; I did just run home."
</p></origin><translate id="div_313" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们以为我在外边玩吗？这事还没有了结呢。你们要是在场就好了……我可气坏了，我真想给他几个耳光……回来时连一辆马车都没有。幸亏离这儿不远。这也难不倒我，我一口气跑回来了。

</p></origin><translate id="div_315" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎！这个问题！”娜娜答道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_316');"><p>She had sat herself down on a chair close up against the stove, for her legs had failed her after so much running, and without stopping to take breath she drew from behind her stays an envelope in which there were four hundred-franc notes. They were visible through a large rent she had torn with savage fingers in order to be sure of the contents. The three women round about her stared fixedly at the envelope, a big, crumpled, dirty receptacle, as it lay clasped in her small gloved hands.
</p></origin><translate id="div_316" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她在靠近炉子的一张椅子上坐下来，两条腿像跑断了似的；她还没等喘过气来，便从胸衣里掏出一只信封来，里面装着四张一百法郎的钞票。透过信封上一道宽宽的裂口，可以看见那几张票子，裂口是她用手指猛然一下撕开的，目的是想看看里边装的是什么东西。三个女人围着她，目光盯住那只信封，厚厚的信封被她戴手套的小手弄得又皱又脏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_317');"><p>It was too late now—Mme Lerat would not go to Rambouillet till tomorrow, and Nana entered into long explanations.
</p></origin><translate id="div_317" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>时间很晚了，勒拉太太只能明天去朗布依埃了。娜娜开始详细讲起发生的事情。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_318');"><p>"There's company waiting for you," the lady's maid repeated.
</p></origin><translate id="div_318" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太，有客人在等您。”贴身女仆又说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_319');"><p>But Nana grew excited again. The company might wait: she'd go to them all in good time when she'd finished. And as her aunt began putting her hand out for the money:
</p></origin><translate id="div_319" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜又发火了。客人可以等一等。等一会儿，她把事情一办完，就去接待客人。姑妈伸手去拿钱时，娜娜说道：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_320');"><p>"Ah no! Not all of it," she said. "Three hundred francs for the nurse, fifty for your journey and expenses, that's three hundred and fifty. Fifty francs I keep."
</p></origin><translate id="div_320" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！不行，不能全给你，三百法郎给奶妈，五十法郎给你做路费和零用，这就是三百五十法郎……我还得留五十法郎。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_321');"><p>The big difficulty was how to find change. There were not ten francs in the house. But they did not even address themselves to Mme Maloir who, never having more than a six-sou omnibus fair upon her, was listening in quite a disinterested manner. At length Zoe went out of the room, remarking that she would go and look in her box, and she brought back a hundred francs in hundred-sou pieces. They were counted out on a corner of the table, and Mme Lerat took her departure at once after having promised to bring Louiset back with her the following day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_321" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>最大的困难是找来零钱。家里连十个法郎也没有。马卢瓦太太用漠不关心的神态听着，她身上一向只带够乘公共马车的六个苏，她们问也不问她。末了，佐爱走出去，说她去看看箱子里有没有零钱，她总共拿来一百法郎，面值都是一百个苏的。她们在桌子的一端把钱点了一下。勒拉太太答应第二天把小路易带回来，说完就走了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_322');"><p>"You say there's company there?" continued Nana, still sitting on the chair and resting herself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_322" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说有客人吗？”娜娜又说，她一直坐着休息。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_324');"><p>And Zoe mentioned the banker first. Nana made a face. Did that man Steiner think she was going to let herself be bored because he had thrown her a bouquet yesterday evening?
</p></origin><translate id="div_324" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佐爱头一个说到银行家。娜娜撅了撅嘴。 这个斯泰内，是否以为他昨天晚上扔给她一束花，她就让他来烦她吗？ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_325');"><p>"Besides, I've had enough of it," she declared. "I shan't receive today. Go and say you don't expect me now."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_326');"><p>"Madame will think the matter over; Madame will receive Monsieur Steiner," murmured Zoe gravely, without budging from her place. She was annoyed to see her mistress on the verge of committing another foolish mistake.
</p></origin><translate id="div_326" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“请太太考虑一下，太太还是接待斯泰内先生吧。”佐爱没有走，用严肃的神态说道，她见女主人就要做出一件蠢事，很生气。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_327');"><p>Then she mentioned the Walachian, who ought by now to find time hanging heavy on his hands in the bedroom. Whereupon Nana grew furious and more obstinate than ever. No, she would see nobody, nobody! Who'd sent her such a blooming leech of a man?
</p></origin><translate id="div_327" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>随后，她讲到那个瓦拉几亚人，他待在卧室里，肯定觉得时间长了。娜娜一听，火冒三丈，更加坚持自己的意见了，她不愿见任何人！谁给她送来这样一个纠缠不休的男人来！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_328');"><p>"Chuck 'em all out! I—I'm going to play a game of bezique with Madame Maloir. I prefer doing that."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_329');"><p>The bell interrupted her remarks. That was the last straw. Another of the beggars yet! She forbade Zoe to go and open the door, but the latter had left the kitchen without listening to her, and when she reappeared she brought back a couple of cards and said authoritatively:
</p></origin><translate id="div_329" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>电铃声打断了她的话。糟透了，又来了一个讨厌鬼！她不许佐爱去开门。佐爱不听她的话，走出厨房，她回来的时候，交给娜娜两张名片，用权威的神情说道：

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_331');"><p>Nana had sprung up, raging, but the names of the Marquis de Chouard and of Count Muffat de Beuville, which were inscribed on the cards, calmed her down. For a moment or two she remained silent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_331" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜怒不可遏地站起来。可是她看见名片上的名字是德舒阿尔侯爵和缪法德伯维尔伯爵，又平静下来了，她沉默了一会儿。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_332');"><p>"Who are they?" she asked at last. "You know them?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_332" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这两个人是谁？”娜娜终于问道，“你认识他们吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_333');"><p>"I know the old fellow," replied Zoe, discreetly pursing up her lips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_333" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我认识那个老的。”佐爱很谨慎，说完就抿着嘴。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_334');"><p>And her mistress continuing to question her with her eyes, she added simply:
</p></origin><translate id="div_334" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>见女主人继续用疑问的目光瞧着她，她又说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_335');"><p>"I've seen him somewhere."
</p></origin><translate id="div_335" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我在什么地方见过他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_336');"><p>This remark seemed to decide the young woman. Regretfully she left the kitchen, that asylum of steaming warmth, where you could talk and take your ease amid the pleasant fumes of the coffeepot which was being kept warm over a handful of glowing embers. She left Mme Maloir behind her. That lady was now busy reading her fortune by the cards; she had never yet taken her hat off, but now in order to be more at her ease she undid the strings and threw them back over her shoulders.
</p></origin><translate id="div_336" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这句话似乎使娜娜下了决心。她不无遗憾地离开了厨房，离开了这个温暖的藏身处，在那里，她们可以聊天，可以沉湎于正在残余的炭火上热着的咖啡的气味之中。她扔下马卢瓦太太走了，马卢瓦太太现在用纸牌占卜；她头上的帽子一直没有脱下来，只是为了舒服一些，她刚才解开帽带，把帽带扔到肩上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_337');"><p>In the dressing room, where Zoe rapidly helped her on with a tea gown, Nana revenged herself for the way in which they were all boring her by muttering quiet curses upon the male sex. These big words caused the lady's maid not a little distress, for she saw with pain that her mistress was not rising superior to her origin as quickly as she could have desired. She even made bold to beg Madame to calm herself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_337" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在梳妆室里，佐爱很快帮助娜娜穿上晨衣，娜娜低声骂了一些粗话，报复那伙男人，因为他们给她带来很多烦恼。这些话贴身女仆听了心里难过，因为她还不安地看到，太太还没有很快一改当初的放荡生活。她便大胆地请求太太冷静一些。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_338');"><p>"You bet," was Nana's crude answer; "they're swine; they glory in that sort of thing."
</p></origin><translate id="div_338" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！呸！”娜娜语气生硬地回答道，“他们是些下流货，他们才爱听粗话哩。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_339');"><p>Nevertheless, she assumed her princesslike manner, as she was wont to call it. But just when she was turning to go into the drawing room Zoe held her back and herself introduced the Marquis de Chouard and the Count Muffat into the dressing room. It was much better so.
</p></origin><translate id="div_339" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时候，她俨然是一位公主，她经常这样自诩自己的神态。她正向客厅走去时，佐爱拦住她，她自愿去把舒阿尔侯爵和缪法伯爵带到梳妆室来，她说这样做比较好。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_341');"><p>The two men bowed and seated themselves. A blind of embroidered tulle kept the little room in twilight. It was the most elegant chamber in the flat, for it was hung with some light-colored fabric and contained a cheval glass framed in inlaid wood, a lounge chair and some others with arms and blue satin upholsteries. On the toilet table the bouquets—roses, lilacs and hyacinths—appeared like a very ruin of flowers. Their perfume was strong and penetrating, while through the dampish air of the place, which was full of the spoiled exhalations of the washstand, came occasional whiffs of a more pungent scent, the scent of some grains or dry patchouli ground to fine powder at the bottom of a cup. And as she gathered herself together and drew up her dressing jacket, which had been ill fastened, Nana had all the appearance of having been surprised at her toilet: her skin was still damp; she smiled and looked quite startled amid her frills and laces.

</p></origin><translate id="div_342" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太，”缪法伯爵一本正经地说道，“我们执意要见到您，请您原谅，我们是为募捐而来的……这位先生和我，我们都是本区赈济所的成员。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_344');"><p>"When we learned that a great artiste lived in this house we promised ourselves that we would put the claims of our poor people before her in a very special manner. Talent is never without a heart."
</p></origin><translate id="div_344" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们知道这座房子里住着一位大艺术家后，就决定用一种特殊的方式请她关心我们的穷人……天才人物总是有慈悲心的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_345');"><p>Nana pretended to be modest. She answered them with little assenting movements of her head, making rapid reflections at the same time. It must be the old man that had brought the other one: he had such wicked eyes. And yet the other was not to be trusted either: the veins near his temples were so queerly puffed up. He might quite well have come by himself. Ah, now that she thought of it, it was this way: the porter had given them her name, and they had egged one another on, each with his own ends in view.
</p></origin><translate id="div_345" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜装出谦虚的样子。一边微微点头作答，一边在迅速思考他们的问题。她想一定是那个老家伙把另一个人带来的；老头子的眼神很好色。不过，另一个人也值得怀疑，他的太阳穴高得离奇；他也可能是一个人来的。对了，他们一定是从门房那儿知道她的名字的，于是，他们就互相怂恿着来了，他们来找她，各人有各人的目的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_346');"><p>"Most certainly, gentlemen, you were quite right to come up," she said with a very good grace.
</p></origin><translate id="div_346" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然罗，二位是无事不来的。”她和颜悦色地说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_347');"><p>But the electric bell made her tremble again. Another call, and that Zoe always opening the door! She went on:
</p></origin><translate id="div_347" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时电铃又响了，她打了一个哆嗦。又来了一个人，佐爱光开门就忙个不停！她继续说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_348');"><p>"One is only too happy to be able to give."
</p></origin><translate id="div_348" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我是很乐意帮助别人的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_349');"><p>At bottom she was flattered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_349" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>实际上，她是受人恭维了，才说这句话的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_350');"><p>"Ah, madame," rejoined the marquis, "if only you knew about it! there's such misery! Our district has more than three thousand poor people in it, and yet it's one of the richest. You cannot picture to yourself anything like the present distress—children with no bread, women ill, utterly without assistance, perishing of the cold!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_350" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！太太，”侯爵又说，“您知道，他们是怎样穷！我们区里的穷人多达三千多，居然还算是最富裕的区之一哩！您想象不到他们穷到何种地步：孩子们没饭吃，妇女们疾病缠身，又无人救助，眼看就要冻死喽……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_351');"><p>"The poor souls!" cried Nana, very much moved.
</p></origin><translate id="div_351" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们真可怜！”娜娜怀着一片同情心，大声说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_352');"><p>Such was her feeling of compassion that tears flooded her fine eyes. No longer studying deportment, she leaned forward with a quick movement, and under her open dressing jacket her neck became visible, while the bent position of her knees served to outline the rounded contour of the thigh under the thin fabric of her skirt. A little flush of blood appeared in the marquis's cadaverous cheeks. Count Muffat, who was on the point of speaking, lowered his eyes. The air of that little room was too hot: it had the close, heavy warmth of a greenhouse. The roses were withering, and intoxicating odors floated up from the patchouli in the cup.
</p></origin><translate id="div_352" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她那样怜悯他们，美丽的眼睛里不禁噙满了泪水。这时，她也无心故作彬彬有礼的样子了，一下子弯下身子；晨衣张开了，露出了脖子；双膝一伸直，圆圆的屁股在一层薄薄的料子下显露出来。侯爵的灰色面颊上露出微微红晕。缪法伯爵刚要开口，见此情景，耷拉下眼皮。房间里热得像暖房，闷热又不通风。玫瑰花凋谢了，高脚杯底升起一股广藿香味，令人陶醉。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_353');"><p>"One would like to be very rich on occasions like this," added Nana. "Well, well, we each do what we can. Believe me, gentlemen, if I had known—"
</p></origin><translate id="div_353" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“碰到这种情况，我巴不得自己很有钱，”娜娜补充说，“总之，每个人应当尽力而为……请二位相信我，如果我早知道的话……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_354');"><p>She was on the point of being guilty of a silly speech, so melted was she at heart. But she did not end her sentence and for a moment was worried at not being able to remember where she had put her fifty francs on changing her dress. But she recollected at last: they must be on the corner of her toilet table under an inverted pomatum pot. As she was in the act of rising the bell sounded for quite a long time. Capital! Another of them still! It would never end. The count and the marquis had both risen, too, and the ears of the latter seemed to be pricked up and, as it were, pointing toward the door; doubtless he knew that kind of ring. Muffat looked at him; then they averted their gaze mutually. They felt awkward and once more assumed their frigid bearing, the one looking square-set and solid with his thick head of hair, the other drawing back his lean shoulders, over which fell his fringe of thin white locks.
</p></origin><translate id="div_354" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她感动得差一点脱口说出蠢话来。因为经济拮据，她才没把话说完。她尴尬了一阵子，她想不起来在脱连衣裙时，把那五十法郎放到哪里去了。接着，她突然想起来了：那钱大概放在梳妆台的一个角落上，压在一只倒放着的发蜡瓶子底下。她刚站起身来，门铃又响了好一阵子。好呀！又来一个！这可没有个完了。伯爵和侯爵也跟着站起来，侯爵向大门口竖起耳朵，他们大概熟悉这种按门铃的声音。缪法瞅瞅他；接着，他们都避开了对方的目光。他们感到局促不安，但马上又镇静下来。他们当中，一个虎背熊腰，体格健壮，一头浓密的头发；另一个挺着瘦削的肩膀，头顶光秃秃的，一圈稀疏的白发挂在肩上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_355');"><p>"My faith," said Nana, bringing the ten big silver pieces and quite determined to laugh about it, "I am going to entrust you with this, gentlemen. It is for the poor."
</p></origin><translate id="div_355" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“确实不好意思，”娜娜说，她拿来十枚大银币，心里真想笑，“劳驾二位了……这是我送给那些穷人的……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_356');"><p>And the adorable little dimple in her chin became apparent. She assumed her favorite pose, her amiable baby expression, as she held the pile of five-franc pieces on her open palm and offered it to the men, as though she were saying to them, "Now then, who wants some?" The count was the sharper of the two. He took fifty francs but left one piece behind and, in order to gain possession of it, had to pick it off the young woman's very skin, a moist, supple skin, the touch of which sent a thrill through him. She was thoroughly merry and did not cease laughing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_356" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的面颊上露出了可爱的小酒窝，她的样子显得很天真，毫不做作，一只手掌上放着一摞埃居①，伸手把钱递给两个男人，仿佛在说：“喂，谁拿这些钱？”伯爵动作较敏捷，他伸手拿了那五十法郎；不过还剩下一块，他又伸手去拿，手不得不触到少妇手掌的皮肤上，那皮肤又温暖又柔软，他不禁打了一个哆嗦。娜娜快乐极了，笑个不停。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_357');"><p>"Come, gentlemen," she continued. "Another time I hope to give more."
</p></origin><translate id="div_357" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就这么一点钱，两位先生，”她又说，“下次，我希望多给一点。”  
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_358');"><p>The gentlemen no longer had any pretext for staying, and they bowed and went toward the door. But just as they were about to go out the bell rang anew. The marquis could not conceal a faint smile, while a frown made the count look more grave than before. Nana detained them some seconds so as to give Zoe time to find yet another corner for the newcomers. She did not relish meetings at her house. Only this time the whole place must be packed! She was therefore much relieved when she saw the drawing room empty and asked herself whether Zoe had really stuffed them into the cupboards.
</p></origin><translate id="div_358" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>现在他们没有理由不走了，他们施了礼，向着门口走去。然而，他们正要出门时，门铃又响了。侯爵不禁淡淡一笑，伯爵脸上露出了阴郁神色，变得更加严肃了。娜娜让他们稍留一会儿，以便让佐爱再找一个地方把新来的人安顿下来。她不喜欢客人在她家里相互碰面。不过这一次，家里大概坐满了吧。当她看到客厅里还空着时，才松了口气，难道佐爱把客人都藏到衣柜里了吗？ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_359');"><p>"Au revoir, gentlemen," she said, pausing on the threshold of the drawing room.
</p></origin><translate id="div_359" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“再见，先生们。”她站在客厅门口说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_360');"><p>It was as though she lapped them in her laughing smile and clear, unclouded glance. The Count Muffat bowed slightly. Despite his great social experience he felt that he had lost his equilibrium. He needed air; he was overcome with the dizzy feeling engendered in that dressing room with a scent of flowers, with a feminine essence which choked him. And behind his back, the Marquis de Chouard, who was sure that he could not be seen, made so bold as to wink at Nana, his whole face suddenly altering its expression as he did so, and his tongue nigh lolling from his mouth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_360" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她在他们的面前笑个不停，并目光炯炯地打量着他们。缪法伯爵鞠个躬，他虽然阅历丰富，还是不免有些慌张，他需要呼吸新鲜空气，梳妆室使他头晕目眩，花香和女人身上的香味使他窒息。他向梳妆室外走去，舒阿尔侯爵跟在他后边，他想伯爵不会看见自己，便壮着胆子向娜娜眨眨眼，伸伸舌头，做了一个鬼脸。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_361');"><p>When the young woman re-entered the little room, where Zoe was awaiting her with letters and visiting cards, she cried out, laughing more heartily than ever:
</p></origin><translate id="div_361" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜回到梳妆室时，佐爱拿着信件和名片在等她。她一边哈哈大笑，一边嚷道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_362');"><p>"There are a pair of beggars for you! Why, they've got away with my fifty francs!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_362" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这两个穷鬼竟然抢走了我五十法郎！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_363');"><p>She wasn't vexed. It struck her as a joke that MEN should have got money out of her. All the same, they were swine, for she hadn't a sou left. But at sight of the cards and the letters her bad temper returned. As to the letters, why, she said "pass" to them. They were from fellows who, after applauding her last night, were now making their declarations. And as to the callers, they might go about their business!
</p></origin><translate id="div_363" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她一点也没有生气，不过，她觉得男人们从她手中拿钱，是件滑稽的事。总之，他们是猪猡，她现在连一个子儿也没有了。不过，她看见那些信件和名片时，她又恼火了。写信嘛，还说得过去，都是昨天晚上给她鼓掌捧场的先生们写来的，今天他们向他求爱了。至于那些拿着名片来访的人可以滚蛋喽！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_364');"><p>Zoe had stowed them all over the place, and she called attention to the great capabilities of the flat, every room in which opened on the corridor. That wasn't the case at Mme Blanche's, where people had all to go through the drawing room. Oh yes, Mme Blanche had had plenty of bothers over it!
</p></origin><translate id="div_364" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佐爱把访客到处塞；她向大家说，这套房子很适用，每个房间的门都通走廊。这与布朗瑟太太家不一样，进出房间必须经过客厅，所以给布朗瑟太太带来很多不便。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_365');"><p>"You will send them all away," continued Nana in pursuance of her idea. "Begin with the nigger."
</p></origin><translate id="div_365" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你把客人给我统统撵走，”娜娜按照自己的想法说道，“要先从黑鬼开始。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_366');"><p>"Oh, as to him, madame, I gave him his marching orders a while ago," said Zoe with a grin. "He only wanted to tell Madame that he couldn't come to-night."
</p></origin><translate id="div_366" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“黑鬼嘛，太太，我已把他撵走很长时间了，”佐爱嫣然一笑，说道，“他只想跟太太说一声，他今晚来不成了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_367');"><p>There was vast joy at this announcement, and Nana clapped her hands. He wasn't coming, what good luck! She would be free then! And she emitted sighs of relief, as though she had been let off the most abominable of tortures. Her first thought was for Daguenet. Poor duck, why, she had just written to tell him to wait till Thursday! Quick, quick, Mme Maloir should write a second letter! But Zoe announced that Mme Maloir had slipped away unnoticed, according to her wont. Whereupon Nana, after talking of sending someone to him, began to hesitate. She was very tired. A long night's sleep—oh, it would be so jolly! The thought of such a treat overcame her at last. For once in a way she could allow herself that!
</p></origin><translate id="div_367" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜听后，高兴极了，拍起手来。他不来，真算走运！这样，她就自由了！她深深地舒了几口气，她觉得轻松多了，仿佛被从最残酷的苦刑中解脱出来。她首先想到的是达盖内。这只可怜的小猫咪，她刚才还给他写了一封信，叫他等到星期四哩！快点！叫马卢瓦太太马上再写一封信！但是佐爱说，马卢瓦太太像往常一样，不告而辞了，她走时谁也没有发现。于是，娜娜说派一个人去告诉达盖内，说了这句话后，她又犹豫起来。她疲惫不堪。要能睡上一整夜觉，那该多好呀！轻松舒服一下的想法终于在她的头脑中占了上风。她可以让自己轻松一下啦！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_368');"><p>"I shall go to bed when I come back from the theater," she murmured greedily, "and you won't wake me before noon."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_371');"><p>Zoe did not move. She would never have dreamed of giving her mistress overt advice, only now she made shift to give Madame the benefit of her experience when Madame seemed to be running her hot head against a wall.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_374');"><p>The maid still waited, in order to give her mistress time for reflection. Would not Madame be proud to get such a rich gentleman away from her rival Rose Mignon—a man, moreover, who was known in all the theaters?
</p></origin><translate id="div_374" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>女仆仍然呆着不走，想让太太再考虑一会儿。如果太太能从她的情敌罗丝米尼翁手中把这位如此富有、在每家剧院里都赫赫有名的先生夺过来，难道不感到自豪吗？ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_375');"><p>"Now make haste, my dear," rejoined Nana, who perfectly understood the situation, "and tell him he pesters me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_375" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你快去，亲爱的，”娜娜又说，她完全理解女仆的想法，“去告诉他，我讨厌他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_376');"><p>But suddenly there was a reversion of feeling. Tomorrow she might want him. Whereupon she laughed, winked once or twice and with a naughty little gesture cried out:
</p></origin><translate id="div_376" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可是，她突然又变挂了；明天，她也许会要他的。她像个淘气的孩子，做了一个手势，又是笑，又是眨眼睛，大声嚷道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_377');"><p>"After all's said and done, if I want him the best way even now is to kick him out of doors."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_378');"><p>Zoe seemed much impressed. Struck with a sudden admiration, she gazed at her mistress and then went and chucked Steiner out of doors without further deliberation.
</p></origin><translate id="div_378" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佐爱感到惊讶。她瞧瞧太太，敬佩之感油然而生，接着，她便毫不迟疑地去驱赶斯泰内。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_379');"><p>Meanwhile Nana waited patiently for a second or two in order to give her time to sweep the place out, as she phrased it. No one would ever have expected such a siege! She craned her head into the drawing room and found it empty. The dining room was empty too. But as she continued her visitation in a calmer frame of mind, feeling certain that nobody remained behind, she opened the door of a closet and came suddenly upon a very young man. He was sitting on the top of a trunk, holding a huge bouquet on his knees and looking exceedingly quiet and extremely well behaved.
</p></origin><translate id="div_379" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜耐心地等了几分钟，就像她平常所说的，给女仆一点时间“清扫地板”。她真没想到受到这么多客人的突然袭击。她探头望望客厅，里面已空无一人。餐厅里也是空荡荡的。她继续一个房间一个房间地察看，最后确信客人都走光了，才放下心来。当她打开一个小房间的门时，突然看见一个小家伙。他静静地坐在一只箱子上，样子挺乖的，膝盖上放着一大束花。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_380');"><p>"Goodness gracious me!" she cried. "There's one of 'em in there even now!" The very young man had jumped down at sight of her and was blushing as red as a poppy. He did not know what to do with his bouquet, which he kept shifting from one hand to the other, while his looks betrayed the extreme of emotion. His youth, his embarrassment and the funny figure he cut in his struggles with his flowers melted Nana's heart, and she burst into a pretty peal of laughter. Well, now, the very children were coming, were they? Men were arriving in long clothes. So she gave up all airs and graces, became familiar and maternal, tapped her leg and asked for fun:
</p></origin><translate id="div_380" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎哟！天哪！里面还有一个人呢！” 小青年一看见她，就跳到地上，霎时脸涨得通红。他把花束从一只手里移到另一只手里，不知放在哪里是好，一时激动得透不过气来。见他那样年轻，那样尴尬，又是那副滑稽样子，娜娜的心软了，她乐呵呵地笑起来。这么说，就连孩子也来找她了？难道襁褓中的男人也来找她吗？她一下子变得无拘无束，显出一副亲切、慈母般样子，一边拍着大腿，一边逗趣地说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_381');"><p>"You want me to wipe your nose; do you, baby?"

</p></origin><translate id="div_382" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要的。”小家伙用低沉、恳求的声音说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_383');"><p>This answer made her merrier than ever. He was seventeen years old, he said. His name was Georges Hugon. He was at the Varietes last night and now he had come to see her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_383" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这样的回答使她乐开了怀。他才十七岁，名字叫乔治于贡。昨天晚上，他也在游艺剧院里看戏。现在他来看看她。

</p></origin><translate id="div_386" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那就给我吧，小傻瓜！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_387');"><p>But as she took the bouquet from him he sprang upon her hands and kissed them with all the gluttonous eagerness peculiar to his charming time of life. She had to beat him to make him let go. There was a dreadful little dribbling customer for you! But as she scolded him she flushed rosy-red and began smiling. And with that she sent him about his business, telling him that he might call again. He staggered away; he could not find the doors.
</p></origin><translate id="div_387" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而，就在她伸手去拿花时，他以青春期的一股贪婪劲儿猛扑过来吻她的手。她不得不打他一下，让他松开手。这个淌鼻涕的毛孩子干事可犟呢！她一边骂他，一边脸上泛起了红晕，嘴角上挂着微笑。她把他打发走了，不过允许他再来。他踉踉跄跄地往外走，连门都找不着了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_388');"><p>Nana went back into her dressing room, where Francis made his appearance almost simultaneously in order to dress her hair for the evening. Seated in front of her mirror and bending her head beneath the hairdresser's nimble hands, she stayed silently meditative. Presently, however, Zoe entered, remarking:
</p></origin><translate id="div_388" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜刚刚回到梳妆室，弗朗西斯接着也到了，他是来给她完成最后一道理发工序的。娜娜要到晚上才穿衣打扮。她坐在镜子前，低着头，任凭理发师一双灵巧的手来梳剪，她默不作声，陷入沉思之中，这时佐爱进来了，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_389');"><p>"There's one of them, madame, who refuses to go."
</p></origin><translate id="div_389" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太，有一个人不肯走。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_390');"><p>"Very well, he must be left alone," she answered quietly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_390" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么，就让他留下来吧。”娜娜平心静气地回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_391');"><p>"If that comes to that they still keep arriving."
</p></origin><translate id="div_391" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这样下去，就会不断有人来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_392');"><p>"Bah! Tell 'em to wait. When they begin to feel too hungry they'll be off." Her humor had changed, and she was now delighted to make people wait about for nothing. A happy thought struck her as very amusing; she escaped from beneath Francis' hands and ran and bolted the doors. They might now crowd in there as much as they liked; they would probably refrain from making a hole through the wall. Zoe could come in and out through the little doorway leading to the kitchen. However, the electric bell rang more lustily than ever. Every five minutes a clear, lively little ting-ting recurred as regularly as if it had been produced by some well-adjusted piece of mechanism. And Nana counted these rings to while the time away withal. But suddenly she remembered something.
</p></origin><translate id="div_392" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嘿！就让他们等吧。等到他们肚子饿了，他们就走了。” 她的思想开窍了。让男人们空等，她才高兴呢。最后她想出一个开心的办法：她从弗朗西斯的手下溜出来，跑去亲手把门闩上；现在，让他们在隔壁屋子里挤在一起，他们不至于把墙凿穿吧。佐爱可以从通到厨房里的那道小门进来。这时电铃响得越发厉害了。每隔五分钟，就响一次，铃声急促而又清脆，而且颇有节奏，像一台正常运转的机器。娜娜为了轻松一下，数着电铃响的次数。但是，她忽然想起一件事： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_393');"><p>"I say, where are my burnt almonds?"

But now he drew a paper bag from one of the pockets of his frock coat and presented it to her with the discreet gesture of a man who is offering a lady a present. Nevertheless, whenever his accounts came to be settled, he always put the burnt almonds down on his bill. Nana put the bag between her knees and set to work munching her sweetmeats, turning her head from time to time under the hairdresser's gently compelling touch.

</p></origin><translate id="div_395" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真见鬼！”她沉默一会后，喃喃说道，“来了一大帮人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_396');"><p>Thrice, in quick succession, the bell had sounded. Its summonses became fast and furious. There were modest tintinnabulations which seemed to stutter and tremble like a first avowal; there were bold rings which vibrated under some rough touch and hasty rings which sounded through the house with shivering rapidity. It was a regular peal, as Zoe said, a peal loud enough to upset the neighborhood, seeing that a whole mob of men were jabbing at the ivory button, one after the other. That old joker Bordenave had really been far too lavish with her address. Why, the whole of yesterday's house was coming!
</p></origin><translate id="div_396" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>门铃接连响了三下，铃声越来越急促。这些铃声有些是适度的，像初次求爱者那样，吞吞吐吐，颤颤栗栗；有的是放肆的，铃被手指头猛一按就颤动起来；有的铃声很急促，急速的震荡声划破天空。佐爱说得好，这是真正的排钟齐鸣，它的声音足以传遍全区，许多男人接踵而来，揿那象牙电钮。爱开玩笑的博尔德纳夫，果然把娜娜的地址告诉了太多的人，昨晚全剧院的观众统统要来了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_397');"><p>"By the by, Francis, have you five louis?" said Nana.
</p></origin><translate id="div_397" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“噢！对啦！弗朗西斯，”娜娜说，“你身上有五个路易吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_398');"><p>He drew back, looked carefully at her headdress and then quietly remarked:
</p></origin><translate id="div_398" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他往后退了一下，仔细瞧瞧她的头发，然后不慌不忙地说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_399');"><p>"Five louis, that's according!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_399" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“五个路易，这要看情况。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_400');"><p>"Ah, you know if you want securities . . ." she continued.
</p></origin><translate id="div_400" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！你知道，”她接着说，“如果你要担保的话……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_401');"><p>And without finishing her sentence, she indicated the adjoining rooms with a sweeping gesture. Francis lent the five louis. Zoe, during each momentary respite, kept coming in to get Madame's things ready. Soon she came to dress her while the hairdresser lingered with the intention of giving some finishing touches to the headdress. But the bell kept continually disturbing the lady's maid, who left Madame with her stays half laced and only one shoe on. Despite her long experience, the maid was losing her head. After bringing every nook and corner into requisition and putting men pretty well everywhere, she had been driven to stow them away in threes and fours, which was a course of procedure entirely opposed to her principles. So much the worse for them if they ate each other up! It would afford more room! And Nana, sheltering behind her carefully bolted door, began laughing at them, declaring that she could hear them pant. They ought to be looking lovely in there with their tongues hanging out like a lot of bowwows sitting round on their behinds. Yesterday's success was not yet over, and this pack of men had followed up her scent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_401" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的话还没说完，就把手一扬，指指隔壁的几个房间。弗朗西斯借给她五个路易。在理发间歇当儿，佐爱进来为太太梳妆。她马上就要给太太穿衣服了，而理发师还等在那儿，他还要把她的头发再最后梳理一下。可是，电铃响个不停，干扰了女仆，她给太太系带子，只系了一半，袜子只穿了一只，就跑去开门。她虽然经验丰富，这时也晕头转向了。她把客人安置在各个地方，连最小的角落都利用上了，她刚才不得不把三四个男人安顿在一起，这是违背她的原则的。要是他们互相吃了，活该！这样可以腾出地方！娜娜把门闩得紧紧的，躲在屋子里嘲笑他们，她说她还听见他们的喘息声呢。他们的相貌一定很和善，人人伸着舌头，就像围成一圈、坐在地上的一群狗。这是她咋晚成功的继续，这群猎犬似的男人跟踪她追来了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_402');"><p>"Provided they don't break anything," she murmured.
</p></origin><translate id="div_402" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“只要他们不打碎任何东西就行。”娜娜低声说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_403');"><p>She began to feel some anxiety, for she fancied she felt their hot breath coming through chinks in the door. But Zoe ushered Labordette in, and the young woman gave a little shout of relief. He was anxious to tell her about an account he had settled for her at the justice of peace's court. But she did not attend and said:
</p></origin><translate id="div_403" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们热乎乎的呼吸透过门缝传进来，这时她感到惴惴不安了。佐爱把拉博德特引了进来，少妇如释重负地叫了一声。他想告诉她，他在治安裁判所里，给她结了一笔帐。她并不听他讲话，连声说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_404');"><p>"I'll take you along with me. We'll have dinner together, and afterward you shall escort me to the Varietes. I don't go on before half-past nine."
</p></origin><translate id="div_404" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我带你去……我们一起吃晚饭……再从那儿，你陪我到游艺剧院，到九点半钟我才上台演出哩。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_405');"><p>Good old Labordette, how lucky it was he had come! He was a fellow who never asked for any favors. He was only the friend of the women, whose little bits of business he arranged for them. Thus on his way in he had dismissed the creditors in the anteroom. Indeed, those good folks really didn't want to be paid. On the contrary, if they HAD been pressing for payment it was only for the sake of complimenting Madame and of personally renewing their offers of service after her grand success of yesterday.
</p></origin><translate id="div_405" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这个好心的拉博德特，他来得正是时候！他从不向女人提出任何要求。他只做女人们的朋友，连女人们的一些小事，他也肯帮忙。他刚才经过候见厅时，把那些债主都打发走了。再说，这些老实的债主也不是来讨债的，相反，他们呆着不走，是因为太太昨晚获得了巨大成功，他们来向她表示祝贺的，并亲自来为她提供新的效劳。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_406');"><p>"Let's be off, let's be off," said Nana, who was dressed by now.
</p></origin><translate id="div_406" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们走吧，我们走吧。”娜娜说道，她已穿好了衣服。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_407');"><p>But at that moment Zoe came in again, shouting:
</p></origin><translate id="div_407" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>正在这时候，佐爱进来了，嚷道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_408');"><p>"I refuse to open the door any more. They're waiting in a crowd all down the stairs."
</p></origin><translate id="div_408" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太，我不去开门了……楼梯上排成了长队。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_409');"><p>A crowd all down the stairs! Francis himself, despite the English stolidity of manner which he was wont to affect, began laughing as he put up his combs. Nana, who had already taken Labordette's arm, pushed him into the kitchen and effected her escape. At last she was delivered from the men and felt happily conscious that she might now enjoy his society anywhere without fear of stupid interruptions.
</p></origin><translate id="div_409" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>楼梯上排成了长队！弗朗西斯虽然平时装得像英国人那样冷静，也笑起来了，他在整理他的梳子。娜娜挽起拉博德特的胳膊，推着他走向厨房。她终于逃脱出来了，摆脱了男人们的纠缠，她感到很高兴，因为她知道拉博德特单独与自己在一起，不管在什么地方，也不怕遇到麻烦事了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_410');"><p>"You shall see me back to my door," she said as they went down the kitchen stairs. "I shall feel safe, in that case. Just fancy, I want to sleep a whole night quite by myself—yes, a whole night! It's sort of infatuation, dear boy!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_410" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“回来时你要把我送到家门口，”他俩下便梯时，娜娜说道，“这样，我就安全了……你会想到吧，我真想睡上一整夜觉，我一个人睡一整夜。这是我一时的愿望，亲爱的。”
