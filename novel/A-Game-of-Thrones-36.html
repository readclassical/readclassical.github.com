</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3214');"><p>He found Littlefinger in the brothel’s common room, chatting amiably with a tall, elegant woman who wore a feathered gown over skin as black as ink. By the hearth, Heward and a buxom wench were playing at forfeits. From the look of it, he’d lost his belt, his cloak, his mail shirt, and his right boot so far, while the girl had been forced to unbutton her shift to the waist. Jory Cassel stood beside a rain-streaked window with a wry smile on his face, watching Heward turn over tiles and enjoying the view.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3214" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他在妓院的前厅找到小指头，发现他正与一位身材高挑、举止优雅、全身黑如墨汁、穿着羽饰礼服的女士亲切交谈。火炉边，海华则和一位体态丰满的少女玩着猜瓦片的游戏。到目前为止，他已经输掉了皮带、披风、锁子甲和右脚的靴子，女孩则被迫从胸口一直解开到腰部的衣扣。乔里•凯索站在一扇滴雨如注的窗边，脸上挂着嘲弄的微笑，饶有兴味地看着海华输掉一件又一件衣服。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3215');"><p>Ned paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on his gloves. "It’s time we took our leave. My business here is done."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3215" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德停在楼梯口，戴上手套。“我的事已经办完，我们该走了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3216');"><p>Heward lurched to his feet, hurriedly gathering up his things. "As you will, my lord," Jory said. "I’ll help Wyl bring round the horses." He strode to the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3216" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>海华踉跄着站起来，急忙收拾他的东西。“是的，大人。”乔里道，“我去帮韦尔把马牵过来。”他朝门边走去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3217');"><p>Littlefinger took his time saying his farewells. He kissed the black woman’s hand, whispered some joke that made her laugh aloud, and sauntered over to Ned. "Your business," he said lightly, "or Robert’s? They say the Hand dreams the king’s dreams, speaks with the king’s voice, and rules with the king’s sword. Does that also mean you fuck with the king’s..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3217" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头慢条斯理地跟妓女话别。他吻了那黑女人的手，偷偷跟她说了句什么笑话，逗得她高声大笑，最后才神闲气定地走到奈德旁边。“你是自己办事，”他漫不经心地问，“还是替劳勃办事？听人说首相替国王作梦，用国王的声音说话，拿国王的宝剑治理国家，你该不会也是用国王的老二——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3218');"><p>"Lord Baelish," Ned interrupted, "you presume too much. I am not ungrateful for your help. It might have taken us years to find this brothel without you. That does not mean I intend to endure your mockery. And I am no longer the King’s Hand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3218" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“贝里席大人，”奈德打断他。“请您别太不知好歹。我并非不感激您的帮忙。若是没有您，恐怕我们得花上几年时间才能找到这家妓院。但那不代表我愿意忍受您的嘲弄，更何况我已经不是首相了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3219');"><p>"The direwolf must be a prickly beast," said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of his mouth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3219" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我看冰原狼跟刺猬没什么两样嘛。”小指头夸张地撇撇嘴。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3220');"><p>A warm rain was pelting down from a starless black sky as they walked to the stables. Ned drew up the hood of his cloak. Jory brought out his horse. Young Wyl came right behind him, leading Littlefinger’s mare with one hand while the other fumbled with his belt and the lacings of his trousers. A barefoot whore leaned out of the stable door, giggling at him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3220" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们走进马厩时，屋外无星的黑色夜空正下着一阵温暖的雨。奈德拉起兜帽，乔里牵来他的坐骑，年轻的韦尔紧跟在后，一手领着小指头的母马，另一只手忙着系好皮带拉紧长裤。一个赤脚的妓女从马厩门里探出头来，对他咯咯直笑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3221');"><p>"Will we be going back to the castle now, my lord?" Jory asked. Ned nodded and swung into the saddle. Littlefinger mounted up beside him. Jory and the others followed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3221" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，我们这就回城堡吗？”乔里问。奈德点点头，翻身上马。小指头骑行在他身边，乔里和其他人也跟着照办。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3222');"><p>"Chataya runs a choice establishment," Littlefinger said as they rode. "I’ve half a mind to buy it. Brothels are a much sounder investment than ships, I’ve found. Whores seldom sink, and when they are boarded by pirates, why, the pirates pay good coin like everyone else." Lord Petyr chuckled at his own wit.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3222" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“莎塔雅这家店实在挺不赖，”途中小指头说，“有时候我还真想把它给买下来。我发现买妓院远比投资船队来得稳当，因为妓女不会沉，而海盗跳到她们身上的时候，唉，照样也得付钱哪。”培提尔伯爵笑道，似乎对自己的幽默颇感满意。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3223');"><p>Ned let him prattle on. After a time, he quieted and they rode in silence. The streets of King’s Landing were dark and deserted. The rain had driven everyone under their roofs. It beat down on Ned’s head, warm as blood and relentless as old guilts. Fat drops of water ran down his face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3223" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德让他自说自话，过了一会儿，他也静了下来，他们便沉默地骑马前行。君临的街道阴暗而无人迹，大雨把所有的人都赶进了屋里。这雨不断敲打着奈德的头，温热如血，无情一如萦绕心头的过往罪衍。大颗水珠流下他的脸庞。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3224');"><p>"Robert will never keep to one bed," Lyanna had told him at Winterfell, on the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young Lord of Storm’s End. "I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale." Ned had held the babe in his arms; he could scarcely deny her, nor would he lie to his sister, but he had assured her that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter, that he was a good man and true who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna had only smiled. "Love is sweet, dearest Ned, but it cannot change a man’s nature."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3224" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃永不会安于一室。”许久许久以前，在他们的父亲把她许配给风息堡年轻公爵的那个晚上，莱安娜在临冬城对他这么说。“我听说他在艾林谷跟一个女孩生了孩子。”奈德自己便抱过那婴孩，实在无法否认她的话，况且他又不愿欺骗妹妹，便向她保证不论劳勃在婚约之前干过什么风流事，都无足轻重，因为他是个情感真诚的好人，全心全意地爱着她。然而，莱安娜只是笑笑。“我最亲爱的奈德啊，爱情诚然可贵，却终究无法改变一个人的本性。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3225');"><p>The girl had been so young Ned had not dared to ask her age. No doubt she’d been a virgin; the better brothels could always find a virgin, if the purse was fat enough. She had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose, and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe, he saw that her bosom was freckled as well. "I named her Barra," she said as the child nursed. "She looks so like him, does she not, milord? She has his nose, and his hair?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3225" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>刚才那女孩年纪之轻，奈德甚至不敢问她几岁。她原本毫无疑问是个黄花闺女，在稍微高级一点的妓院里，只要钱包够肥，就一定能找到这样的货色。她长了一头淡红的头发，鼻梁两边各有一点雀斑，当她解开衣服，用奶头哺喂婴儿的时候，他发现她的胸部也有雀斑。“我给她取名芭拉，”孩子一边吸奶，她一边说，“大人，她跟他长得可真像，不是吗？她有他的鼻子，还有他的头发……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3226');"><p>"She does." Eddard Stark had touched the baby’s fine, dark hair. It flowed through his fingers like black silk. Robert’s firstborn had had the same fine hair, he seemed to recall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3226" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“的确很像。”艾德•史塔克已经摸过婴儿柔细的深色头发，发丝有如黑丝滑过他的手指。他隐约记得，劳勃的第一个孩子也有着同样的纤细黑发。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3227');"><p>"Tell him that when you see him, milord, as it?.?.?.?as it please you. Tell him how beautiful she is."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3227" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，您见到他的时候，如果您高兴的话……请您告诉他，告诉他她有多漂亮。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3228');"><p>"I will," Ned had promised her. That was his curse. Robert would swear undying love and forget them before evenfall, but Ned Stark kept his vows. He thought of the promises he’d made Lyanna as she lay dying, and the price he’d paid to keep them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3228" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我会的。”奈德答应她。这是他的命。劳勃可以誓言真爱不渝，然后在天黑以前就忘得一干二净，然而奈德•史塔克信守承诺。他想起莱安娜临终之际他所许下的承诺，以及为了遵守誓言付出的种种代价。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3229');"><p>"And tell him I’ve not been with no one else. I swear it, milord, by the old gods and new. Chataya said I could have half a year, for the baby, and for hoping he’d come back. So you’ll tell him I’m waiting, won’t you? I don’t want no jewels or nothing, just him. He was always good to me, truly."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3229" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“请告诉他我没跟过其他人。大人，我以新神与旧神之名起誓。莎塔雅说我可以将养半年，照顾孩子，同时看他会不会回来。所以请您告诉他我在等他，好不好？我不要金银珠宝，我只要他的人。他对我一直很好，真的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3230');"><p>Good to you, Ned thought hollowly. "I will tell him, child, and I promise you, Barra shall not go wanting."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3230" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>对你很好，奈德的思绪好空虚。“孩子，我会告诉他的。我向你保证，芭拉永不会愁吃愁穿。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3231');"><p>She had smiled then, a smile so tremulous and sweet that it cut the heart out of him. Riding through the rainy night, Ned saw Jon Snow’s face in front of him, so like a younger version of his own. If the gods frowned so on bastards, he thought dully, why did they fill men with such lusts? "Lord Baelish, what do you know of Robert’s bastards?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3231" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>听到这话，她笑了，笑得很害怕，却又很甜，看得他心如刀割。骑马走在雨夜，奈德看见琼恩•雪诺的脸出现在眼前，几乎就是年轻时的自己。倘若众神如此厌恶私生儿，他闷闷地想，那么又为何要让男人充满欲望？“贝里席大人，你对劳勃的私生子女所知多少？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3232');"><p>"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3232" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这个嘛，从最简单的说起，他生得比你多。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3233');"><p>"How many?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3233" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“多多少？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3234');"><p>Littlefinger shrugged. Rivulets of moisture twisted down the back of his cloak. "Does it matter? If you bed enough women, some will give you presents, and His Grace has never been shy on that count. I know he’s acknowledged that boy at Storm’s End, the one he fathered the night Lord Stannis wed. He could hardly do otherwise. The mother was a Florent, niece to the Lady Selyse, one of her bedmaids. Renly says that Robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast, and broke in the wedding bed while Stannis and his bride were still dancing. Lord Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his wife’s House, so when the boy was born, he shipped him off to Renly." He gave Ned a sideways glance. "I’ve also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving wench at Casterly Rock, three years ago when he went west for Lord Tywin’s tourney. Cersei had the babes killed, and sold the mother to a passing slaver. Too much an affront to Lannister pride, that close to home."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3234" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头耸肩，雨珠立刻汇集成小溪从他斗篷背后流下。“有关系吗？反正只要睡过的女人够多，总有人会送你大礼，而国王陛下在这方面可从不吝啬。我知道他公开承认的那个风息堡男孩，那是在史坦尼斯大人结婚当晚搞上的。他没法不认，孩子的母亲是佛罗伦家的人，赛丽丝夫人的堂妹，她本人又是她的侍女之一。蓝礼说劳勃在当晚宴会进行途中把那女孩抱上楼，在史坦尼斯和新娘跳舞的时候就在他们婚床上开了她的苞。史坦尼斯大人似乎认为这是他太太娘家名誉的大污点，所以等男孩一出生，便把他装船送到蓝礼那边去了。”他斜眼看看奈德。“我还听说三年前劳勃去西境参加泰温大人的比武大会时，跟凯岩城一个女侍生了对双胞胎。瑟曦派人把孩子杀了，孩子的娘则卖给路过的奴隶贩子。自家后院出这种事，兰尼斯特家哪受得了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3235');"><p>Ned Stark grimaced. Ugly tales like that were told of every great lord in the realm. He could believe it of Cersei Lannister readily enough?.?.?.?but would the king stand by and let it happen? The Robert he had known would not have, but the Robert he had known had never been so practiced at shutting his eyes to things he did not wish to see. "Why would Jon Arryn take a sudden interest in the king’s baseborn children?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3235" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德•史塔克听了不禁皱眉，王国各大家族都有类似的难听传闻。他相信瑟曦•兰尼斯特干得出这种事……但国王会袖手旁观，任她胡来吗？他过去所认识的那个劳勃不会，可话说回来，他过去所认识的那个劳勃，也不像如今这般善于对自己不想知道的事装聋作哑。“琼恩•艾林为什么突然对国王的庶出子女产生了兴趣？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3236');"><p>The short man gave a sodden shrug. "He was the King’s Hand. Doubtless Robert asked him to see that they were provided for."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3236" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>浑身湿透的矮个子耸耸肩。“他是御前首相，想必劳勃要他代为照顾吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3237');"><p>Ned was soaked through to the bone, and his soul had grown cold. "It had to be more than that, or why kill him?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3237" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德被雨淋湿到骨子里去，他的心整个凉了。“一定不止这样，否则干嘛杀他？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3238');"><p>Littlefinger shook the rain from his hair and laughed. "Now I see. Lord Arryn learned that His Grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives, and for that he had to be silenced. Small wonder. Allow a man like that to live, and next he’s like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3238" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头甩开头发上的雨珠，笑道：“原来如此。想必是因为艾林大人知道国王陛下把一堆妓女和渔姑肚子搞大的底细，不得已只好将他灭口。这也难怪，若让这种人活下去，下次他就要说太阳从东边出来啰。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3239');"><p>There was no answer Ned Stark could give to that but a frown. For the first time in years, he found himself remembering Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels; somehow he thought not.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3239" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德•史塔克想不出如何回答，只有皱眉。这么多年来，他发现自己头一遭回忆起雷加•坦格利安。他很好奇雷加是否也常光顾妓院，不知为什么，他相信没有。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3240');"><p>The rain was falling harder now, stinging the eyes and drumming against the ground. Rivers of black water were running down the hill when Jory called out, "My lord," his voice hoarse with alarm. And in an instant, the street was full of soldiers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3240" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>雨势转大，刺痛他的双眼，轰然敲打地面。黑色的浊流从丘陵往下倾泻，这时乔里喊道：“老爷！”他嘶哑的声音里带着警觉。转眼间，街道上满满的都是兵士。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3241');"><p>Ned glimpsed ringmail over leather, gauntlets and greaves, steel helms with golden lions on the crests. Their cloaks clung to their backs, sodden with rain. He had no time to count, but there were ten at least, a line of them, on foot, blocking the street, with longswords and iron-tipped spears. "Behind!" he heard Wyl cry, and when he turned his horse, there were more in back of them, cutting off their retreat. Jory’s sword came singing from its scabbard. "Make way or die!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3241" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德瞥见他们皮衣外罩着环甲、铁手套和护膝，戴着金狮修饰的钢盔，被雨浸湿的披风紧紧贴在背上。他无暇细数，但起码有十个，排成一列，徒步挡住去路，手持长剑和铁枪。“后面！”他听见韦尔大喊，他调转马头，发现后面有更多人，切断了他们的退路。乔里的剑铮地一声出鞘。 “挡路者死！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3242');"><p>"The wolves are howling," their leader said. Ned could see rain running down his face. "Such a small pack, though."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3242" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“狼在叫了。”对方的领队说。奈德可以看见雨水流下他的脸庞。“可惜是小小一群。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3243');"><p>Littlefinger walked his horse forward, step by careful step. "What is the meaning of this? This is the Hand of the King."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3243" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头小心翼翼地策马向前。“你这是什么意思？这可是国王的首相。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3244');"><p>"He was the Hand of the King." The mud muffled the hooves of the blood bay stallion. The line parted before him. On a golden breastplate, the lion of Lannister roared its defiance. "Now, if truth be told, I’m not sure what he is."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3244" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“国王的前任首相。”泥泞模糊了枣红骏马的蹄声，面前的士兵分成两列，金盔金甲的兰尼斯特雄狮桀骜不驯地吼道。“至于现在嘛，说实话，我不知道他算老几。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3245');"><p>"Lannister, this is madness," Littlefinger said. "Let us pass. We are expected back at the castle. What do you think you’re doing?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3245" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“兰尼斯特，你疯了不成？”小指头道，“快让我们过去，我们该回城了。你到底想干什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3246');"><p>"He knows what he’s doing," Ned said calmly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3246" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他很清楚自己在干什么。”奈德平静地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3247');"><p>Jaime Lannister smiled. "Quite true. I’m looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don’t you, Lord Stark? He was with us at Winterfell. Fair-haired, mismatched eyes, sharp of tongue. A short man."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3247" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>詹姆•兰尼斯特微笑道：“此话不假。我在找我老弟。史塔克大人，您还记得我弟弟吧，是不是？我们到临冬城去的时候，他还跟我们一道呢。金头发，大小眼，舌头利，个子矮。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3248');"><p>"I remember him well," Ned replied.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3248" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我记得非常清楚。”奈德回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3249');"><p>"It would seem he has met some trouble on the road. My lord father is quite vexed. You would not perchance have any notion of who might have wished my brother ill, would you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3249" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他似乎在半路上碰到点麻烦。家父为此甚感焦虑。您该不会又正巧知道谁想对我弟弟不利吧，是不是？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3250');"><p>"Your brother has been taken at my command, to answer for his crimes," Ned Stark said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3250" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“令弟乃是在我的命令下遭到逮捕，以为其罪行负责。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3251');"><p>Littlefinger groaned in dismay. "My lords..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3251" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头沮丧地呻吟道：“两位大人——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3252');"><p>Ser Jaime ripped his longsword from its sheath and urged his stallion forward. "Show me your steel, Lord Eddard. I’ll butcher you like Aerys if I must, but I’d sooner you died with a blade in your hand." He gave Littlefinger a cool, contemptuous glance. "Lord Baelish, I’d leave here in some haste if I did not care to get bloodstains on my costly clothing."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3252" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>詹姆爵士自鞘里拔出长剑，踢马向前。“拔剑罢，艾德大人。虽然我恨不得像杀伊里斯那样宰了你，但我宁愿你死的时候手里拿着武器。”他冰冷而轻蔑地看了小指头一眼。“贝里席大人，若你不想身上的漂亮衣服沾上血迹，我建议你尽快离开。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3253');"><p>Littlefinger did not need to be urged. "I will bring the City Watch," he promised Ned. The Lannister line parted to let him through, and closed behind him. Littlefinger put his heels to his mare and vanished around a corner.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3253" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头无需催促。“我这就去找都城守卫队。”他向奈德保证。兰尼斯特家的士兵向外站开，之后又复成包围阵形。小指头一踢马肚，骑着母马消失在街角。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3254');"><p>Ned’s men had drawn their swords, but they were three against twenty. Eyes watched from nearby windows and doors, but no one was about to intervene. His party was mounted, the Lannisters on foot save for Jaime himself. A charge might win them free, but it seemed to Eddard Stark that they had a surer, safer tactic. "Kill me," he warned the Kingslayer, "and Catelyn will most certainly slay Tyrion."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3254" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德的手下也拔出了武器，但他们是三对二十。附近居民在门窗后暗中观望，无人打算干舒。他的部下都骑马，而兰尼斯特家的人除了詹姆都是徒步。冲锋或许能杀出一条血路，但艾德•史塔克认为还有更保险、更安全的策略。“你杀了我，”他警告弑君者。“凯特琳手中的提利昂也性命难保。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3255');"><p>Jaime Lannister poked at Ned’s chest with the gilded sword that had sipped the blood of the last of the Dragonkings. "Would she? The noble Catelyn Tully of Riverrun murder a hostage? I think?.?.?.?not." He sighed. "But I am not willing to chance my brother’s life on a woman’s honor." Jaime slid the golden sword into its sheath. "So I suppose I’ll let you run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened you. I wonder if he’ll care." Jaime pushed his wet hair back with his fingers and wheeled his horse around. When he was beyond the line of swordsmen, he glanced back at his captain. "Tregar, see that no harm comes to Lord Stark."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3255" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>詹姆•兰尼斯特用那把曾啜饮末代龙王鲜血的镀金宝剑戳戳奈德胸膛。“她会吗？奔流城高贵的凯特琳•徒利谋害毫无反抗能力的人臼？我看……她不会。”他叹口气，“但我可不想拿我弟弟的性命来跟一个女人的荣誉感作赌。”詹姆将黄金宝剑回鞘。“这样看来，我只好让你跑去跟劳勃告状，说我是如何欺负你了。我很怀疑他会不会理你？”詹姆伸手把湿发往后一拨，调转马头。当他骑马经过那排武士时，他回头瞄了队长一眼。“崔格，不许伤害史塔克大人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3256');"><p>"As you say, m’lord."

Men closed from both sides. Ned rode one down, cutting at phantoms in red cloaks who gave way before him. Jory Cassel put his heels into his mount and charged. A steel-shod hoof caught a Lannister guardsman in the face with a sickening crunch. A second man reeled away and for an instant Jory was free. Wyl cursed as they pulled him off his dying horse, swords slashing in the rain. Ned galloped to him, bringing his longsword down on Tregar’s helm. The jolt of impact made him grit his teeth. Tregar stumbled to his knees, his lion crest sheared in half, blood running down his face. Heward was hacking at the hands that had seized his bridle when a spear caught him in the belly. Suddenly Jory was back among them, a red rain flying from his sword. "No!" Ned shouted. "Jory, away!" Ned’s horse slipped under him and came crashing down in the mud. There was a moment of blinding pain and the taste of blood in his mouth.

When Ned’s horse lurched back to its feet, he tried to rise, only to fall again, choking on his scream. He could see the splintered bone poking through his calf. It was the last thing he saw for a time. The rain came down and down and down.

His horse moved closer, caught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away. Ned began to drag himself through the mud, gritting his teeth at the agony in his leg. It seemed to take years. Faces watched from candlelit windows, and people began to emerge from alleys and doors, but no one moved to help.

He remembered seeing the Red Keep looming ahead of him in the first grey light of dawn. The rain had darkened the pale pink stone of the massive walls to the color of blood.

He remembered swallowing, and Pycelle was telling someone to heat the wine to boiling and fetch him clean silk, and that was the last he knew.
