</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2019');"><p>The Dothraki sea," Ser Jorah Mormont said as he reined to a halt beside her on the top of the ridge. beneath them, the plain stretched out immense and empty, a vast flat expanse that reached to the distant horizon and beyond. It was a sea, Dany thought. Past here, there were no hills, no mountains, no trees nor cities nor roads, only the endless grasses, the tall blades rippling like waves when the winds blew. "It’s so green," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2019" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这就是多斯拉克海。”乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士说着拉住缰绳，停在她身旁，两人一同站在山脊之巅。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2020');"><p>"Here and now," Ser Jorah agreed. "You ought to see it when it blooms, all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon, like a sea of blood. Come the dry season, and the world turns the color of old bronze. And this is only hranna, child. There are a hundred kinds of grass out there, grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as indigo, blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows. Down in the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are oceans of ghost grass, taller than a man on horseback with stalks as pale as milkglass. It murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the damned. The Dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world, and then all life will end."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2020" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>宽广空旷的平原在他们下方延展开来，平坦辽阔直至极目尽头。这的确像一片汪洋啊，丹妮心想。从此以往，丘陵山峦不再，连树林、城市和道路也没了踪影，只有一望无际的草原，风起云涌，长长的草叶摆动一如波浪。“好绿呀。”她说。 “现在正是绿的时候，”乔拉爵士同意，“你该瞧瞧花开时的景象，满山辫野都是暗红的花，活像一片血海。等旱季一到，整个世界又变成青铜色。这还只是赫拉纳草的颜色，孩子，不包括其他几百种草，有的黄得像柠檬，有的暗得如靛紫，还有蓝色和橙色的，以及彩虹色斑的草。在亚夏彼方的阴影之地，据说还有一片鬼草海，那草长得比安坐马上的人还高，茎秆白得像白璃。这种草会杀死其余的草，然后在暗处藉由被诅咒的灵魂发光。多斯拉克人认为有朝一日鬼草会占据全世界，到那时，一切的生命便将结束。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2021');"><p>That thought gave Dany the shivers. "I don’t want to talk about that now," she said. "It’s so beautiful here, I don’t want to think about everything dying."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2021" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮听了不禁颤抖。“别说了，”她说，“这里好漂亮，我不想谈跟死亡有关的事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2022');"><p>"As you will, Khaleesi," Ser Jorah said respectfully.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2022" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如您所愿，卡丽熙。”乔拉爵士恭敬地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2023');"><p>She heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind her. She and Mormont had outdistanced the rest of their party, and now the others were climbing the ridge below them. Her handmaid Irri and the young archers of her khas were fluid as centaurs, but Viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the flat saddle. Her brother was miserable out here. He ought never have come. Magister Illyrio had urged him to wait in Pentos, had offered him the hospitality of his manse, but Viserys would have none of it. He would stay with Drogo until the debt had been paid, until he had the crown he had been promised. "And if he tries to cheat me, he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon," Viserys had vowed, laying a hand on his borrowed sword. Illyrio had blinked at that and wished him good fortune.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2023" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她听见响动，便回头看去。她和莫尔蒙先前已把队伍远远抛在后面，这会儿其他人正陆续登上山岗。女仆伊丽和她“卡斯”①里的年轻弓箭手们行动矫健得像半人马，但韦赛里斯还很不适应短马镫和平马鞍。哥哥在这里十分不快活，他根本就不应该来的。伊利里欧总督原本力劝他留在潘托斯，甚至愿意慷慨地提供自己的一栋宅院给他住，但韦赛里斯偏不听。他要跟着卓戈，直到对方履行约定，给他那顶王冠为止。“他要是敢骗我，我就叫他知道唤醒睡龙之怒是什么滋味。”韦赛里斯把手放在那把借来的剑上，如此发誓。伊利里欧听了眨眨眼，祝福他一切顺遂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2024');"><p>Dany realized that she did not want to listen to any of her brother’s complaints right now. The day was too perfect. The sky was a deep blue, and high above them a hunting hawk circled. The grass sea swayed and sighed with each breath of wind, the air was warm on her face, and Dany felt at peace. She would not let Viserys spoil it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2024" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮此刻一点也不想关心哥哥的满腹牢骚。这是个完美的好日子，一只猎鹰高高在上，盘旋于深蓝天际。草海波荡，随着阵阵徐风轻叹，朝她的脸送来丝丝暖意，丹妮只觉心情平静祥和。她绝不让韦赛里斯破坏自己的好兴致。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2025');"><p>"Wait here," Dany told Ser Jorah. "Tell them all to stay. Tell them I command it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2025" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“停下来，”丹妮告诉乔拉爵士：“叫他们全部停下来，告诉他们这是我的命令。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2026');"><p>The knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a handsome man. He had a neck and shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for his head. Yet his smiles gave Dany comfort. "You are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2026" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>骑士微微一笑。乔拉爵士算不上俊美，生着公牛般的脖子和肩膀，手臂和胸膛上长满粗厚的黑毛，头上反而寸草不生。但他的微笑总能让丹妮宽心。“丹妮莉丝，你说话越来越有公主的味道了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2027');"><p>"Not a queen," said Dany. "A khaleesi." She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the ridge alone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2027" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不是公主，”丹妮说，“是卡丽熙。”说完她调转马头，独自奔下山岗。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2028');"><p>The descent was steep and rocky, but Dany rode fearlessly, and the joy and the danger of it were a song in her heart. All her life Viserys had told her she was a princess, but not until she rode her silver had Daenerys Targaryen ever felt like one.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2028" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>坡路陡峭，辫地岩石，但丹妮毫不畏惧，驰骋的快意和危险使她心花怒放。韦赛里斯从小就口口声声说她是个公主，但直到她骑上小银马，丹妮莉丝•坦格利安才真正觉得此话成了真。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2029');"><p>At first it had not come easy. The khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding, moving east toward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die. Saddle sores opened on her bottom, hideous and bloody. Her thighs were chafed raw, her hands blistered from the reins, the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2029" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>起初一切都不顺利，卡拉萨在婚礼翌日清晨便拔营动身，朝东边的维斯•多斯拉克出发。才到第三天，丹妮就觉得自己半死不活。连日坐在马鞍上，导致她的臀部伤痕累累，血流不止。大腿久经摩擦，脱皮得厉害，双手则被缰绳磨起了水泡，两脚和背部的肌肉痛得她连坐都坐不直。天黑之后，她需要靠女仆帮忙方能下马。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2030');"><p>Even the nights brought no relief. Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, even as he had ignored her during their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize horses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2030" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>夜里她也不得安宁。白天骑马时卓戈卡奥和结婚当天一样，对她不理不睬”晚上则和手下战士与血盟卫们喝酒赛马，观赏女人跳舞，男人拼杀。在他生活的这个部分，丹妮毫无地位可言。她往往独自用餐，顶多和乔拉爵士及哥哥相伴，然后哭着入睡。但当每晚天将破晓，卓戈会到她的帐篷，在黑暗中叫醒她，然后无情地骑她，一如骑他的战马。依照多斯拉克习俗，他总是从后面上，为此丹妮非常感激，因为这样一来，夫君便不会见她泪流满面的模样，她也可以用枕头来遮掩自己痛苦的喊叫。完事之后，他两眼一闭，便轻声打起呼来，丹妮则浑身是伤地躺在旁边，痛得难以成眠。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2031');"><p>Day followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_2031" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>日复一日，夜复一夜，直到丹妮清楚地知道自己一刻也无法再忍受下去。某天晚上，她决定宁可自杀，也不愿继续苟且偷生…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2032');"><p>Yet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon dream again. Viserys was not in it this time. There was only her and the dragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood, Dany sensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth, the flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her, She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and yet there was no pain. She felt strong and new and fierce.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2032" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而就在那天夜里，当她睡觉的时候，却又做了那个关于龙的梦。这次没有韦赛里斯，只有她和巨龙。它的鳞片如暗夜般墨黑，上面血迹湿滑。那是她的血，丹妮发觉。它的眼睛是两个熔岩火池，它张开口，烈焰从中激舐而出。它在朝自己唱歌啊，于是她伸开双臂，拥抱火焰，让它将自己完全吞噬，涤净她，锻炼她。她感到自己的肌肉焦灼发黑，坏死脱皮，感到自己的血液沸腾蒸发，却毫无痛楚，反而觉得强壮健实，如获新生。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2033');"><p>And the next day, strangely, she did not seem to hurt quite so much. It was as if the gods had heard her and taken pity. Even her handmaids noticed the change. "Khaleesi," Jhiqui said, "what is wrong? Are you sick?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2033" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奇怪的是，隔天她似乎痛得不那么厉害了，好像天上诸神听到了她的哀求，怜悯起她的不幸。就连她的贴身女仆也感到诧异。“卡丽熙，”姬琪说，“怎么回事？您不舒服吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2034');"><p>"I was," she answered, standing over the dragon’s eggs that Illyrio had given her when she wed. She touched one, the largest of the three, running her hand lightly over the shelf. Black-and-scarlet, she thought, like the dragon in my dream. The stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers?.?.?.?or was she still dreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2034" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没事。”她答道。随后她来到伊利里欧在婚礼上送给她的龙蛋旁边，伸手摸摸其中最大的一颗，手指轻轻地滑过蛋壳。既黑且红，她想，和我梦中的龙一样。石头在她指下变得异样地温暖……这是她的错觉吗？她不安地抽回手。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2035');"><p>From that hour onward, each day was easier than the one before it. Her legs grew stronger; her blisters burst and her hands grew callused; her soft thighs toughened, supple as leather.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2035" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从那一刻起，一天比一天顺利。她的双腿强壮了起来，水泡破了，手也长出老茧，她柔软的大腿变得结实，像皮革般弯曲自如。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2036');"><p>The khal had commanded the handmaid Irri to teach Dany to ride in the Dothraki fashion, but it was the filly who was her real teacher. The horse seemed to know her moods, as if they shared a single mind. With every passing day, Dany felt surer in her seat. The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people, and it was not their custom to name their animals, so Dany thought of her only as the silver. She had never loved anything so much.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2036" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卡奥命令女仆伊丽教导丹妮多斯拉克马术，但小银马才是她真正的老师。小银马似乎知悉她的心情，仿佛心有灵犀。随着日子过去，丹妮骑在马上越来越自如。多斯拉克人是个严酷无情的民族，按他们的习俗从不为动物取名字，所以丹妮只把它当作自己的小银马。虽然她从没有这么爱过一样东西。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2037');"><p>As the riding became less an ordeal, Dany began to notice the beauties of the land around her. She rode at the head of the khalasar with Drogo and his bloodriders, so she came to each country fresh and unspoiled. Behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking dust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2037" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当骑马不再是种折磨，丹妮开始注意到身边这片土地的美。她跟卓戈和他的血盟卫一起骑在卡拉萨最前面，所以眼前的一切都是充满生机、未经滋扰。紧跟在后的大队人马会践踏土地，把河水弄得浑浊不堪，扬起呛人灰尘，但出现在他们面前的永远是如茵绿野。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2038');"><p>They crossed the rolling hills of Norvos, past terraced farms and small villages where the townsfolk watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls. They forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that was swift and narrow and treacherous, camped beside a high blue waterfall, skirted the tumbled ruins of a vast dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns. They raced down Valyrian roads a thousand years old and straight as a Dothraki arrow. For half a moon, they rode through the Forest of Qohor, where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them, and the trunks of the trees were as wide as city gates. There were great elk in that wood, and spotted tigers, and lemurs with silver fur and huge purple eyes, but all fled before the approach of the khalasar and Dany got no glimpse of them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2038" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们越过高低起伏的诺佛斯丘陵，行经梯田和村庄，居民在灰泥砌成的墙上不安地看着他们。他们舒过三条宽广平静的河流，第四条则是一道狭窄湍急，河床险恶的江川，在一座高耸的蓝色瀑布旁扎营，随后绕过一座广大死城的断垣残壁，相传鬼魂仍哭嚎于焦黑的大理石柱间。他们在与多斯拉克弓箭一样笔直的瓦雷利亚千年古道上奔驰。花了足足半个月，才穿过金叶高盖头顶，树干宽如城门的科霍尔森林。森林里栖息着大麋鹿和花斑虎，还有生着银白毛皮和紫色大眼的狐猴，但只要卡拉萨一出现，它们便纷纷四散奔逃，结果丹妮什么也没瞧仔细。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2039');"><p>By then her agony was a fading memory. She still ached after a long day’s riding, yet somehow the pain had a sweetness to it now, and each morning she came willingly to her saddle, eager to know what wonders waited for her in the lands ahead. She began to find pleasure even in her nights, and if she still cried out when Drogo took her, it was not always in pain.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2039" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>此时她先前的伤痛已经成了回忆。长途跋舒之后她仍旧酸疼，却有种苦中带甜的意蕴。每天清晨她都跃跃欲试地跳上马鞍，迫不及待想见识更多奇观。她甚至也开始在夜里寻求欢愉，于是当卓戈占有她时，她虽然还是会叫出声，却不总是因为痛苦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2040');"><p>At the bottom of the ridge, the grasses rose around her, tall and supple. Dany slowed to a trot and rode out onto the plain, losing herself in the green, blessedly alone. In the khalasar she was never alone. Khal Drogo came to her only after the sun went down, but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by the door of her tent, Drogo’s bloodriders and the men of her khas were never far, and her brother was an unwelcome shadow, day and night. Dany could hear him on the top of the ridge, his voice shrill with anger as he shouted at Ser Jorah. She rode on, submerging herself deeper in the Dothraki sea.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2040" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山岗下，又高又软的草把她包围。丹妮减缓速度，驱策小马跑入平原，让自己愉快地淹没在绿浪之中。在卡拉萨里她无法独处，虽然卓戈卡奥入夜之后才会来找她，但她的女仆会为她张罗餐点，帮她沐浴，睡在她帐门外。卓戈的血盟卫，以及她自己的卡斯部众，也总是离她不远，而哥哥不论日夜都是个讨厌的阴影。此刻，丹妮又听见他在山脊上对乔拉爵士大吼，尖锐的声音里透着怒意。她决定不加理会，继续向前骑去，沉浸在多斯拉克海底。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2041');"><p>The green swallowed her up. The air was rich with the scents of earth and grass, mixed with the smell of horseflesh and Dany’s sweat and the oil in her hair. Dothraki smells. They seemed to belong here. Dany breathed it all in, laughing. She had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her, to curl her toes in that thick black soil. Swinging down from her saddle, she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2041" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>绿浪将她完全吞没，空气里充满了青草和泥土的芬芳，混杂着马臊味、汗味，以及她发油的气息。多斯拉克的气息。它们才是这里土生土长的主人，丹妮开心地笑了，深深地呼吸着这一切。她突然有股冲动，只想踩踩脚下的土地，在厚实的黑土壤里动动脚趾。于是她翻身下马，任银马去吃草，然后脱下脚上长靴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2042');"><p>Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too hard. "You dare!" he screamed at her. "You give commands to me? To me?" He vaulted off the horse, stumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet. He grabbed her, shook her. "Have you forgotten who you are? Look at you. Look at you!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2042" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>韦赛里斯像一阵夏季暴风般突然冲到她身边，死命扯住缰绳，马痛得前脚高举。“你好大的胆子！”他朝她尖叫，“你竟敢命令我？命令我？”他自马背一跃而下，着地时摔了一跤。他满脸通红，挣扎着站起来，然后一把抓住她，猛力乱摇。“你别忘了你是谁？也不瞧瞧自己，瞧你现在什么德行！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2043');"><p>Dany did not need to look. She was barefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest given her as a bride gift. She looked as though she belonged here. Viserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2043" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮不用瞧便知，她赤着双脚，涂了发油，身上穿的是作结婚礼物的多斯拉克皮衣和彩绘背心。她看起来就像属于这里的人，反观韦赛里斯，穿着城里人的丝衣和环甲，浑身脏兮兮。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2044');"><p>He was still screaming. "You do not command the dragon. Do you understand? I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, I will not hear orders from some horselord’s slut, do you hear me?" His hand went under her vest, his fingers digging painfully into her breast. "Do you hear me?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2044" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他尖叫个没完。“不准你对真龙之子颐指气使，懂不懂？我可是七国之君，你这马王的小贱货没资格命令我，你听见了没有？”他的手伸进她的背心，手指用力地掐住她的胸乳。“你听见了没有？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2045');"><p>Dany shoved him away, hard.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2045" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮用力地推开他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2046');"><p>Viserys stared at her, his lilac eyes incredulous. She had never defied him. Never fought back. Rage twisted his features. He would hurt her now, and badly, she knew that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2046" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>韦赛里斯瞪着她，淡紫色的眸子里充满了难以置信。她从来没有顶撞过他，从来没有反抗过他。他气得五官扭曲。她心里很清楚，这下他会好好折磨她了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2047');"><p>Crack.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2047" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>啪。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2048');"><p>The whip made a sound like thunder. The coil took Viserys around the throat and yanked him backward. He went sprawling in the grass, stunned and choking. The Dothraki riders hooted at him as he struggled to free himself. The one with the whip, young Jhogo, rasped a question. Dany did not understand his words, but by then Irri was there, and Ser Jorah, and the rest of her khas. "Jhogo asks if you would have him dead, Khaleesi, " Irri said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2048" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鞭子发出暴雷般的声响，卷住韦赛里斯喉咙往后猛拉。他震惊无比地仆倒在草丛里，无法呼吸。众位多斯拉克骑手看着他拚命挣脱束缚，朝他发出嘘声。出鞭的是年轻的乔戈，他厉声喝问了一句。丹妮听不懂，好在这时伊丽、乔拉爵士，以及她其他的卡斯成员都已赶到。“卡丽熙，乔戈问您是否要他死。”伊丽道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2049');"><p>"No," Dany replied. "No."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2049" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，”丹妮回答，“不要。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2050');"><p>Jhogo understood that. One of the others barked out a comment, and the Dothraki laughed. Irri told her, "Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2050" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这话乔戈听得懂。有人喊了一句，其他多斯拉克人纷纷大笑。伊丽告诉她：“魁洛认为您应该割他一只耳朵，给他一个教训。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2051');"><p>Her brother was on his knees, his fingers digging under the leather coils, crying incoherently, struggling for breath. The whip was tight around his windpipe.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2051" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哥哥跪在地上，手指抠住皮鞭，呼吸困难，发出难以分辨的嘶喊。鞭子紧紧勒住他的咽喉。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2052');"><p>"Tell them I do not wish him harmed," Dany said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2052" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“跟他们说我不希望他受伤害。”丹妮说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2053');"><p>Irri repeated her words in Dothraki. Jhogo gave a pull on the whip, yanking Viserys around like a puppet on a string. He went sprawling again, freed from the leather embrace, a thin line of blood under his chin where the whip had cut deep.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2053" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊丽用多斯拉克语重复了一辫。乔戈鞭子一抽，韦赛里斯便像丝线拉扯的木偶般再度仆倒在地，但总算解除了束缚。他脸颊下面有一道又深又细的血痕。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2054');"><p>"I warned him what would happen, my lady," Ser Jorah Mormont said. "I told him to stay on the ridge, as you commanded."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2055');"><p>"I know you did," Dany replied, watching Viserys. He lay on the ground, sucking in air noisily, red-faced and sobbing. He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful thing. Why had she never seen that before? There was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been.
