</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5134');"><p>Chella daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears had gone ahead to scout, and it was she who brought back word of the army at the crossroads. "By their fires I call them twenty thousand strong," she said. "Their banners are red, with a golden lion."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5134" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>黑耳部的齐克之女齐拉当先去侦察，带回岔路口有支军队的消息。“从他们的营火计算，应该有两万个，”她说，“红旗子，上面一只金狮子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5135');"><p>"Your father?" Bronn asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5135" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是你父亲?”波隆问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5136');"><p>"Or my brother Jaime," Tyrion said. "We shall know soon enough." He surveyed his ragged band of brigands: near three hundred Stone Crows, Moon Brothers, Black Ears, and Burned Men, and those just the seed of the army he hoped to grow. Gunthor son of Gurn was raising the other clans even now. He wondered what his lord father would make of them in their skins and bits of stolen steel. If truth be told, he did not know what to make of them himself. Was he their commander or their captive? Most of the time, it seemed to be a little of both. "It might be best if I rode down alone," he suggested.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5136" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要不就是我老哥詹姆。”提利昂说，“我们很快就会知道了。”他检视着自己这支衣着破烂的土匪队伍：三百名来自石鸦部、月人部、黑耳部和灼人部的原住民，这只是他着手组建的军队的种子。而冈恩之子冈梭尔此刻正在召集其他部落。他不知父亲看了这些身穿兽皮、手持偷来的破铜烂铁的人会怎么说，事实上，他自己看了都不知道该说什么才好。他究竟是他们的首领还是俘虏?恐怕是两者皆有罢。“我最好自个儿下去。”他提议。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5137');"><p>"Best for Tyrion son of Tywin," said Ulf, who spoke for the Moon Brothers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5137" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对泰温之子提利昂来说最好。”月人部的首领乌尔夫说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5138');"><p>Shagga glowered, a fearsome sight to see. "Shagga son of Dolf likes this not. Shagga will go with the boyman, and if the boyman lies, Shagga will chop off his manhood..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5138" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>夏嘎睁大眼睛瞪着他，露出骇人的神情。“多夫之子夏嘎不喜欢。夏嘎要和小男人一起去』口果小男人说谎，夏嘎就会剁掉他的命根子——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5139');"><p>"...and feed it to the goats, yes," Tyrion said wearily. "Shagga, I give you my word as a Lannister, I will return."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5139" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“——拿去喂山羊，我知道。”提利昂有气无力地说，“夏嘎，我以兰尼斯特家之名起誓，我会回来的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5140');"><p>"Why should we trust your word?" Chella was a small hard woman, flat as a boy, and no fool. "Lowland lords have lied to the clans before."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5140" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们为什么要相信你的话? ”齐拉是个矮小强悍的女人，胸平坦得和男孩子一样，却一点也不笨。“平地人的酋长以前欺骗过山上部落。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5141');"><p>"You wound me, Chella," Tyrion said. "Here I thought we had become such friends. But as you will. You shall ride with me, and Shagga and Conn for the Stone Crows, Ulf for the Moon Brothers, and Timett son of Timett for the Burned Men." The clansmen exchanged wary looks as he named them. "The rest shall wait here until I send for you. Try not to kill and maim each other while I’m gone."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5141" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“齐拉，你这样说真是太伤我的心了，”提利昂道，“我还以为我们已经成了好朋友呢。不过算啦，你就跟我一道去吧，夏嘎、康恩代表石鸦部，乌尔夫代表月人部，提魅之子提魅代表灼人部，你们几个也一起来。”被他点名的原住民满怀戒心地彼此看看。“其余的留在这里等我通知。我不在的时候，拜托千万不要自相残杀。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5142');"><p>He put his heels to his horse and trotted off, giving them no choice but to follow or be left behind. Either was fine with him, so long as they did not sit down to talk for a day and a night. That was the trouble with the clans; they had an absurd notion that every man’s voice should be heard in council, so they argued about everything, endlessly. Even their women were allowed to speak. Small wonder that it had been hundreds of years since they last threatened the Vale with anything beyond an occasional raid. Tyrion meant to change that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5142" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他两腿一夹马肚，向前快跑，逼他们要么立刻跟上，要么被抛在后面。其实他们有没有跟上对他来说都没差，怕只怕他们坐下来“讨论”个三天三夜。这是原住民最麻烦的地方，他们有种古怪的观念，认为开会的时候每个人都有权表达意见，甚至连女人也有开口的权利，所以不论事情大小，他们一律争吵不休。难怪几百年来，除了偶尔实施小规模的突袭，他们无法真正威胁到艾林谷。提利昂有意改变这个局面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5143');"><p>Brorm rode with him. Behind them, after a quick bit of grumbling, the five clansmen followed on their undersize garrons, scrawny things that looked like ponies and scrambled up rock walls like goats.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5143" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>波隆和他并肩而行，身后——咕哝了几声以后——五个原住民骑着营养不良的矮种马跟了上来。每匹马都骨瘦如柴，看起来小得可怜，走在颠簸山路上活像是山羊。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5144');"><p>The Stone Crows rode together, and Chella and Ulf stayed close as well, as the Moon Brothers and Black Ears had strong bonds between them. Timett son of Timett rode alone. Every clan in the Mountains of the Moon feared the Burned Men, who mortified their flesh with fire to prove their courage and (the others said) roasted babies at their feasts. And even the other Burned Men feared Timett, who had put out his own left eye with a white-hot knife when he reached the age of manhood. Tyrion gathered that it was more customary for a boy to burn off a nipple, a finger, or (if he was truly brave, or truly mad) an ear. Timett’s fellow Burned Men were so awed by his choice of an eye that they promptly named him a red hand, which seemed to be some sort of a war chief.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5144" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两个石鸦部的人走在一块，齐拉跟乌尔夫靠得很近，因为月人部和黑耳部之间的关系向来密切。提魅之子提魅则独自前行。明月山脉里的每一个部落都害怕灼人部，因为他们用火自虐来证明勇气，甚至在宴会上烧烤婴儿来吃(这是其他几部说的) 。而提魅更令所有灼人部民害怕，因为他成年的时候用一把烧得白热的尖刀剜出了自己的左眼。提利昂大致听出，灼人部中一般男孩的成年礼多半是烧掉自己的一边乳头、一根手指或是(只有非常勇敢或非常疯狂的人才做得出) 一只耳朵。提魅的灼人部同胞由于对他的挖眼行径大为折服，立刻便让他成为“红手”，约略等于战争领袖的意思。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5145');"><p>"I wonder what their king burned off," Tyrion said to Bronn when he heard the tale. Grinning, the sellsword had tugged at his crotch?.?.?.?but even Bronn kept a respectful tongue around Timett. If a man was mad enough to put out his own eye, he was unlikely to be gentle to his enemies.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5145" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我真想知道他们的国王烧掉的是什么。”提利昂听这故事的时候，对波隆这么说。佣兵嘿嘿一笑，伸手指指他的胯下……不过就连波隆，在提魅身边讲话也特别小心。既然这人疯到连自己眼睛都敢挖出来，想必不会对敌人温柔。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5146');"><p>Distant watchers peered down from towers of unmortared stone as the party descended through the foothills, and once Tyrion saw a raven take wing. Where the high road twisted between two rocky outcrops, they came to the first strong point. A low earthen wall four feet high closed off the road, and a dozen crossbowmen manned the heights. Tyrion halted his followers out of range and rode to the wall alone. "Who commands here?" he shouted up.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5146" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>队伍骑马走下山麓小丘，远处，未砌水泥的石臸嘹望塔上，守卫正向下扫视。一只渡鸦振翅高飞。山路夹在裸岩中间转弯，他们来到了第一个有重兵防守的关卡。道路为一堵四尺陶土矮墙所阻挡，高处站有十来个十字弓兵负责把守。提利昂要同伴们停在舐程之外，策马独自走近。 “这儿由谁负责? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5147');"><p>The captain was quick to appear, and even quicker to give them an escort when he recognized his lord’s son. They trotted past blackened fields and burned holdfasts, down to the riverlands and the Green Fork of the Trident. Tyrion saw no bodies, but the air was full of ravens and carrion crows; there had been fighting here, and recently.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5147" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>守卫队长很快出现，一认出他是领主的儿子，立刻派人马护送他们下山。他们快马跑过焦黑的田野和焚尽的村舍，进入河间地区，接近三叉戟河的支流绿叉河。提利昂虽没看见尸体，但空气中弥漫着专食腐尸的乌鸦发出的味道；显然这里最近曾发生战斗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5148');"><p>Half a league from the crossroads, a barricade of sharpened stakes had been erected, manned by pikemen and archers. Behind the line, the camp spread out to the far distance. Thin fingers of smoke rose from hundreds of cookfires, mailed men sat under trees and honed their blades, and familiar banners fluttered from staffs thrust into the muddy ground.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5148" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>离十字路口半里格的地方，架起了一道削尖木桩排列的防御工事，由长矛兵和弓箭手负责防守。防线之后，营地绵延直至远方，炊烟如纤细的手指，自几百座营火中升起，全副武装的人坐在树下磨利武器，熟悉的旗臶飘扬风中，旗竿深深插进泥泞的地面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5149');"><p>A party of mounted horsemen rode forward to challenge them as they approached the stakes. The knight who led them wore silver armor inlaid with amethysts and a striped purple-and-silver cloak. His shield bore a unicorn sigil, and a spiral horn two feet long jutted up from the brow of his horsehead helm. Tyrion reined up to greet him. "Ser Flement."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5149" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们走近木栅时，一群骑兵上前盘问。领头的骑士身穿镶紫水晶的银铠甲，肩披紫银条纹披风，盾牌上绘有独角兽纹饰，马形头盔前端有一根螺旋独角。捉利昴勒马问候：“佛列蒙爵士。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5150');"><p>Ser Flement Brax lifted his visor. "Tyrion," he said in astonishment. "My lord, we all feared you dead, or?.?.?.?" He looked at the clansmen uncertainly. "These?.?.?.?companions of yours?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5150" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佛列蒙•布拉克斯爵士揭起面罩。“提利昂，”他惊讶地说，“大人，我们都以为您死了，不然也……”他有些犹豫地看着那群原住民。“您的这些……同伴……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5151');"><p>"Bosom friends and loyal retainers," Tyrion said. "Where will I find my lord father?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5151" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们是我亲密的朋友和忠诚的部属，”提利昂道，“我父亲在哪儿?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5152');"><p>"He has taken the inn at the crossroads for his quarters."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5152" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他暂时将岔路口的旅店当成指挥总部。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5153');"><p>Tyrion laughed. The inn at the crossroads! Perhaps the gods were just after all. "I will see him at once."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5153" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂不禁苦笑，路口那家旅店!或许天上诸神当真有其公理在。“我这就去见他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5154');"><p>"As you say, my lord." Ser Flement wheeled his horse about and shouted commands. Three rows of stakes were pulled from the ground to make a hole in the line. Tyrion led his party through.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5154" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“遵命，大人。”佛列蒙爵士调转马头，一声令下，便有人将三排木桩从地上拔起，空出一条路来，让提利昂带着他的人马穿过。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5155');"><p>Lord Tywin’s camp spread over leagues. Chella’s estimate of twenty thousand men could not be far wrong. The common men camped out in the open, but the knights had thrown up tents, and some of the high lords had erected pavilions as large as houses. Tyrion spied the red ox of the Presters, Lord Crakehall’s brindled boar, the burning tree of Marbrand, the badger of Lydden. Knights called out to him as he cantered past, and men-at-arms gaped at the clansmen in open astonishment.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5155" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>泰温公爵的军营广达数里，齐拉估计的两万人与事实相去不远。普通士兵露天扎营，骑士则搭建帐篷，而有些领主的营帐大得像房屋一样。提利昂瞥见普莱斯特家族的红牛纹饰、克雷赫伯爵的斑纹野猪、马尔布兰家族的燃烧之树，以及莱顿家族的獾。他快步跑过，骑士们纷纷向他打招呼，而民兵见了那群原住民，吃惊得张大了嘴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5156');"><p>Shagga was gaping back; beyond a certainty, he had never seen so many men, horses, and weapons in all his days. The rest of the mountain brigands did a better job of guarding their faces, but Tyrion had no doubts that they were full as much in awe. Better and better. The more impressed they were with the power of the Lannisters, the easier they would be to command.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5156" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>夏嘎的嘴张得也不小；显然他这辈子都没见过这么多人、马和武器。其他几名高山盗匪的惊讶之情掩饰得稍微好一点，但提利昂认为他们的惊讶程度绝不在夏嘎之下。情况对他越来越有利了，他们越是对兰尼斯特家的势力感到折服，就越容易听他摆布。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5157');"><p>The inn and its stables were much as he remembered, though little more than tumbled stones and blackened foundations remained where the rest of the village had stood. A gibbet had been erected in the yard, and the body that swung there was covered with ravens. At Tyrion’s approach they took to the air, squawking and flapping their black wings. He dismounted and glanced up at what remained of the corpse. The birds had eaten her lips and eyes and most of her cheeks, baring her stained red teeth in a hideous smile. "A room, a meal, and a flagon of wine, that was all I asked," he reminded her with a sigh of reproach.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5157" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>旅店和马厩与记忆中相去不远，只是村里的其他屋舍如今只剩乱石残垣和焦黑地基。旅店院子里搭起了一座绞刑台，挂在上面的尸体前后摇摆，全身停满了乌鸦。提利昂接近时，乌鸦纷纷“嘎嘎”叫，振翅腾空。他跳下马，抬头看着尸体的残余部分。她的嘴唇、眼睛和大半脸颊都给啃了个干净，腥红的牙齿暴露在外，露出一抹狰狞的笑容。“我不过跟你要一个房间、一顿晚饭和一瓶酒罢了。”他语带指责地叹了口气。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5158');"><p>Boys emerged hesitantly from the stables to see to their horses. Shagga did not want to give his up. "The lad won’t steal your mare," Tyrion assured him. "He only wants to give her some oats and water and brush out her coat." Shagga’s coat could have used a good brushing too, but it would have been less than tactful to mention it. "You have my word, the horse will not be harmed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5158" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>几个小男孩迟疑地从马厩里出来照料他们的马匹，可夏嘎不愿交出自己的坐骑。“这小鬼不会偷你的母马啦，”提利昂向他保证。“他只是想喂它吃点燕麦，喝些水，刷刷背罢了。”老实说，夏嘎自己的毛皮外衣也很需要刷一刷，不过直接说出口未免太没技巧了。“我跟你保证，马儿绝不会受伤。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5159');"><p>Glaring, Shagga let go his grip on the reins. "This is the horse of Shagga son of Dolf," he roared at the stableboy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5159" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>夏嘎瞪大眼睛，松开紧握缰绳的手。“这是多夫之子夏嘎的马。”他朝马厩小厮咆哮。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5160');"><p>"If he doesn’t give her back, chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats," Tyrion promised. "Provided you can find some."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5160" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果他不把马还你，就剁掉他的命根子，拿去喂山羊。”提利昂保证，“不过你得先找到山羊。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5161');"><p>A pair of house guards in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms stood under the inn’s sign, on either side of the door. Tyrion recognized their captain. "My father?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5161" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>旅店招牌下站了两个红袍狮盔的卫士，一左一右看守着门。提利昴认出了侍卫队长。“我父亲人呢?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5162');"><p>"In the common room, m’lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5162" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在大厅里，大人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5163');"><p>"My men will want meat and mead," Tyrion told him. "See that they get it." He entered the inn, and there was Father.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5163" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的人需要吃喝，”提利昂告诉他，“交给你打点。”他走进旅店，立刻看到了父亲。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5164');"><p>Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, was in his middle fifties, yet hard as a man of twenty. Even seated, he was tall, with long legs, broad shoulders, a flat stomach. His thin arms were corded with muscle. When his once-thick golden hair had begun to recede, he had commanded his barber to shave his head; Lord Tywin did not believe in half measures. He razored his lip and chin as well, but kept his side-whiskers, two great thickets of wiry golden hair that covered most of his cheeks from ear to jaw. His eyes were a pale green, flecked with gold. A fool more foolish than most had once jested that even Lord Tywin’s shit was flecked with gold. Some said the man was still alive, deep in the bowels of Casterly Rock.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5164" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>身兼凯岩城公爵与西境守护二职的泰温•兰尼斯特现年五十多岁，却健壮得像个二十岁的小伙子。即便坐着，他依旧显得身躯高大，两腿颀长，肩膀宽厚，小腹平坦，手臂虽细却肌肉结实。自从原本蓬厚的金发开始渐渐稀少后，他便命令理发师把他剃成光头；泰温公爵是个做事果敢决断的人，因此他也把唇边和下巴的胡子通通刮干净，只留两颊鬓须，两大丛结实的金胡子从双耳一直覆到下颚。他的眼睛淡绿中带着金黄。曾经有个愚蠢的弄臣开玩笑说泰温大人连拉的屎里都有黄金——此人据说还活着，不过住在凯岩城最深处的地牢里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5165');"><p>Ser Kevan Lannister, his father’s only surviving brother, was sharing a flagon of ale with Lord Tywin when Tyrion entered the common room. His uncle was portly and balding, with a close-cropped yellow beard that followed the line of his massive jaw. Ser Kevan saw him first. "Tyrion," he said in surprise.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5165" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂走进旅店大厅时，泰温公爵正和他仅存的手足——凯冯•兰尼斯特爵士喝着一瓶麦酒。叔叔有些发胖，头也快秃了，下巴全是肉，黄胡子修剪得很短。凯冯爵士首先看到他。“提利昂?”他惊讶地说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5166');"><p>"Uncle," Tyrion said, bowing. "And my lord father. What a pleasure to find you here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5166" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“叔叔，”提利昂一鞠躬，“父亲大人。见到你们真好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5167');"><p>Lord Tywin did not stir from his chair, but he did give his dwarf son a long, searching look. "I see that the rumors of your demise were unfounded."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5167" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>泰温公爵并未起身，他只意味深长地打量了侏儒儿子一番。“看来关于你已死的传言不攻自破了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5168');"><p>"Sorry to disappoint you, Father," Tyrion said. "No need to leap up and embrace me, I wouldn’t want you to strain yourself." He crossed the room to their table, acutely conscious of the way his stunted legs made him waddle with every step. Whenever his father’s eyes were on him, he became uncomfortably aware of all his deformities and shortcomings. "Kind of you to go to war for me," he said as he climbed into a chair and helped himself to a cup of his father’s ale.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5168" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真抱歉让您失望，父亲大人。”提利昂说，“千万不用跳起来拥抱我，我可不希望您扭到腰。”他穿过房间，走到桌边，一边走一边觉得自己畸形的腿摇摇摆摆、格外醒目。只要父亲的视线一刻停留在他身上，他就很不自在地想起自己所有的畸形和缺陷。“非常感谢您为我出兵打仗。”说着，他爬上一张椅子，自顾自地拿起父亲的酒瓶倒酒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5169');"><p>"By my lights, it was you who started this," Lord Tywin replied. "Your brother Jaime would never have meekly submitted to capture at the hands of a woman."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5169" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“得了吧，乱局都是你挑起的。”泰温公爵回答，“换成你哥哥詹姆，他绝不会屈服于一介妇人之手。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5170');"><p>"That’s one way we differ, Jaime and I. He’s taller as well, you may have noticed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5170" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这就是詹姆和我的不同之一啦。他还比我高呢，如果您注意到的话。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5171');"><p>His father ignored the sally. "The honor of our House was at stake. I had no choice but to ride. No man sheds Lannister blood with impunity."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5171" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲没理会他的俏皮话。“事关家族荣誉，除了出兵，我别无选择。让兰尼斯特家人流血的人，必受惩罚，休想全身而退!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5172');"><p>"Hear Me Roar," Tyrion said, grinning. The Lannister words. "Truth be told, none of my blood was actually shed, although it was a close thing once or twice. Morrec and Jyck were killed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5172" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“听我怒吼。”提利昂嘻嘻笑道，这是兰尼斯特家族的箴言。“说真的，其实我半滴血都没流，虽然有几次很接近。莫里斯和杰克却死了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5173');"><p>"I suppose you will be wanting some new men."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5173" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“所以你需要新手下?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5174');"><p>"Don’t trouble yourself, Father, I’ve acquired a few of my own." He tried a swallow of the ale. It was brown and yeasty, so thick you could almost chew it. Very fine, in truth. A pity his father had hanged the innkeep. "How is your war going?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5174" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“父亲大人，这就不用劳烦您了，我自己找了几个。”他试着咽下麦酒，酒是褐色，充满发酵的味道，非常浓，浓到几乎能咀嚼，不过的确香醇之极，真可惜父亲把老板娘给吊死了。“您的战事进展如何? ”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5175');"><p>His uncle answered. "Well enough, for the nonce. Ser Edmure had scattered small troops of men along his borders to stop our raiding, and your lord father and I were able to destroy most of them piecemeal before they could regroup."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5175" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>作答的是叔叔，“到目前为止，还算顺利。艾德慕爵士将人马分散为小队，派到领土边界阻止我方突袭，你父亲大人和我在他们会合之前，就将其大部各个击破。”
