</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3854');"><p>They had taken shelter beneath a copse of aspens just off the high road. Tyrion was gathering deadwood while their horses took water from a mountain stream. He stooped to pick up a splintered branch and examined it critically. "Will this do? I am not practiced at starting fires. Morrec did that for me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3854" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们在紧邻山路的山杨树丛下稍事休息。提利昂捡拾枯枝，马匹则啜饮山泉。他俯身拿起一根断裂的枝干仔细审视。“这个行吗？我对生火这事儿不在行，以前都是莫里斯帮我弄的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3855');"><p>"A fire?" Bronn said, spitting. "Are you so hungry to die, dwarf? Or have you taken leave of your senses? A fire will bring the clansmen down on us from miles around. I mean to survive this journey, Lannister."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3855" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“生火？”波隆啐了口唾沫，“侏儒，你急着找死不成？还是你走得连理臹都没啦？生火会把方圆好几里的原住民通通吸引过来。兰尼斯特，我还想活着走完这趟路呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3856');"><p>"And how do you hope to do that?" Tyrion asked. He tucked the branch under his arm and poked around through the sparse undergrowth, looking for more. His back ached from the effort of bending; they had been riding since daybreak, when a stone-faced Ser Lyn Corbray had ushered them through the Bloody Gate and commanded them never to return.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3856" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那你倒是打算怎么办?”提利昂问。他把树枝夹在腋下，继续在稀疏的灌木丛中翻找。天刚亮，林恩•科布瑞爵士便铁青着脸把他们送出血门，并明令禁止他们再度出现，从那时起，他俩便快马加鞭地赶路，直到现在还没歇息，害得他腰酸背痛。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3857');"><p>"We have no chance of fighting our way back," Bronn said, "but two can cover more ground than ten, and attract less notice. The fewer days we spend in these mountains, the more like we are to reach the riverlands. Ride hard and fast, I say. Travel by night and hole up by day, avoid the road where we can, make no noise and light no fires."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3857" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“靠蛮干杀出重围是别想了，”波隆道，“但两个人轻装便行，总比大批人马速度快，也较不会引人注意。我们在山里停留的时间越短，就越有机会安全抵达河问地带。所以我说咱们应该加紧赶路，白天躲藏，夜间行动，道路能避就避，不要发出噪音，更不要生火。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3858');"><p>Tyrion Lannister sighed. "A splendid plan, Bronn. Try it, as you like?.?.?.?and forgive me if I do not linger to bury you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3858" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂•兰尼斯特叹道：“波隆，这计划真是好极了。那你就自己去试试罢……到时候可别怪我没停下来帮你挖坟。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3859');"><p>"You think to outlive me, dwarf?" The sellsword grinned. He had a dark gap in his smile where the edge of Ser Vardis Egen’s shield had cracked a tooth in half.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3859" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你这侏儒想活得比我久？”佣兵嘿嘿笑道。他的笑容有个缺口，正是瓦狄斯•伊根爵士的盾牌撞掉他一颗牙齿的地方。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3860');"><p>Tyrion shrugged. "Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your skull. I prefer to make my crossing slow and easy. I know you love the taste of horse, Bronn, but if our mounts die under us this time, we’ll be trying to saddle shadowcats?.?.?.?and if truth be told, I think the clans will find us no matter what we do. Their eyes are all around us." He swept a gloved hand over the high, wind-carved crags that surrounded them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3860" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂耸耸肩。“你要在夜间加紧赶路，这简直就是想摔破脑袋。我宁可慢慢走，舒舒服服地走。波隆，我知道你爱吃马肉，但这回要是我的马死了，咱俩就只剩影子山猫可骑了……老实说，我认为不管我们怎么做，原住民都会找上我们。这里四处都是他们的眼线。”他伸出戴了手套的手，朝周围风蚀的高耸峭壁挥挥。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3861');"><p>Bronn grimaced. "Then we’re dead men, Lannister."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3861" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>波隆皱眉道：“兰尼斯特，那我们就跟死人没两样了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3862');"><p>"If so, I prefer to die comfortable," Tyrion replied. "We need a fire. The nights are cold up here, and hot food will warm our bellies and lift our spirits. Do you suppose there’s any game to be had? Lady Lysa has kindly provided us with a veritable feast of salt beef, hard cheese, and stale bread, but I would hate to break a tooth so far from the nearest maester."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3862" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真那样的话，我也宁愿死得舒服点。”提利昂回答，“我们需要生个火，这里入夜之后冷死人，热腾腾的食物不仅可以温暖咱们的肚皮，还可以提振精神。你觉得这附近能打到什么野味？莱莎夫人好心地给我们准备了丰盛的咸牛肉、硬乳酪和干面包大餐，但我实在不想在这里咬断牙齿，你知道，要找学士还有得走咧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3863');"><p>"I can find meat." Beneath a fall of black hair, Bronn’s dark eyes regarded Tyrion suspiciously. "I should leave you here with your fool’s fire. If I took your horse, I’d have twice the chance to make it through. What would you do then, dwarf?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3863" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我能弄到肉，”一绺黑发之下，波隆的黑眼睛狐疑地打量着提利昂。“但我首先应该把你和这堆笨柴火丢在这里，如果我把你的马也带走，那我逃脱的机会就会加倍。到时候你会怎么做呢，侏儒先生？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3864');"><p>"Die, most like." Tyrion stooped to get another stick.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3864" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“八成是死啰。”提利昂弯腰捡起另一根木棍。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3865');"><p>"You don’t think I’d do it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3865" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你觉得我不会这么做？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3866');"><p>"You’d do it in an instant, if it meant your life. You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly." Bronn had yanked back the man’s head by the hair and driven the point of his dirk in under the ear, and afterward told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had died of his wound.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3866" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果攸关性命，你会毫不犹豫这么做。当初你朋友契根肚子中箭，你不就动作飞快，一刀把他宰了？”当时波隆抓住他的头发往后一扯，匕首从他耳朵贯穿而进，事后他却对凯特琳•史塔克说他的佣兵同伴死于箭伤。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3867');"><p>"He was good as dead," Bronn said, "and his moaning was bringing them down on us. Chiggen would have done the same for me?.?.?.?and he was no friend, only a man I rode with. Make no mistake, dwarf. I fought for you, but I do not love you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3867" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“反正他也活不成，”波隆道，“更何况他大呼小叫个不停，把敌人都引来了。那天受伤的换做我，契根也会同样行为……何况他算不上朋友，只是同行的伙伴。侏儒，你给我搞清楚，我帮你杀人，但那不代表我喜欢你。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3868');"><p>"It was your blade I needed," Tyrion said, "not your love." He dumped his armful of wood on the ground.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3868" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我也只需要你帮我杀人，”提利昂说，“用不着你喜欢我。”他把怀中的木材扔到地上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3869');"><p>Bronn grinned. "You’re bold as any sellsword, I’ll give you that. How did you know I’d take your part?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3869" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>波隆嘿嘿一笑。“我得承认，你胆子够大，不输咱们佣兵。你怎么知道我会替你出场？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3870');"><p>"Know?" Tyrion squatted awkwardly on his stunted legs to build the fire. "I tossed the dice. Back at the inn, you and Chiggen helped take me captive. Why? The others saw it as their duty, for the honor of the lords they served, but not you two. You had no lord, no duty, and precious little honor, so why trouble to involve yourselves?" He took out his knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of the sticks he’d gathered, to serve as kindling. "Well, why do sellswords do anything? For gold. You were thinking Lady Catelyn would reward you for your help, perhaps even take you into her service. Here, that should do, I hope. Do you have a flint?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3870" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我哪儿知道？”提利昂瘸着腿试图生火。“我是孤注一掷。之前在旅店里，你和契根跟他们一道把我抓住，图什么？其他人要么是因为职责所在，要么是为了主子的名誉，但你俩不是。你既没有主子，也没有义务，更没有什么宝贝荣誉，何苦没事找事？”他取出刀子，削掉一根木棍的树皮，用来当引信。“喏，佣兵是为什么做事啊？还不是为了钱。你们以为凯特琳夫人会奖赏你们的协助，甚至给你们谋个差事。好了，我想这样应该就行了。你有没有打火石？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3871');"><p>Bronn slid two fingers into the pouch at his belt and tossed down a flint. Tyrion caught it in the air.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3871" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>波隆伸出两根手指滑进腰间的小袋，丢出一块打火石。提利昂在半空中接住。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3872');"><p>"My thanks," he said. "The thing is, you did not know the Starks. Lord Eddard is a proud, honorable, and honest man, and his lady wife is worse. Oh, no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over, and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste, but that’s the most you could have hoped for. The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them, and if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum." Tyrion struck the flint against his dagger, trying for a spark. Nothing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3872" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谢啦。”他说，“问题在于你不了解史塔克家的人。艾德大人既骄傲，又正直，凡事讲求荣誉，而他夫人嘛就更别提了。喏，等事情结束后她当然会赏你两个小钱，带着嫌恶的眼神，一边把钱塞到你手里，一边说几句礼貌的话，但别指望她会给更多啦。史塔克家要的是有忠诚有勇气，还得讲究荣誉的人，而你和契根嘛，老实说，不过是出身低贱的人渣。”提利昂拿燧石敲击匕首想生火，却什么也没弄出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3873');"><p>Bronn snorted. "You have a bold tongue, little man. One day someone is like to cut it out and make you eat it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3873" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>波隆哼了一声。“小家伙，我看你这舌头挺毒的，小心哪天给人割了叫你吞下肚去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3874');"><p>"Everyone tells me that." Tyrion glanced up at the sellsword. "Did I offend you? My pardons?.?.?.?but you are scum, Bronn, make no mistake. Duty, honor, friendship, what’s that to you? No, don’t trouble yourself, we both know the answer. Still, you’re not stupid. Once we reached the Vale, Lady Stark had no more need of you?.?.?.?but I did, and the one thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold. When the moment came to toss the dice, I was counting on your being smart enough to know where your best interest lay. Happily for me, you did." He slammed stone and steel together again, fruitlessly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3874" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别人都这么说。”提利昂瞄瞄佣兵。“我冒犯到你了吗？那还真对不住……不过哩，波隆，你也搞清楚，你的的确确是个人渣。责任感、荣誉心、友谊，哪一样是你有的？哼，不用费工夫想了，答案咱俩都知道。可你不蠢，我们抵达峡谷之后，史塔克夫人就用不着你了……但我用得着，何况兰尼斯特家的人从不吝惜金子。所以，当我需要孤注一掷时，我就是猜你够机灵，知道怎么做对你最有利。让我很高兴的是，你的确够机灵。”他将打火石和刀刃再度撞击，却依旧徒劳无功。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3875');"><p>"Here," said Bronn, squatting, "I’ll do it." He took the knife and flint from Tyrion’s hands and struck sparks on his first try. A curl of bark began to smolder.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3875" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“拿来，”波隆蹲下身，“让我来。”他从提利昂手里接过短刀和燧石，一打便擦出火花。一块卷起的树皮开始冒烟。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3876');"><p>"Well done," Tyrion said. "Scum you may be, but you’re undeniably useful, and with a sword in your hand you’re almost as good as my brother Jaime. What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Land? Women? Keep me alive, and you’ll have it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3876" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“干得好。”提利昂道，“你虽然是个人渣，但不可否认你很有用。手里再拿把剑，你就跟我老哥詹姆差不多厉害。波隆，你想要什么？金子？土地？还是女人？只要想办法保全我性命，你要什么有什么。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3877');"><p>Bronn blew gently on the fire, and the flames leapt up higher. "And if you die?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3877" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>波隆朝火堆轻轻吹气，火焰顿时跃得老高。“万一你死了怎么办？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3878');"><p>"Why then, I’ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere," Tyrion said, grinning. "The gold ends when I do."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3878" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那样嘛，起码有了个真心诚意为我哀悼的人。”提利昂嘻嘻笑道，“我挂了，金子也就没啰。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3879');"><p>The fire was blazing up nicely. Bronn stood, tucked the flint back into his pouch, and tossed Tyrion his dagger. "Fair enough," he said. "My sword’s yours, then?.?.?.?but don’t go looking for me to bend the knee and m’lord you every time you take a shit. I’m no man’s toady."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3879" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时火已经烧得很旺。波隆起身，把燧石塞进口袋，然后将匕首抛回给提利昂。“算你公道，”他说，“我的剑是你的了……但别叫我来卑躬屈膝、满口老爷大人那套，我不当别人的仆从。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3880');"><p>"Nor any man’s friend," Tyrion said. "I’ve no doubt you’d betray me as quick as you did Lady Stark, if you saw a profit in it. If the day ever comes when you’re tempted to sell me out, remember this, Bronn, I’ll match their price, whatever it is. I like living. And now, do you think you could do something about finding us some supper?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3880" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你也不当别人的朋友，”提利昂道，“我很清楚一旦有利可图，你会义无返顾地背叛我，就跟你背叛史塔克夫人一样。波隆，要是哪天真有人引诱你出卖我，请你记住——不管对方出价多少，我都付得起。说穿了，就是我很爱惜我这条命。好啦，那你现在到底能不能帮咱们弄点好吃的？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3881');"><p>"Take care of the horses," Bronn said, unsheathing the long dirk he wore at his hip. He strode into the trees.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3881" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你把马照顾好。”波隆说着解开系在身后的猎刀，大步走进树林。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3882');"><p>An hour later the horses had been rubbed down and fed, the fire was crackling away merrily, and a haunch of a young goat was turning above the flames, spitting and hissing. "All we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid," Tyrion said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3882" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一个小时后，马匹已经刷洗喂饱，营火也烧得劈啪作响，火上的烤架正转着一只小山羊，滴下油汁，香气四溢。“现在只差一瓶好酒配着下肚啦。”提利昂说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3883');"><p>"That, a woman, and another dozen swords," Bronn said. He sat cross-legged beside the fire, honing the edge of his longsword with an oilstone. There was something strangely reassuring about the rasping sound it made when he drew it down the steel. "It will be full dark soon," the sellsword pointed out. "I’ll take first watch?.?.?.?for all the good it will do us. It might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3883" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还要来个女人，最好再多十来个士兵保护我们。”波隆道。他两脚盘坐在火边，正拿油石磨长剑。石头和金属摩擦所发出的刺耳声响有种怪异的安全感。“很快天就要全黑，”佣兵表示， “第一班我来值……虽然没什么用，好歹待会儿我可以死在睡梦中。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3884');"><p>"Oh, I imagine they’ll be here long before it comes to sleep." The smell of the roasting meat made Tyrion’s mouth water.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3884" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喔，我看用不着等到睡着，他们就会过来了。”闻着烤肉的香气，提利昂不禁口水直流。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3885');"><p>Bronn watched him across the fire. "You have a plan," he said flatly, with a scrape of steel on stone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3885" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>波隆隔着营火盯着他。“你有打算。”他平板地说，石头又磨了剑一下。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3886');"><p>"A hope, call it," Tyrion said. "Another toss of the dice."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3886" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不妨说有一丝希望罢，”提利昂道，“又到孤注一掷的时候了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3887');"><p>"With our lives as the stake?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3887" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你拿咱俩的性命当赌注？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3888');"><p>Tyrion shrugged. "What choice do we have?" He leaned over the fire and sawed a thin slice of meat from the kid. "Ahhhh," he sighed happily as he chewed. Grease ran down his chin. "A bit tougher than I’d like, and in want of spicing, but I’ll not complain too loudly. If I were back at the Eyrie, I’d be dancing on a precipice in hopes of a boiled bean."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3888" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂耸耸肩。“难道有别的选择？”他伸手从火上割下一小片羊肉。“啊。”他一边咀嚼，一边开心地感叹。油汁从他两颊滴下。“虽然有点硬，又没有酱料，但我还是不抱怨的好。之前在鹰巢城，我在断崖边跳来跳去，连一粒煮豆子都吃不到哩。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3889');"><p>"And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold," Bronn said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3889" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“结果你却给了那狱卒一袋金子。”波隆说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3890');"><p>"A Lannister always pays his debts."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3890" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“兰尼斯特有债必还。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3891');"><p>Even Mord had scarcely believed it when Tyrion tossed him the leather purse. The gaoler’s eyes had gone big as boiled eggs as he yanked open the drawstring and beheld the glint of gold. "I kept the silver," Tyrion had told him with a crooked smile, "but you were promised the gold, and there it is." It was more than a man like Mord could hope to earn in a lifetime of abusing prisoners. "And remember what I said, this is only a taste. If you ever grow tired of Lady Arryn’s service, present yourself at Casterly Rock, and I’ll pay you the rest of what I owe you." With golden dragons spilling out of both hands, Mord had fallen to his knees and promised that he would do just that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3891" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当提利昂把装了金子的皮袋扔给莫德时，连莫德自己都难以置信。狱卒松开袋口的绳子，看到耀眼黄金，两眼睁得像煮蛋那么大。“我把银币留了下来，”提利昂对他歪嘴一笑。“我们本来就说好给金子，所以就成交啰。”那笔钱是莫德欺负一辈子犯人都挣不到的数目。“还有，别忘记我说过，这些只是开胃小菜。哪天你要是觉得烦，不想继续为艾林夫人做事，就到凯岩城来，到时候我再把欠你的算清。”眼看两手盛满金龙币，莫德当场就双脚跪下，保证他一定会照办。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3892');"><p>Bronn yanked out his dirk and pulled the meat from the fire. He began to carve thick chunks of charred meat off the bone as Tyrion hollowed out two heels of stale bread to serve as trenchers. "If we do reach the river, what will you do then?" the sellsword asked as he cut.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3892" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>波隆抽出匕首，将肉从火堆上拿下，开始从骨头上切下一块块烤得焦黑的肉，提利昂则挖空两块硬面包充当盘子。“假如我们真能回到河间地，你打算做什么？”佣兵边切边问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3893');"><p>"Oh, a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine, for a start." Tyrion held out his trencher, and Bronn filled it with meat. "And then to Casterly Rock or King’s Landing, I think. I have some questions that want answering, concerning a certain dagger."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3893" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喏，先找个妓女，弄张羽毛床，来壶好酒再说。”提利昂递出盘子，波隆将之装满肉块。 “然后再决定去凯岩城或者君临，等我想想，关于某把匕首，可有好些问题要问呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3894');"><p>The sellsword chewed and swallowed. "So you were telling it true? It was not your knife?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3894" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佣兵咀嚼吞咽着满口烤肉。“这么说来你没撒谎？那真不是你的刀子？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3895');"><p>Tyrion smiled thinly. "Do I look a liar to you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3895" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂挤出一丝微笑。“你觉得我看起来可像个骗子？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3896');"><p>By the time their bellies were full, the stars had come out and a halfmoon was rising over the mountains. Tyrion spread his shadowskin cloak on the ground and stretched out with his saddle for a pillow. "Our friends are taking their sweet time."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3896" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>待他们填饱肚子，夜空已群星密布，一弯新月升上山头。提利昂将他的山猫皮披风铺在地上，拿马鞍当枕头。“等啊等啊，咱们朋友还没动静，真是好事多磨。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3897');"><p>"If I were them, I’d fear a trap," Bronn said. "Why else would we be so open, if not to lure them in?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3897" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“换做是我，也会担心其中有诈，”波隆道，“要不是有陷阱，干嘛这样大刺刺的？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3898');"><p>Tyrion chuckled. "Then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror." He began to whistle a tune.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3898" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂咯咯笑道：“那我们岂不更该唱歌跳舞，好把他们通通吓跑啰。”说完他哼起了小调。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3899');"><p>"You’re mad, dwarf," Bronn said as he cleaned the grease out from under his nails with his dirk.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3899" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“侏儒，你真是疯了。”波隆边说边用匕首剔除指甲缝里的油脂。

The first girl I ever bedded used to sing it, and I’ve never been able to put it out of my head." Tyrion gazed up at the sky. It was a clear cold night and the stars shone down upon the mountains as bright and merciless as truth. "I met her on a night like this," he heard himself saying. "Jaime and I were riding back from Lannisport when we heard a scream, and she came running out into the road with two men dogging her heels, shouting threats. My brother unsheathed his sword and went after them, while I dismounted to protect the girl. She was scarcely a year older than I was, dark-haired, slender, with a face that would break your heart. It certainly broke mine. Lowborn, half-starved, unwashed?.?.?.?yet lovely. They’d torn the rags she was wearing half off her back, so I wrapped her in my cloak while Jaime chased the men into the woods. By the time he came trotting back, I’d gotten a name out of her, and a story. She was a crofter’s child, orphaned when her father died of fever, on her way to?.?.?.?well, nowhere, really.

I dared not bring my bride home to Casterly Rock, so I set her up in a cottage of her own, and for a fortnight we played at being man and wife. And then the septon sobered and confessed all to my lord father." Tyrion was surprised at how desolate it made him feel to say it, even after all these years. Perhaps he was just tired. "That was the end of my marriage." He sat up and stared at the dying fire, blinking at the light.

The smoke was stinging his eyes. Tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the fire, to gaze out into darkness. "Lord Tywin had me go last," he said in a quiet voice. "And he gave me a gold coin to pay her, because I was a Lannister, and worth more."
