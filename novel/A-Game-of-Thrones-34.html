</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3002');"><p>Robert, I beg of you," Ned pleaded, "hear what you are saying. You are talking of murdering a child."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3002" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃，求求你，”奈德恳求，“请你仔细想清楚，你这是谋害幼儿啊！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3003');"><p>"The whore is pregnant!" The king’s fist slammed down on the council table loud as a thunderclap. "I warned you this would happen, Ned. Back in the barrowlands, I warned you, but you did not care to hear it. Well, you’ll hear it now. I want them dead, mother and child both, and that fool Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them dead."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3003" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那贱货怀孕了！”国王重重一拳捶在议事桌上，声响如雷。“奈德，这事我早警告过你，记得吗？还在荒冢地的时候我就说过，可你不肯听。那好，现在你给我听清楚：我要他们死，母子两个一起死，外加那个笨蛋韦赛里斯。这样说够明白了吧？我要他们死。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3004');"><p>The other councillors were all doing their best to pretend that they were somewhere else. No doubt they were wiser than he was. Eddard Stark had seldom felt quite so alone. "You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3004" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其余重臣正竭尽所能假装不在现常他们这么做，无疑比他聪明得多。艾德•史塔克极少感到如此孤独。“假如你真这样做，你将遗臭万年。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3005');"><p>"Then let it be on my head, so long as it is done. I am not so blind that I cannot see the shadow of the axe when it is hanging over my own neck."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3005" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要怪就尽量怪到我头上来吧，只要事情能办成。我还没盲目到斧头的影子都在脖子上晃了自己还看不到的地步。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3006');"><p>"There is no axe," Ned told his king. "Only the shadow of a shadow, twenty years removed?.?.?.?if it exists at all."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3006" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“根本没有什么斧头，”奈德告诉他的国王：“只有二十年前的陈年旧事，你这是在捕风捉影……而且究竟有没有影子还未可知。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3007');"><p>"If?" Varys asked softly, wringing powdered hands together. "My lord, you wrong me. Would I bring ties to king and council?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3007" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还未可知？”瓦里斯轻声问，一边扭着他那双洒满香粉的手。“大人，您错怪我了。难道我会编造假消息来欺骗国王陛下和诸位大人吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3008');"><p>Ned looked at the eunuch coldly. "You would bring us the whisperings of a traitor half a world away, my lord. Perhaps Mormont is wrong. Perhaps he is lying."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3008" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德冷冷地看着太监。“大人，您的消息来源于千里之外的叛徒。或许莫尔蒙弄错了，或许他在撒谎。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3009');"><p>"Ser Jorah would not dare deceive me," Varys said with a sly smile. "Rely on it, my lord. The princess is with child."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3009" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“乔拉爵士想必不敢骗我，”瓦里斯露出狡猾的笑容。“请放心吧，大人，公主怀孕的事不会错的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3010');"><p>"So you say. If you are wrong, we need not fear. If the girl miscarries, we need not fear. If she births a daughter in place of a son, we need not fear. If the babe dies in infancy, we need not fear."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3010" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这可是你说的。若你弄错了，我们无须害怕；若那女孩流产，我们无须害怕；若她生的是女儿，并非儿子，我们无须害怕；若那孩子还未长大就死于襁褓，我们也无须害怕。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3011');"><p>"But if it is a boy?" Robert insisted. "If he lives?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3011" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“但万一真是个儿子呢？”劳勃坚持，“万一他活下来了呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3012');"><p>"The narrow sea would still lie between us. I shall fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3012" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“狭海依旧隔在中间。等多斯拉克人教会他们的马在水上走路的那一天，我才会害怕。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3013');"><p>The king took a swallow of wine and glowered at Ned across the council table. "So you would counsel me to do nothing until the dragonspawn has landed his army on my shores, is that it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3013" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王灌了口葡萄酒，然后从议事桌的那边狠狠地瞪着这一头的奈德。“你的意思就是让我什么也别做，干等恶龙的孽种带着兵马登岸了再说，是吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3014');"><p>"This ‘dragonspawn’ is in his mother’s belly," Ned said. "Even Aegon did no conquering until after he was weaned."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3014" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您说的这个’恶龙的孽种‘，如今还在娘胎里，”奈德道，“即便是伊耿，也是等断奶之后才南征北讨的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3015');"><p>"Gods! You are stubborn as an aurochs, Stark." The king looked around the council table. "Have the rest of you mislaid your tongues? Will no one talk sense to this frozen-faced fool?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3015" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸神在上！史塔克，你老是这副牛脾气！”国王环顾议事桌。“怎么，都哑巴啦？谁来跟这冻糊涂了的傻瓜讲讲道理？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3016');"><p>Varys gave the king an unctuous smile and laid a soft hand on Ned’s sleeve. "I understand your qualms, Lord Eddard, truly I do. It gave me no joy to bring this grievous news to council. It is a terrible thing we contemplate, a vile thing. Yet we who presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm, howevermuch it pains us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3016" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>瓦里斯朝国王腻腻一笑，然后伸出软绵绵的手放在奈德的袖子上。“艾德大人，凭良心说，我真的能体会您的顾虑。将这消息带给诸位，我自己也不好受。我们讨论的是件可怕的事，是件卑鄙的事，可我们这些冒昧为政的人，凡事必须以全国百姓福祉为优先考量，而不论自身感受如何。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3017');"><p>Lord Renly shrugged. "The matter seems simple enough to me. We ought to have had Viserys and his sister killed years ago, but His Grace my brother made the mistake of listening to Jon Arryn."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3017" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>蓝礼公爵耸肩：“对我来说，这事很简单。韦赛里斯和他妹妹早就该杀，只怪王兄陛下从前错信了琼恩•艾林的话。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3018');"><p>"Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly," Ned replied. "On the Trident, Ser Barristan here cut down a dozen good men, Robert’s friends and mine. When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat, but your brother said, ‘I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well,’ and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan’s wounds." He gave the king a long cool look. "Would that man were here today."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3018" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“蓝礼大人，慈悲为怀绝不是错误。”奈德答道，“当年在三叉戟河上，眼下在座的巴利斯坦爵士独自一人砍倒十几个优秀的勇士，其中有的是劳勃的朋友，有的是我的。当他被押到我们面前时，已经浑身是伤，濒临死亡，卢斯•波顿力主割了他喉咙，但你哥哥却说：‘我不会因为一个人忠心耿耿、英勇作战而杀他。’随后他派出自己的学士为巴利斯坦疗伤。”他冰冷却意味深长地看了国王一眼。“如果今天在场的是那个人就好了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3019');"><p>Robert had shame enough to blush. "It was not the same," he complained. "Ser Barristan was a knight of the Kingsguard."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3019" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃还知道红脸。“那不一样，”他抱怨，“巴利斯坦爵士是御林铁卫的骑士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3020');"><p>"Whereas Daenerys is a fourteen-year-old girl." Ned knew he was pushing this well past the point of wisdom, yet he could not keep silent. "Robert, I ask you, what did we rise against Aerys Targaryen for, if not to put an end to the murder of children?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3020" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“而丹妮莉丝只是个十四岁的小女孩。”奈德知道这样步步进逼很不理臹，然而他无法保持缄默。“劳勃，我问你，当初我们兴兵对抗伊里斯•坦格利安，不就是为了要阻止他继续谋害孩童吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3021');"><p>"To put an end to Targaryens!" the king growled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3021" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们是要杀光坦格利安家的人！”国王咆哮。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3022');"><p>"Your Grace, I never knew you to fear Rhaegar." Ned fought to keep the scorn out of his voice, and failed. "Have the years so unmanned you that you tremble at the shadow of an unborn child?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3022" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“陛下，记得从前连雷加也吓不倒你，”奈德努力克臸口气中的轻蔑，却失败了。“难道经过这么些年，您的胆子却变得如此之小，连个还未出生的孩子的阴影都能让您颤抖了么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3023');"><p>Robert purpled. "No more, Ned," he warned, pointing. "Not another word. Have you forgotten who is king here?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3023" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃脸色发紫。“奈德，不要再说了。”他指着他发出警告，“一个字都不许再说。莫非你忘了谁才是国王？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3024');"><p>"No, Your Grace," Ned replied. "Have you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3024" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“启禀陛下，我没忘。”奈德回答，“敢情您也没忘吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3025');"><p>"Enough!" the king bellowed. "I am sick of talk. I’ll be done with this, or be damned. What say you all?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3025" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“够了！”国王大吼，“我懒得再费口舌。我要是不杀她，必遭天谴。你们意见如何？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3026');"><p>"She must be killed," Lord Renly declared.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3026" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“该杀。”蓝礼公爵表示。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3027');"><p>"We have no choice," murmured Varys. "Sadly, sadly?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3027" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们别无选择，”瓦里斯喃喃道，“可惜啊，可惜……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3028');"><p>Ser Barristan Selmy raised his pale blue eyes from the table and said, "Your Grace, there is honor in facing an enemy on the battlefield, but none in killing him in his mother’s womb. Forgive me, but I must stand with Lord Eddard."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3028" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士从桌上扬起那双淡蓝色的眼睛，“陛下，在战场上与敌人交锋是件光荣的事，但人还没出生就动手却不光彩。请您原谅，我必须站在艾德大人这边。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3029');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat, a process that seemed to take some minutes. "My order serves the realm, not the ruler. Once I counseled King Aerys as loyally as I counsel King Robert now, so I bear this girl child of his no ill will. Yet I ask you this, should war come again, how many soldiers will die? How many towns will burn? How many children will be ripped from their mothers to perish on the end of a spear?" He stroked his luxuriant white beard, infinitely sad, infinitely weary. "Is it not wiser, even kinder, that Daenerys Targaryen should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3029" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔大学士花了好几分钟清喉咙。“我的组织旨在为全国谋福利，而非只为统治者。我曾经忠心耿耿地辅佐伊里斯国王，一如我现在辅佐劳勃国王，所以我对他这个女儿没有恶感。但是我请问您——倘若战事再起，会有多少士兵丧命荒野？多少村庄付之一炬？多少孩子被从母亲怀里硬生生抓走，死于枪下？”他捻捻大把白胡须，一副悲天悯人、疲累不堪的模样。“倘若死了丹妮莉丝一个，能够拯救万千生灵，那会不会是比较明臹，甚或比较仁慈的做法呢？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3030');"><p>"Kinder," Varys said. "Oh, well and truly spoken, Grand Maester. It is so true. Should the gods in their caprice grant Daenerys Targaryen a son, the realm must bleed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3030" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“比较仁慈，”瓦里斯道，“噢，国师大人，说得真好，实在是再正确不过了。的确如此啊，若是天上诸神一个疏忽，给了丹妮莉丝•坦格利安一个儿子，王国就难免血光之灾。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3031');"><p>Littlefinger was the last. As Ned looked to him, Lord Petyr stifled a yawn. "When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, the best thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it," he declared. "Waiting won’t make the maid any prettier. Kiss her and be done with it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3031" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头最后发言。奈德朝他望去时，培提尔伯爵正忍住呵欠。“若你发现跟自己上床的原来是个丑女，最好的做法就是闭上眼睛，赶紧办事。”他高声宣布，“反正等下去她也不会变漂亮，所以还是亲一亲了事啰。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3032');"><p>"Kiss her?" Ser Barristan repeated, aghast.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3032" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“亲一亲？”巴利斯坦爵士骇然地重复。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3033');"><p>"A steel kiss," said Littlefinger.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3033" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“用刀用剑亲哪。”小指头道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3034');"><p>Robert turned to face his Hand. "Well, there it is, Ned. You and Selmy stand alone on this matter. The only question that remains is, who can we find to kill her?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3034" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃转身面对他的首相。“你看，奈德，就这样了。对这件事的看法，只有你和赛尔弥持有异议。剩下的问题是，我们派谁去杀她？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3035');"><p>"Mormont craves a royal pardon," Lord Renly reminded them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3035" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“莫尔蒙极度渴望王家特舎。”蓝礼提醒他们。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3036');"><p>"Desperately," Varys said, "yet he craves life even more. By now, the princess nears Vaes Dothrak, where it is death to draw a blade. If I told you what the Dothraki would do to the poor man who used one on a khaleesi, none of you would sleep tonight." He stroked a powdered cheek. "Now, poison?.?.?.?the tears of Lys, let us say. Khal Drogo need never know it was not a natural death."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3036" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一心一意哪，”瓦里斯道，“但他更渴望生命。如今公主已抵达维斯•多斯拉克，在那里拔剑可是会没命的。若有哪个笨蛋敢在圣城对卡丽熙动刀动枪，他会有什么下场，我要是说出来，各位今晚就不用睡了。”他轻抚扑过粉的脸颊。“除此之外，就是下毒……不如就用里斯之泪。没必要让卓戈卡奥知道是否是自然死亡。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3037');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open. He squinted suspiciously at the eunuch.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3037" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔国师昏昏欲睡的眼睛登时睁得老大，他一脸怀疑地眯眼看着太监。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3038');"><p>"Poison is a coward’s weapon," the king complained.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3038" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“毒药是懦夫的武器。”国王抱怨。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3039');"><p>Ned had heard enough. "You send hired knives to kill a fourteen-year-old girl and still quibble about honor?" He pushed back his chair and stood. "Do it yourself, Robert. The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. Look her in the eyes before you kill her. See her tears, hear her last words. You owe her that much at least."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3039" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德受够了。“你雇人去杀一个十四岁的小女孩，还嫌手段不够光明正大？”他把椅子往后一推，站起来。“劳勃，您亲自动手罢。判人死刑的应该亲自操刀，杀她之前好好注视她的眼睛，看她流泪，聆听她的临终遗言，最起码您应该做到这样。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3040');"><p>"Gods," the king swore, the word exploding out of him as if he could barely contain his fury. "You mean it, damn you." He reached for the flagon of wine at his elbow, found it empty, and flung it away to shatter against the wall. "I am out of wine and out of patience. Enough of this. Just have it done."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3040" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸神在上，”国王咒道。这句话从他嘴里炸出来，仿佛他几乎无法包容怒气。“该死，你真想跟我作对吗？”他伸手拿起肘边的酒壶，却发现是空的，便狠狠将之朝墙上摔去。“我的酒没了，耐性也没了，别再婆婆妈妈，快把事情办妥吧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3041');"><p>"I will not be part of murder, Robert. Do as you will, but do not ask me to fix my seal to it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3041" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃，我决不当谋杀共犯。您要怎么随便您，但休想叫我在上面盖印。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3042');"><p>For a moment Robert did not seem to understand what Ned was saying. Defiance was not a dish he tasted often. Slowly his face changed as comprehension came. His eyes narrowed and a flush crept up his neck past the velvet collar. He pointed an angry finger at Ned. "You are the King’s Hand, Lord Stark. You will do as I command you, or I’ll find me a Hand who will."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3042" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>起初劳勃似乎没听懂奈德的话，他很少尝到被人抗拒的滋味。等他明白过来之后，慢慢变了脸色。他眯起眼睛，一阵红晕爬上脖子，高过天鹅绒领口。他愤怒地伸手指着奈德道：“史塔克大人，你是御前首相，你要么照我说的去做，不然我就另请高明。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3043');"><p>"I wish him every success." Ned unfastened the heavy clasp that clutched at the folds of his cloak, the ornate silver hand that was his badge of office. He laid it on the table in front of the king, saddened by the memory of the man who had pinned it on him, the friend he had loved. "I thought you a better man than this, Robert. I thought we had made a nobler king."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3043" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那我祝他胜任愉快。”奈德说罢解开扣住斗篷、象征他身份地位的雕花银手徽章。他把徽章放在国王面前的桌上，想起那个为自己配上这枚徽章的人，那个他所深爱的朋友，不禁难过起来。“劳勃，我以为您不是这种人。我以为我们拥立了一个更高贵的国王。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3044');"><p>Robert’s face was purple. "Out," he croaked, choking on his rage. "Out, damn you, I’m done with you. What are you waiting for? Go, run back to Winterfell. And make certain I never look on your face again, or I swear, I’ll have your head on a spike!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3044" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃脸色发紫。“给我滚！”他嘶声道，气得差点说不出话。“快给我滚出去，你这该死的家伙，我受够你了。你还等什么？滚，快滚回临冬城去。你这辈子最好再也别叫我瞧见你那张脸，否则……否则我发誓一定把你的头砍下来挂在枪上。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3045');"><p>Ned bowed, and turned on his heel without another word. He could feel Robert’s eyes on his back. As he strode from the council chambers, the discussion resumed with scarcely a pause. "On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless Men," Grand Maester Pycelle offered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3045" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德鞠躬，然后一言不发地离开。他感觉得到劳勃的目光看着自己的背。他还没走出议事厅，讨论便继续进行。“听说布拉佛斯有个叫’无面者‘的组织。”派席尔大学士提议。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3046');"><p>"Do you have any idea how costly they are?" Littlefinger complained. "You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and that’s for a merchant. I don’t dare think what they might ask for a princess."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3046" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你到底知不知道他们的行情？”小指头抱怨：“光半价就够你雇一支寻常佣兵组成的军队，而且行刺对象只是寻常商人。暗杀公主要花多少，我连想都不敢想。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3047');"><p>The closing of the door behind him silenced the voices. Ser Boros Blount was stationed outside the chamber, wearing the long white cloak and armor of the Kingsguard. He gave Ned a quick, curious glance from the corner of his eye, but asked no questions.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3047" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>门在他身后关上，隔绝了声音。柏洛斯•布劳恩爵士守在议事厅外，穿着御林铁卫的纯白长披风和铠甲。他用眼角飞快又狐疑地瞄了奈德一眼，但没有多问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3048');"><p>The day felt heavy and oppressive as he crossed the bailey back to the Tower of the Hand. He could feel the threat of rain in the air. Ned would have welcomed it. It might have made him feel a trifle less unclean. When he reached his solar, he summoned Vayon Poole. The steward came at once. "You sent for me, my lord Hand?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3048" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>天色阴沉而压抑，奈德穿过城堡外庭，回到首相塔。他感觉得出空气中弥漫湿意，仿佛山雨欲来，若真下起雨，他倒会很高兴，或许一场雨，会让他稍稍觉得自己不那么污秽。他进了书房，传维扬•普尔过去。总管立刻赶来。“首相大人，您有何吩咐？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3049');"><p>"Hand no longer," Ned told him. "The king and I have quarreled. We shall be returning to Winterfell."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3049" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我已经不是首相了。”奈德告诉他，“我跟国王吵了一架。我们准备回临冬城。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3050');"><p>"I shall begin making arrangements at once, my lord. We will need a fortnight to ready everything for the journey."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3050" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那我这就去准备，老爷。我们需要两个星期的时间安排旅途。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3051');"><p>"We may not have a fortnight. We may not have a day. The king mentioned something about seeing my head on a spike." Ned frowned. He did not truly believe the king would harm him, not Robert. He was angry now, but once Ned was safely out of sight, his rage would cool as it always did.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3051" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“只怕我们没有两个星期，连有没有一天我都不敢确定。国王甚至说要把我的头挂在枪上。”奈德皱眉。他并不真正相信国王会伤害他，劳勃绝对不会。他当时在气头上，但等奈德离开他的视线，他的怒意自会冷却，从前每次都这样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3052');"><p>Always? Suddenly, uncomfortably, he found himself recalling Rhaegar Targaryen. Fifteen years dead, yet Robert hates him as much as ever. It was a disturbing notion?.?.?.?and there was the other matter, the business with Catelyn and the dwarf that Yoren had warned him of last night. That would come to light soon, as sure as sunrise, and with the king in such a black fury?.?.?.?Robert might not care a fig for Tyrion Lannister, but it would touch on his pride, and there was no telling what the queen might do.

The rest of you can follow when you are ready. Inform Jory, but tell no one else, and do nothing until the girls and I have gone. The castle is full of eyes and ears, and I would rather my plans were not known."

It would be good to return to Winterfell. He ought never have left. His sons were waiting there. Perhaps he and Catelyn would make a new son together when he returned, they were not so old yet. And of late he had often found himself dreaming of snow, of the deep quiet of the wolfswood at night.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3055" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他走后，艾德•史塔克踱到窗边，坐下来沉思。是劳勃让他别无选择。其实他倒该感谢他，能回临冬城是件好事，他打一开始便不该离开。儿子们都在那儿等他。回去以后，他说不定可以跟凯特琳再生个儿子，他们都还不老呢。近来他时常梦见雪，以及狼林夜间深沉的静谧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3056');"><p>And yet, the thought of leaving angered him as well. So much was still undone. Robert and his council of cravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if left unchecked?.?.?.?or, worse, sell it to the Lannisters in payment of their loans. And the truth of Jon Arryn’s death still eluded him. Oh, he had found a few pieces, enough to convince him that Jon had indeed been murdered, but that was no more than the spoor of an animal on the forest floor. He had not sighted the beast itself yet, though he sensed it was there, lurking, hidden, treacherous.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3056" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可另一方面，想到离开却又叫他恼怒。好多事都还未完成。若不加以管束，劳勃和他满朝的懦夫和马屁精会闹得民穷国枯……甚至可能为了还债，把国家都卖给兰尼斯特。至于琼恩•艾林的死亡之谜，则始终困扰着他。噢，他的确找到些线索，足以让他相信琼恩确是遭人谋害，但那不过是林中野兽留下的一鳞半爪。他还未亲眼目睹野兽本身，然而他感觉得到，它就在那里，潜伏、躲藏、狡诈。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3057');"><p>It struck him suddenly that he might return to Winterfell by sea. Ned was no sailor, and ordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad, but if he took ship he could stop at Dragonstone and speak with Stannis Baratheon. Pycelle had sent a raven off across the water, with a polite letter from Ned requesting Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the small council. As yet, there had been no reply, but the silence only deepened his suspicions. Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for, he was certain of it. The truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the ancient island fortress of House Targaryen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3057" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他突然想到，或许自己应该走海路回临冬城。奈德不谙水性，正常状况下宁可走国王大道，但他若是乘船，则可在龙石岛停靠，和史坦尼斯•拜拉席恩谈谈。派席尔已经送了只乌鸦飞越狭海，带上奈德的一封信，信中礼貌地请求史坦尼斯公爵回到朝中奉职，却至今没有回音。对方的沉默只加深了他的怀疑。史坦尼斯一定知道琼恩•艾林何以丧命的秘密，这点他很确定。他所冀求的事实真相，很可能就在坦格利安家族的古老岛屿要塞里等着他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3058');"><p>And when you have it, what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust. Ned slid the dagger that Catelyn had brought him out of the sheath on his belt. The Imp’s knife. Why would the dwarf want Bran dead? To silence him, surely. Another secret, or only a different strand of the same web?
</p></origin><translate id="div_3058" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就算你查出真相，又能怎么样呢？有些秘密最好永远埋藏，有些秘密太危险，不能与他人分享，即便是那些你所深爱和相信的人。奈德从腰际的刀鞘里抽出凯特琳带来的那把匕首。小恶魔的刀。那侏儒为何会要置布兰于死地？想必是为了叫他永远闭嘴。这是又一个秘密，还是同一张蛛网上不同的丝线？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3059');"><p>Could Robert be part of it? He would not have thought so, but once he would not have thought Robert could command the murder of women and children either. Catelyn had tried to warn him. You knew the man, she had said. The king is a stranger to you. The sooner he was quit of King’s Landing, the better. If there was a ship sailing north on the morrow, it would be well to be on it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3059" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这其中劳勃有份吗？他不会这么想，但从前他也不会想到劳勃竟干得出谋害妇孺的事。凯特琳警告过他，你清楚的是过去的他。当时她说，现在的国王对你而言，已经成了陌生人。看来他越快离开君临越好，假如明天刚好有北上的船只，能搭上是再好不过。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3060');"><p>He summoned Vayon Poole again and sent him to the docks to make inquiries, quietly but quickly. "Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain," he told the steward. "I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments, so long as it is swift and safe. I wish to leave at once."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3060" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是他再次找来维扬•普尔，吩咐他去港口询问，不能张扬但动作要快。“帮我找条快船，得有经验丰富的船长。”他告诉管家，“我不在乎船舱大小或豪华与否，只要迅速安全就成。我打算即刻动身。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3061');"><p>Poole had no sooner taken his leave than Tomard announced a visitor. "Lord Baelish to see you, m’lord."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3065');"><p>"I won’t detain you long, I’m on my way to dine with Lady Tanda. Lamprey pie and roast suckling pig.

</p></origin><translate id="div_3065" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不会打扰您太久的，我正要去参加坦妲伯爵夫人安排的晚餐，这是碰巧路过。七鳃鳗派和烤乳猪。她有意把小女儿嫁给我，所以桌上的菜总是很出彩。不过说实话，我还宁愿娶头猪。噢，这事可别告诉她，我可是真心喜欢鳗鱼派哪。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3066');"><p>"Don’t let me keep you from your eels, my lord," Ned said with icy disdain. "At the moment, I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3066" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，那就别让我耽误了你的鳗鱼美食。”奈德带着冷冷的嫌恶道，“此时此刻，我想不出还有谁更让我不愿与之为伍。”

</p></origin><translate id="div_3067" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“噢，我相信你只要努力想，一定可以想出几个。比方说，瓦里斯，瑟曦，或是劳勃。陛下他很生你的气，今早上你走之后，他还接着骂了一通。倘若我没记错的话，他的话中反复出现傲慢无礼、忘恩负义这些字眼哟。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3068');"><p>Ned did not honor that with a reply. Nor did he offer his guest a seat, but Littlefinger took one anyway. "After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire the Faceless Men," he continued blithely. "Instead Varys will quietly let it be known that we’ll make a lord of whoever does in the Targaryen girl."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3068" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德根本不屑回答，也不打算请来客落座。不过小指头倒是大咧咧地主动坐了下来。“在你发完脾气后，就只剩下我来打消他们雇用无面者的念头。”他开心地续道，“还好收回了成命，只是让瓦里斯悄悄放出消息，谁做掉坦格利安家那女孩，我们就封谁当贵族。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3069');"><p>Ned was disgusted. "So now we grant titles to assassins."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3069" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德觉得恶心透顶。“所以我们要让刺客当贵族了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3070');"><p>Littlefinger shrugged. "Titles are cheap. The Faceless Men are expensive. If truth be told, I did the Targaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of honor. Let some sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill her. Likely he’ll make a botch of it, and afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard. If we’d sent a Faceless Man after her, she’d be as good as buried."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3070" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头耸耸肩。“反正封号挺便宜，无面者却花消不起。说实话，比起你满嘴仁义道德，我帮坦格利安家那女孩的忙是不是还要大些？就让哪个满脑子贵族梦的佣兵喝醉酒去杀杀看吧，八成会失手，往后多斯拉克人定会多加提防。假如我们派去的是无面者，那他们就只能收尸了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3071');"><p>Ned frowned. "You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses, and now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl? How big a fool do you take me for?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3071" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德皱眉。“我可没忘，你在会议上说到丑女和 ‘亲吻’，到现在你反过来指望我相信你是在想办法保护那女孩？你把我当大白痴了？”
