</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"><p>The grass-plot before the jail, in Prison Lane, on a certain summer morning, not less than two centuries ago, was occupied by a pretty large number of the inhabitants of Boston, all with their eyes intently fastened on the iron-clamped oaken door. Amongst any other population, or at a later period in the history of New England, the grim rigidity that petrified the bearded physiognomies of these good people would have augured some awful business in hand.  It could have betokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit, on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment.  But, in that early severity of the Puritan character, an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn.  It might be that a sluggish bond-servant, or an undutiful child, whom his parents had given over to the civil authority, was to be corrected at the whipping-post.  It might be that an Antinomian, a Quaker, or other heterodox religionist, was to be scourged out of the town, or an idle or vagrant Indian, whom the white man's firewater had made riotous about the streets, was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest.  It might be, too, that a witch, like old Mistress Hibbins, the bitter-tempered widow of the magistrate, was to die upon the gallows.  In either case, there was very much the same solemnity of demeanour on the part of the spectators, as befitted a people among whom religion and law were almost identical, and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused, that the mildest and severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful.  Meagre, indeed, and cold, was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for, from such bystanders, at the scaffold.  On the other hand, a penalty which, in our days, would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule, might then be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death itself.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"><p>It was a circumstance to be noted on the summer morning when our story begins its course, that the women, of whom there were several in the crowd, appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal infliction might be expected to ensue.  The age had not so much refinement, that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of petticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways, and wedging their not unsubstantial persons, if occasion were, into the throng nearest to the scaffold at an execution.  Morally, as well as materially, there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old English birth and breeding than in their fair descendants, separated from them by a series of six or seven generations; for, throughout that chain of ancestry, every successive mother had transmitted to her child a fainter bloom, a more delicate and briefer beauty, and a slighter physical frame, if not character of less force and solidity than her own.  The women who were now standing about the prison-door stood within less than half a century of the period when the man-like Elizabeth had been the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex. They were her countrywomen: and the beef and ale of their native land, with a moral diet not a whit more refined, entered largely into their composition.  The bright morning sun, therefore, shone on broad shoulders and well-developed busts, and on round and ruddy cheeks, that had ripened in the far-off island, and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of New England.  There was, moreover, a boldness and rotundity of speech among these matrons, as most of them seemed to be, that would startle us at the present day, whether in respect to its purport or its volume of tone. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在我们的故事发生的那个夏天的早晨，有一情况颇值一书：挤在人群中的好几位妇女，看来劝可能出现的任何刑罚那抱有特殊的兴趣。那年月没有那么多文明讲究，身着衬裙和撑裙的女人们公然出入于大庭广众之中，只要有可能，便要撅动姻们那并不娇弱的躯体，挤进最靠近刑台的人群中去，也不会缎入什么不成体统的感觉。那些在英伦故土上出生和成长的媳妇和姑娘们，比起她们六七代之后的漂亮的后裔来，身体要粗壮些，精神也要粗犷些；因为通过家系承袭的链条，每代母亲遗传给她女儿的，即使不是较她为少的坚实有力的性格，总会是比较柔弱的体质、更加娇小和短暂的美貌和更加纤细的身材。当时在牢门附近站着的妇女们，和那位堪称代表女性的男子气概的伊丽莎白①相距不足半个世纪。她们是那位女王的乡亲：她们家多的牛肉和麦酒，佐以未经提炼的精神食粮，大量充实进她们的躯体。因此，明亮的晨感所照射着的，是宽阔的肩膀、发育丰满的胸脯和又圆又红的双颊——她们都是在通远的祖国本岛上长大成人的，远还没有在新英格兰的气氛中变得白皙与瘦削些。尤其令人瞩目的是，这些主妇们多数人一开口便是粗喉咙、大嗓门，要是在今天，她们的言谈无论是含义还是音量，都足以使我们瞠目结舌。

It would be greatly for the public behoof if we women, being of mature age and church-members in good repute, should have the handling of such malefactresses as this Hester Prynne.  What think ye, gossips?  If the hussy stood up for judgment before us five, that are now here in a knot together, would she come off with such a sentence as the worshipful magistrates have awarded?  Marry, I trow not."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"><p>"The magistrates are God-fearing gentlemen, but merciful overmuch--that is a truth," added a third autumnal matron.  "At the very least, they should have put the brand of a hot iron on Hester Prynne's forehead.  Madame Hester would have winced at that, I warrant me.  But she--the naughty baggage--little will she care what they put upon the bodice of her gown!  Why, look you, she may cover it with a brooch, or such like heathenish adornment, and so walk the streets as brave as ever!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那帮宫老爷都是敬神的先生，可惜慈悲心太重陛——这可是真事，”第三个人老珠黄的婆娘补充说。“最起码，他们应该在海丝特白兰的脑门上烙个记号。那总能让海丝特太太有点怕，我敢这么说。可她——那个破烂货——她才不在乎他们在她前襟上贴个什么呢！哼，你们等着瞧吧，她准会别上个胸针，或者是异教徒的什么首饰，档住胸口，照样招摇过市！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"><p>"Ah, but," interposed, more softly, a young wife, holding a child by the hand, "let her cover the mark as she will, the pang of it will be always in her heart."

"This woman has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die; is there not law for it?  Truly there is, both in the Scripture and the statute-book.  Then let the magistrates, who have made it of no effect, thank themselves if their own wives and daughters go astray." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们扯什么记号不记号的，管它是在她前襟上还是脑门上呢？”另一个女人叫嚷着，她在这几个自命的法官中长相最丑，也最不留情。“这女人给我们大伙都丢了脸，她就该死。难道说没有管这种事的法律吗？明明有嘛，圣经里和法典上全都写着呢。那就请这些不照章办事的宫老爷们的太太小姐们去走邪路吧，那才叫自作自受呢！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"><p>"Mercy on us, goodwife!" exclaimed a man in the crowd, "is there no virtue in woman, save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows?  That is the hardest word yet!  Hush now, gossips for the lock is turning in the prison-door, and here comes Mistress Prynne herself." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“天哪，婆娘们，”人群中一个男人惊呼道，“女人看到绞刑架就害怕，除去这种廉耻之心，她们身上难道就没有德性了吗？别把话说得太重了！轻点，喂，婆娘们！牢门的锁在转呢，海丝特太太本人就要出来了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"><p>The door of the jail being flung open from within there appeared, in the first place, like a black shadow emerging into sunshine, the grim and gristly presence of the town-beadle, with a sword by his side, and his staff of office in his hand.  This personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the Puritanic code of law, which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender.  Stretching forth the official staff in his left hand, he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman, whom he thus drew forward, until, on the threshold of the prison-door, she repelled him, by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character, and stepped into the open air as if by her own free will.  She bore in her arms a child, a baby of some three months old, who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid light of day; because its existence, heretofore, had brought it acquaintance only with the grey twilight of a dungeon, or other darksome apartment of the prison. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>牢门从里面给一下子打开了，最先露面的是狱吏，他腰侧挎着剑，手中握着权杖，那副阴森可怖的模样象个暗影似的出现在日光之中。这个角色的尊容便是清教徒法典全部冷酷无情的象征和代表，对触犯法律购人最终和最直接执法则是他的差事。此时他伸出左手举着权杖，右手抓着一个年轻妇女的肩头，挽着她向前走；到了牢门口，她用了一个颇能说明她个性的力量和天生的尊严的动作，推开狱吏，象是出于她自主的意志一般走进露天地。她怀里抱着一个三个月左右的婴儿，那孩子眨着眼睛，转动她的小脸躲避着过分耀眼的阳光——自从她降生以来，还只习惯于监狱中的土牢或其它暗室那种昏晦的光线呢。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"><p>When the young woman--the mother of this child--stood fully revealed before the crowd, it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom; not so much by an impulse of motherly affection, as that she might thereby conceal a certain token, which was wrought or fastened into her dress.  In a moment, however, wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another, she took the baby on her arm, and with a burning blush, and yet a haughty smile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked around at her townspeople and neighbours.  On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore, and which was of a splendour in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当那年轻的妇女——就是婴儿的母亲——全身位立在人群面前时，她的第一个冲动似乎就是把孩子抱在胸前；她这么做与其说是出于母爱的激情，不如说可以借此掩盖钉在她衣裙上的标记。然而，她很快就醒悟过来了，用她的耻辱的一个标记来掩盖另一个标记是无济于事的，于是，索兴用一条胳膊架着孩子，她虽然面孔红得发烧，却露出高傲的微笑，用毫无愧色的目光环视着她的同镇居民和街坊邻里。她的裙袍的前胸上露出了一个用红色细布做就、周围用金丝线精心绣成奇巧花边的一个字母A。这个字母制作别致，体现了丰富面华美的匠心，佩在衣服上构成尽美尽善的装饰，而她的衣服把她那年月的情趣衬托得恰到好处，只是其艳丽程度大大超出了殖民地俭补标准的规定。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"><p>The young woman was tall, with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale.  She had dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam; and a face which, besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion, had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes.  She was ladylike, too, after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days; characterised by a certain state and dignity, rather than by the delicate, evanescent, and indescribable grace which is now recognised as its indication. And never had Hester Prynne appeared more ladylike, in the antique interpretation of the term, than as she issued from the prison.  Those who had before known her, and had expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud, were astonished, and even startled, to perceive how her beauty shone out, and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped.  It may be true that, to a sensitive observer, there was some thing exquisitely painful in it.  Her attire, which indeed, she had wrought for the occasion in prison, and had modelled much after her own fancy, seemed to express the attitude of her spirit, the desperate recklessness of her mood, by its wild and picturesque peculiarity.  But the point which drew all eyes, and, as it were, transfigured the wearer--so that both men and women who had been familiarly acquainted with Hester Prynne were now impressed as if they beheld her for the first time--was that SCARLET LETTER, so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom.  It had the effect of a spell, taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity, and enclosing her in a sphere by herself. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那年轻妇女身材颀长，体态优美之极。她头上乌黑的浓发光彩夺目，在阳光下说说熠熠生辉。她的面孔不仅皮肤滋润、五官端正、容貌秀丽，而且还有一对鲜明的眉毛和一双漆黑的深目，十分楚楚动人。就那个时代女性举止优雅的风范而论，她也属贵妇之列；她自有一种端庄的风韵，并不同子如今人们心目中的那种纤巧、轻盈和不可言喻的优雅。即使以当年的概念而吉，海丝特·白兰也从来没有象步出监狱的此时此刻这样更象贵妇。那些本来就认识她的人，原先满以为她经历过这一魔难，会缀然失色，结果却惊得都发呆了，因为他们所看到的，是她焕发的美丽，竟把笼罩着她的不幸和耻辱凝成一轮光环。不过，目光敏锐的旁观者无疑能从中觉察出一种微妙的痛楚。她在狱中按照自己的想象，专门为这场合制作的服饰，以其特有的任性和别致，似乎表达了她的精神境界和由绝望而无所顾忌的心情。但是，吸引了所有的人的目光而且事实上使海丝特白兰焕然一新的，则是在她胸前额频闪光的绣得妙不可言的那个红字，以致那些与她熟识的男男女女简直感到是第一次与她谋面。这个红字具有一种震慑的力量，竟然把她从普通的人间关系中超脱出来，紧裹在自身的氛围里。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"><p>"It were well," muttered the most iron-visaged of the old dames, "if we stripped Madame Hester's rich gown off her dainty shoulders; and as for the red letter which she hath stitched so curiously, I'll bestow a rag of mine own rheumatic flannel to make a fitter one!"

"Open a passage; and I promise ye, Mistress Prynne shall be set where man, woman, and child may have a fair sight of her brave apparel from this time till an hour past meridian.  A blessing on the righteous colony of the Massachusetts, where iniquity is dragged out into the sunshine!  Come along, Madame Hester, and show your scarlet letter in the market-place!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>狱吏此时用权杖做了个姿势。 “让开路，好心的人们，让开路，看在国王的份上！”他叫嚷着。“让开一条队我向诸位保证，白兰太太要站的地方，无论男女老少都可以看清她的漂亮的衣服，从现在起直到午后一点，保你们看个够。祝福光明正大的马萨诸塞殖民地，一切罪恶都得拉出来见见太阳！过来，海丝特太太，在这市场上亮亮你那鲜红的字母吧！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"><p>A lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators. Preceded by the beadle, and attended by an irregular procession of stern-browed men and unkindly visaged women, Hester Prynne set forth towards the place appointed for her punishment.  A crowd of eager and curious schoolboys, understanding little of the matter in hand, except that it gave them a half-holiday, ran before her progress, turning their heads continually to stare into her face and at the winking baby in her arms, and at the ignominious letter on her breast.  It was no great distance, in those days, from the prison door to the market-place.  Measured by the prisoner's experience, however, it might be reckoned a journey of some length; for haughty as her demeanour was, she perchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those that thronged to see her, as if her heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and trample upon.  In our nature, however, there is a provision, alike marvellous and merciful, that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it.  With almost a serene deportment, therefore, Hester Prynne passed through this portion of her ordeal, and came to a sort of scaffold, at the western extremity of the market-place.  It stood nearly beneath the eaves of Boston's earliest church, and appeared to be a fixture there. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>围观的人群中挤开了一条通路。海丝特白兰跟着在前面开路的狱吏，身后昆随着拧眉攒目购男人和心狠面恶的女人的不成形的队伍，走向指定让她示众的地方。一大群怀着好奇心来凑热闹的小男孩，对眼前的事态不明所以，只晓得学校放了他们半天假，他们一边在头前跑着，一边不时回过头来盯着她的脸、她怀中抱着的眨着眼的婴儿、还有她胸前那个丢人现眼的红字。当年，从牢门到市场没有几步路。然而，要是以囚犯的体验来测量，恐怕是一个路途迢迢的旅程；因为她虽说是高视阔步，但在人们逼视的目光下，每迈出一步都要经历一番痛苦，似乎她的心已经给抛到满心，任凭所有的人碾踩践踏。然而，在我们人类的本性中，原有一条既绝妙又慈悲的先天准备：遭受苦难的人在承受痛楚的当时并不能觉察到其剧烈的程度，反倒是过后延绵的折磨最能使其撕心裂肺。因此，海丝特白兰简直是以一种安详的举止，度过了此时的磨难，来到市场西端的刑台跟前。这座刑台几乎就竖在波士顿最早的教堂的檐下，看上去象是教堂的附属建筑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"><p>In fact, this scaffold constituted a portion of a penal machine, which now, for two or three generations past, has been merely historical and traditionary among us, but was held, in the old time, to be as effectual an agent, in the promotion of good citizenship, as ever was the guillotine among the terrorists of France.  It was, in short, the platform of the pillory; and above it rose the framework of that instrument of discipline, so fashioned as to confine the human head in its tight grasp, and thus hold it up to the public gaze.  The very ideal of ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this contrivance of wood and iron.  There can be no outrage, methinks, against our common nature--whatever be the delinquencies of the individual--no outrage more flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his face for shame; as it was the essence of this punishment to do. In Hester Prynne's instance, however, as not unfrequently in other cases, her sentence bore that she should stand a certain time upon the platform, but without undergoing that gripe about the neck and confinement of the head, the proneness to which was the most devilish characteristic of this ugly engine.  Knowing well her part, she ascended a flight of wooden steps, and was thus displayed to the surrounding multitude, at about the height of a man's shoulders above the street. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>事实上，这座刑台是构成整个惩罚机器的一个组成部分，时隔二、三代入的今天，它在我们的心目中只不过是一个历史和传统的纪念，但在当年，却如同法国大革命时期恐怖党人的断头台一样，被视为教化劝善的有效动力。简言之，这座刑台是一座枷号示众的台子，上面竖着那个惩罚用的套枷，做得刚好把人头紧紧卡使，以便引颈翘旨供人观赡。设计这样一个用铁和木制成的家伙显然极尽羞辱之能事。依我看来，无论犯有何等过失，再没有比这种暴行更违背我们的人性的了，其不准罪人隐藏他那羞惭的面容的险溺用心实在无以复加；而这侩洽是这一刑罚的本意所在。不过，就海丝特白兰的例子而论，例和多数其它案子相仿，她所受到的惩处是要在刑台上罚站示众一段时间，而无需受扼颈囚首之苦，从而幸免于这一丑陋的机器最为凶残的手段。她深知自己此时的角色的意义，举步登上一段木梯，站到齐肩高的台上，展示在围观人群的众目睽睽之前。

Here, there was the taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life, working such effect, that the world was only the darker for this woman's beauty, and the more lost for the infant that she had borne.

The witnesses of Hester Prynne's disgrace had not yet passed beyond their simplicity.  They were stern enough to look upon her death, had that been the sentence, without a murmur at its severity, but had none of the heartlessness of another social state, which would find only a theme for jest in an exhibition like the present.  Even had there been a disposition to turn the matter into ridicule, it must have been repressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less dignified than the governor, and several of his counsellors, a judge, a general, and the ministers of the town, all of whom sat or stood in a balcony of the meeting-house, looking down upon the platform.  When such personages could constitute a part of the spectacle, without risking the majesty, or reverence of rank and office, it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectual meaning.  Accordingly, the crowd was sombre and grave.  The unhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might, under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes, all fastened upon her, and concentrated at her bosom.  It was almost intolerable to be borne.  Of an impulsive and passionate nature, she had fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous stabs of public contumely, wreaking itself in every variety of insult; but there was a quality so much more terrible in the solemn mood of the popular mind, that she longed rather to behold all those rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment, and herself the object.  Had a roar of laughter burst from the multitude--each man, each woman, each little shrill-voiced child, contributing their individual parts--Hester Prynne might have repaid them all with a bitter and disdainful smile.  But, under the leaden infliction which it was her doom to endure, she felt, at moments, as if she must needs shriek out with the full power of her lungs, and cast herself from the scaffold down upon the ground, or else go mad at once.

Her mind, and especially her memory, was preternaturally active, and kept bringing up other scenes than this roughly hewn street of a little town, on the edge of the western wilderness: other faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the brims of those steeple-crowned hats.  Reminiscences, the most trifling and immaterial, passages of infancy and school-days, sports, childish quarrels, and the little domestic traits of her maiden years, came swarming back upon her, intermingled with recollections of whatever was gravest in her subsequent life; one picture precisely as vivid as another; as if all were of similar importance, or all alike a play.  Possibly, it was an instinctive device of her spirit to relieve itself by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms, from the cruel weight and hardness of the reality.

Standing on that miserable eminence, she saw again her native village, in Old England, and her paternal home: a decayed house of grey stone, with a poverty-stricken aspect, but retaining a half obliterated shield of arms over the portal, in token of antique gentility. She saw her father's face, with its bold brow, and reverend white beard that flowed over the old-fashioned Elizabethan ruff; her mother's, too, with the look of heedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance, and which, even since her death, had so often laid the impediment of a gentle remonstrance in her daughter's pathway.  She saw her own face, glowing with girlish beauty, and illuminating all the interior of the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it. There she beheld another countenance, of a man well stricken in years, a pale, thin, scholar-like visage, with eyes dim and bleared by the lamp-light that had served them to pore over many ponderous books.  Yet those same bleared optics had a strange, penetrating power, when it was their owner's purpose to read the human soul.  This figure of the study and the cloister, as Hester Prynne's womanly fancy failed not to recall, was slightly deformed, with the left shoulder a trifle higher than the right. Next rose before her in memory's picture-gallery, the intricate and narrow thoroughfares, the tall, grey houses, the huge cathedrals, and the public edifices, ancient in date and quaint in architecture, of a continental city; where new life had awaited her, still in connexion with the misshapen scholar: a new life, but feeding itself on time-worn materials, like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall.  Lastly, in lieu of these shifting scenes, came back the rude market-place of the Puritan, settlement, with all the townspeople assembled, and levelling their stern regards at Hester Prynne--yes, at herself--who stood on the scaffold of the pillory, an infant on her arm, and the letter A, in scarlet, fantastically embroidered with gold thread, upon her bosom.

She clutched the child so fiercely to her breast that it sent forth a cry; she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet letter, and even touched it with her finger, to assure herself that the infant and the shame were real.  Yes these were her realities--all else had vanished! 
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这一切会是真的吗？她把孩子往胸前猛地用力一抱，孩子昨地一声哭了；她垂下眼睛注视着那鲜红的字母，甚至还用指头触摸了一下，以便使自己确信婴儿和耻辱都是实实在在的。是啊——这些便是她的现实，其余的一切全都消失了！
