</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1160');"><p>THE council of buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them re-entered the house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which had in my eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment's loan of the torch. Silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us together in the dark. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1160" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那几个海盗商量了半天，其中一个才回到木屋来，再次向西尔弗敬了个礼（在我看来，略带点讽刺意味），想借火把暂用一下。西尔弗爽快地同意了，于是这个使者又出去，把我们留在漆黑的木屋中。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1161');"><p>"There's a breeze coming, Jim," said Silver, who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1161" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要刮风了，吉姆。”西尔弗说。这次，他对我已变得非常友好和亲见。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1162');"><p>I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch. About half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group; one held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight. The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though watching the manoeuvres of this last. I could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand, and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1162" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我走到最近的一个枪眼旁边向外看。一大堆火也烧得差不多了，烧剩下的灰反着又低又暗的光，我这才明白那些密谋者为什么要借火把。他们在木屋和栅栏之间的斜坡上聚成一堆：一个拿着火把，另一个跪在他们中间。我看见一把拔出的刀子在月光和火把下反射出五颜六色，其中几个像是俯身看着他在做什么；我只能看到他手里还拿着一本书。我正在纳闷他这会儿怎么会拿着这东西。这时，跪着的那个人已从地上重又站起来，于是他们全体一齐向木屋走来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1163');"><p>"Here they come," said I; and I returned to my former position, for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1163" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们过来了。”我说完又回到原来的位置上，好像让他们发觉我在偷看，将有损于我们的尊严。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1164');"><p>"Well, let 'em come, lad--let 'em come," said Silver cheerily. "I've still a shot in my locker." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1164" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“让他们来吧，孩子，让他们来吧，”西尔弗高兴地说，“我还留着一手对付他们呢。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1165');"><p>The door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together just inside, pushed one of their number forward. In any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance, hesitating as he set down each foot, but holding his closed right hand in front of him. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1165" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>门开了，五个人站在屋门口挤做一堆，把其中一个往前一推。他慢慢地走过来，每跨一步都要犹豫一下，向前伸出的右手握得紧紧的，要是在平时的任何场合，你看着一定会觉得可笑极了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1166');"><p>"Step up, lad," cried Silver. "I won't eat you. Hand it over, lubber. I know the rules, I do; I won't hurt a depytation." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1166" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“过来，伙计，”西尔弗喊道，“我不会吃了你的，把东西递给我，你这个傻大个儿。我懂得规矩，我不会难为一个使者。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1167');"><p>Thus encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly, and having passed something to Silver, from hand to hand, slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1167" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>经他这么一说，那个海盗胆子大了点。他加快脚步走上前来，把一件东西放在西尔弗手中，然后麻利地回到同伴的身边。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1168');"><p>The sea-cook looked at what had been given him. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1168" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>厨子看了看交给他的东西。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1169');"><p>"The black spot! I thought so," he observed. "Where might you have got the paper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; this ain't lucky! You've gone and cut this out of a Bible. What fool's cut a Bible?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1169" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“黑券！不出所料。”他说。“你们从哪儿弄来的纸？天哪，糟了，你们看看，这下完了！闯大祸了。你们是从《圣经》上撕下来的，是哪个混蛋干的？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1170');"><p>"Ah, there!" said Morgan. "There! Wot did I say? No good'll come o' that, I said." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1170" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“糟了！”摩根说，“糟了！我说过什么来着？这事准定没有好结果，让我说着了不是？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1171');"><p>"Well, you've about fixed it now, among you," continued Silver. "You'll all swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1171" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哼，这大概就是你们刚才商量决定的。”西尔弗继续说：“现在你们个个都不得好报。《圣经》是哪个王八羔子的？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1172');"><p>"It was Dick," said one. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1172" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“狄克的。”一个海盗说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1173');"><p>"Dick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers," said Silver. "He's seen his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1173" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“狄克，是你的吗？那就让狄克祷告吧。”西尔弗说，“狄克的好运这回算是到了头。你们瞧着我说的对不对。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1174');"><p>But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1174" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但这时那个黄眼珠的大个子插了嘴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1175');"><p>"Belay that talk, John Silver," he said. "This crew has tipped you the black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as in dooty bound, and see what's wrote there. Then you can talk." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1175" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“收起你那套唬人的鬼话，约翰西尔弗。”他说，“大伙一致决定按老规矩把黑券给你，你也按规矩把它翻过来看看上面写着什么，然后再说。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1176');"><p>"Thanky, George," replied the sea-cook. "You always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I'm pleased to see. Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'--that's it, is it? Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write, George? Why, you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew. You'll be cap'n next, I shouldn't wonder. Just oblige me with that torch again, will you? This pipe don't draw." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1176" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谢了，乔治，”厨子应道，“你一向办事干脆，而且我很高兴地看到，乔治，你把规矩牢记在心。好吧，不管怎么说，让我看看上面写的是什么？啊！‘下台’，是这么回事吗？字写得漂亮，跟铅印的一样，我敢保证，乔治，这不是你写的吗？你在这伙人中间的确是出类拔萃，你会当选下一届船长的，我不觉得奇怪。再将火把借我用一用，好吗？这烟斗吸起来不大通畅。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1177');"><p>"Come, now," said George, "you don't fool this crew no more. You're a funny man, by your account; but you're over now, and you'll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1177" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“行了，”乔治说，“你休想再骗人。你凭三寸不烂之舌尽装好人，可现在不顶用了。你还是从酒桶上跳下来，让我们投票选举。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1178');"><p>"I thought you said you knowed the rules," returned Silver contemptuously. "Leastways, if you don't, I do; and I wait here--and I'm still your cap'n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and I reply; in the meantime, your black spot ain't worth a biscuit. After that, we'll see." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1178" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我还以为你真懂规矩呢，”西尔弗轻蔑地回了几句，“你要是不懂的话，我教你。别忘了，眼前我还是你们的船长。我要在这里直等到你们提出对我不满意的理由来，我再给你们答复。眼下的黑券连口饭都不顶。这以后，咱们再走着瞧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1179');"><p>"Oh," replied George, "you don't be under no kind of apprehension; WE'RE all square, we are. First, you've made a hash of this cruise--you'll be a bold man to say no to that. Second, you let the enemy out o' this here trap for nothing. Why did they want out? I dunno, but it's pretty plain they wanted it. Third, you wouldn't let us go at them upon the march. Oh, we see through you, John Silver; you want to play booty, that's what's wrong with you. And then, fourth, there's this here boy." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1179" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哦，”乔治答道，“你尽管听着，我们都照实说。首先，这趟买卖都让你给弄砸了，要是你敢推卸责任，算是一条好汉。其次，你让敌人白白溜出了这个鬼地方，我不晓得他们为什么想离开，但显然他们是希望这样的。再其次，你不让我们追击。哦，我们算把你看透了，约翰西尔弗，你想脚踏两只船，这就是你的错处。还有最后一条，你竟偏向这小子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1180');"><p>"Is that all?" asked Silver quietly. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1180" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还有吗？”西尔弗沉着冷静地问道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1181');"><p>"Enough, too," retorted George. "We'll all swing and sun-dry for your bungling." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1181" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这些就足够了，”乔治反击道。“你这么不仁义，我们不会落得什么好下场，早晚得死在烈日下，被晒成鱼干。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1182');"><p>"Well now, look here, I'll answer these four p'ints; one after another I'll answer 'em. I made a hash o' this cruise, did I? Well now, you all know what I wanted, and you all know if that had been done that we'd 'a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was, every man of us alive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff, and the treasure in the hold of her, by thunder! Well, who crossed me? Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n? Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance? Ah, it's a fine dance--I'm with you there--and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a rope's end at Execution Dock by London town, it does. But who done it? Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George Merry! And you're the last above board of that same meddling crew; and you have the Davy Jones's insolence to up and stand for cap'n over me--you, that sank the lot of us! By the powers! But this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1182" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好吧，现在我来答复这四条，让我一条一条地解释。你说这趟买卖都坏在我身上，是不是？你们都晓得我想要干什么，你们也知道，如果一切顺利的话，今晚我们早就该回到伊斯班袅拉号船上，一个人也不会送死，稳稳当当的，而且我担保船舱里会装满了金银财宝！可是是谁碍了我们的事儿？是谁逼我下台，是你们选出来的合法船长吗？是谁在我们上岸的头一天就把黑券塞到我手里，弄这么个鬼把戏？啊，这把戏可真绝——也算上我一个。还真像伦敦城外正法码头上脖子上套着绳圈跳舞的水手玩的那套把戏。这到底是谁领的头？嗯，是安德森、汉兹还有你乔治墨利！在这帮惹是生非的家伙中间，你是最后一个喂鱼的。你这个坏事的家伙居然还不要脸想谋权篡位当船长。老天有眼！这简直比天方夜谭还荒唐。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1183');"><p>Silver paused, and I could see by the faces of George and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1183" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西尔弗停顿了一下，我从乔治及其同伙的表情上可以看出，西尔弗这番话没白说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1184');"><p>"That's for number one," cried the accused, wiping the sweat from his brow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house. "Why, I give you my word, I'm sick to speak to you. You've neither sense nor memory, and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea. Sea! Gentlemen o' fortune! I reckon tailors is your trade." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1184" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是第一条，”被指控的西尔弗喊将起来，抹去额头上的汗，大嗓门震得房子直响。“哼！告诉你们，我懒得跟你们说话。你们不明事理，还没记性，我真弄不懂你们的爹妈怎么会放心让你们到海上来做水手、碰运气！我看你们只配做个裁缝。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1185');"><p>"Go on, John," said Morgan. "Speak up to the others." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1185" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“往下说，约翰，”摩根说，“另外几条呢？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1186');"><p>"Ah, the others!" returned John. "They're a nice lot, ain't they? You say this cruise is bungled. Ah! By gum, if you could understand how bad it's bungled, you would see! We're that near the gibbet that my neck's stiff with thinking on it. You've seen 'em, maybe, hanged in chains, birds about 'em, seamen p'inting 'em out as they go down with the tide. 'Who's that?' says one. 'That! Why, that's John Silver. I knowed him well,' says another. And you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy. Now, that's about where we are, every mother's son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and other ruination fools of you. And if you want to know about number four, and that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn't he a hostage? Are we a-going to waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I shouldn't wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah, well, there's a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don't count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, John, with your head broke--or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you didn't know there was a consort coming either? But there is, and not so long till then; and we'll see who'll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that. And as for number two, and why I made a bargain--well, you came crawling on your knees to me to make it--on your knees you came, you was that downhearted--and you'd have starved too if I hadn't--but that's a trifle! You look there--that's why!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1186" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，另外几条！”约翰反驳道，“好像罪过不少，是不是？你们说这趟买卖跑砸了，天老爷啊，你们要是知道事情糟到什么地步的话，你们就会明白了！咱们上绞架的日子不远了，想起来脖子就发硬。你们也许见识过：戴着锁链的犯人绞死在半空中，大鸟绕着尸体飞。会有水手趁涨潮出海时指着问：‘那是谁？’有人会回答说：‘那个，当然喽，那是约翰西尔弗，我跟他熟得很。’这时你会听到尸体上的锁链被风吹得丁当响。直到船开到下一个浮标处还听得到。咱们都是爹娘的亲生骨肉，为什么要落到这样的下场呢？这都得感谢乔治墨利，感谢汉兹，感谢安德森和你们中另外一些干蠢事的傻瓜们。如果你们要我答复有关这个孩子的第四条，那就听我的！他难道不是一个很好的人质吗？为什么不利用他一下呢？不，这不是我们的做法。他也许是我们最后一线希望，我看很有可能。杀了那孩子？我不干，伙计们！还有第三条，是不是？嗯，这第三条还真有些谈头，也许你们还有良心没忘了一位真正大学毕业的大夫每天来看你们这件事吧。你，杰克，脑袋开了花；还有你，乔治墨利，不到六小时就跑肚一次，直到现在两眼还黄得跟桔子皮似的。难道你们忘了吗？也许你们没料到会有船来接他们吧？但确实有，用不了多久；到那时你们就会知道人质的用处。至于第二条，你们怪我为什么这么做，可明明是你们跪在地上爬到我跟前求我答应的。当时你们愁得要命，要不是我做了这笔交易，怕是你们早就饿死了！但这还是小事。你们往这儿看，这就是为什么！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1187');"><p>And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly recognized--none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three red crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captain's chest. Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I could fancy. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1187" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说着，他把一张纸扔在地板上，我立刻认出来那就是我在比尔彭斯箱子底里发现的用油布包着的泛黄的地图，上面有三个红色的叉叉。我实在想不出为什么大夫要把这张地图给他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1188');"><p>But if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers. They leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse. It went from hand to hand, one tearing it from another; and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination, you would have thought, not only they were fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it, besides, in safety. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1188" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但是，如果说这件事对我来说是无法解释的话，那么，剩下的那帮叛徒看到地图时的表情则更加难以置信。他们像一群猫发现一只耗子似地扑向那张纸，你抢我夺，扯来扯去，垂涎三尺地争着抢着看地图。听他们的叫骂声、呼喊声和孩子气的笑声，你也许以为他们不光是摸到了金银财宝，甚至已经安安全全地装在船上扬帆返航了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1189');"><p>"Yes," said one, "that's Flint, sure enough. J. F., and a score below, with a clove hitch to it; so he done ever." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1189" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，”其中一个说，“这的确是弗林特的图。这‘杰弗’两个字，还有下面的一道线和丁香结，正是他签名的花样。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1190');"><p>"Mighty pretty," said George. "But how are we to get away with it, and us no ship." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1190" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这当然好，”乔治说，“可我们没有船，怎么把财宝运走？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1191');"><p>Silver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with a hand against the wall: "Now I give you warning, George," he cried. "One more word of your sauce, and I'll call you down and fight you. How? Why, how do I know? You had ought to tell me that--you and the rest, that lost me my schooner, with your interference, burn you! But not you, you can't; you hain't got the invention of a cockroach. But civil you can speak, and shall, George Merry, you may lay to that." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1191" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西尔弗腾地跳起来，用一只手撑在墙上，喝斥道：“我警告你，乔治。你要是再啰嗦一句，我就跟你决斗。怎么运走？我哪里知道？你倒是应该说一说——你和另外那些蠢材，把我的船给丢掉了。一个个只会瞎嚷嚷！问你们也没用，你们蠢得还不如一只蟑螂。不过你说话定要讲点礼貌，乔治墨利，不要等我教你，你听见没有。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1192');"><p>"That's fair enow," said the old man Morgan. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1192" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这话有理。”老摩根说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1193');"><p>"Fair! I reckon so," said the sea-cook. "You lost the ship; I found the treasure. Who's the better man at that? And now I resign, by thunder! Elect whom you please to be your cap'n now; I'm done with it." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1193" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然有理，”厨子说，“你们丢了船。我找到了宝藏。究竟谁更有能力？现在我宣布辞职不干了！你们要选谁就选谁当船长。我是受够了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1194');"><p>"Silver!" they cried. "Barbecue forever! Barbecue for cap'n!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1194" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“西尔弗！”那些海盗齐声叫道，“我们永远跟‘大叉烧’走！‘大叉烧’永远当船长！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1195');"><p>"So that's the toon, is it?" cried the cook. "George, I reckon you'll have to wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as I'm not a revengeful man. But that was never my way. And now, shipmates, this black spot? 'Tain't much good now, is it? Dick's crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible, and that's about all." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1195" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯，这听起来还像句话！”厨子大声说，“乔治，我看你只好等下一轮了，朋友。也算你走运，我也不是个记仇的人，那可不是我的做法。那么，伙计们，这黑券怎么办？现在没用了吧？算狄克倒霉，糟蹋了他的《圣经》。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1196');"><p>"It'll do to kiss the book on still, won't it?" growled Dick, who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1196" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我以后是不是还可以吻着这本书宣誓？”狄克嘟着嘴问，他显然是为自己招来的祸端感到十分紧张。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1197');"><p>"A Bible with a bit cut out!" returned Silver derisively. "Not it. It don't bind no more'n a ballad-book." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1197" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“用撕掉了书页的《圣经》宣誓？”西尔弗觉得非常可笑，就回了一句。“那怎么行！这跟凭着歌本儿起誓一样不能算数。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1198');"><p>"Don't it, though?" cried Dick with a sort of joy. "Well, I reckon that's worth having too." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1198" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不算数？”狄克忽然高兴起来了，“那我还是要留着它。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1199');"><p>"Here, Jim--here's a cur'osity for you," said Silver, and he tossed me the paper. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1199" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“给你，吉姆，让你见识见识。”西尔弗说着，把一小片纸扔给我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1200');"><p>It was around about the size of a crown piece. One side was blank, for it had been the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of Revelation--these words among the rest, which struck sharply home upon my mind: "Without are dogs and murderers." The printed side had been blackened with wood ash, which already began to come off and soil my fingers; on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word "Depposed." I have that curiosity beside me at this moment, but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch, such as a man might make with his thumb-nail.

He himself slept peacefully and snored aloud, yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he was, to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him.
