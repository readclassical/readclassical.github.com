</p></origin><translate id="div_2434" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>#ch 第12章 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2435');"><p>Toward one in the morning, in the great bed of the Venice point draperies, Nana and the count lay still awake. He had returned to her that evening after a three days sulking fit. The room, which was dimly illumined by a lamp, seemed to slumber amid a warm, damp odor of love, while the furniture, with its white lacquer and silver incrustations, loomed vague and wan through the gloom. A curtain had been drawn to, so that the bed lay flooded with shadow. A sigh became audible; then a kiss broke the silence, and Nana, slipping off the coverlet, sat for a moment or two, barelegged, on the edge of the bed. The count let his head fall back on the pillow and remained in darkness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2435" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>快到深夜一点钟了，娜娜和伯爵躺在那张铺着威尼斯针织花边床单的大床上，还没有入睡。他怄了三天气，那天晚上回来了。卧室内只有一盏灯，灯光惨淡，充满睡意，弥漫着温暖、潮湿和作爱的气氛。镶银的白漆家具在灯光下泛着朦胧的白色。放下的帷幔把床湮没在一片黑暗之中。一声叹息，随后一个亲吻，打破了寂静的气氛，娜娜倏地从被窝里钻出来，光着腿在床沿上坐了片刻。伯爵的头落到枕头上，呆在黑暗中。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2436');"><p>"Dearest, you believe in the good God, don't you?" she queried after some moments' reflection. Her face was serious; she had been overcome by pious terrors on quitting her lover's arms.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2436" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“亲爱的，你信仰仁慈的上帝吗？”娜娜思索了一会儿才这样问道。她离开情人的怀里后，表情严肃，内心充满对宗教的恐惧。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2437');"><p>Since morning, indeed, she had been complaining of feeling uncomfortable, and all her stupid notions, as she phrased it, notions about death and hell, were secretly torturing her. From time to time she had nights such as these, during which childish fears and atrocious fancies would thrill her with waking nightmares. She continued:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2437" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从早上起，她就抱怨自己身体不适。正如她所说，她的一些愚蠢的想法，如对死亡和地狱的想法，在暗暗地折磨着她。有时，她在夜里像孩子一样害怕起来，头脑中产生一些可怕的想法，把她折磨得睁着眼睛做噩梦。她又说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2438');"><p>"I say, d'you think I shall go to heaven?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2438" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么样？你想不到我要上天堂了吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2439');"><p>And with that she shivered, while the count, in his surprise at her putting such singular questions at such a moment, felt his old religious remorse returning upon him. Then with her chemise slipping from her shoulders and her hair unpinned, she again threw herself upon his breast, sobbing and clinging to him as she did so.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2439" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，她打了一个战栗。伯爵感到蹊跷，在这样的时刻她竟然提出这些怪问题来，他觉得自己心中又萌发了天主教徒的悔恨。这时，睡衣从她的肩上落下来，头发披散着，猛然扑到伯爵的怀里，紧紧搂住他，呜咽起来： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2440');"><p>"I'm afraid of dying! I'm afraid of dying!" He had all the trouble in the world to disengage himself. Indeed, he was himself afraid of giving in to the sudden madness of this woman clinging to his body in her dread of the Invisible. Such dread is contagious, and he reasoned with her. Her conduct was perfect—she had only to conduct herself well in order one day to merit pardon. But she shook her head. Doubtless she was doing no one any harm; nay, she was even in the constant habit of wearing a medal of the Virgin, which she showed to him as it hung by a red thread between her breasts. Only it had been foreordained that all unmarried women who held conversation with men would go to hell. Scraps of her catechism recurred to her remembrance. Ah, if one only knew for certain, but, alas, one was sure of nothing; nobody ever brought back any information, and then, truly, it would be stupid to bother oneself about things if the priests were talking foolishness all the time. Nevertheless, she religiously kissed her medal, which was still warm from contact with her skin, as though by way of charm against death, the idea of which filled her with icy horror. Muffat was obliged to accompany her into the dressing room, for she shook at the idea of being alone there for one moment, even though she had left the door open. When he had lain down again she still roamed about the room, visiting its several corners and starting and shivering at the slightest noise. A mirror stopped her, and as of old she lapsed into obvious contemplation of her nakedness. But the sight of her breast, her waist and her thighs only doubled her terror, and she ended by feeling with both hands very slowly over the bones of her face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2440" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我怕死……我怕死……” 他使出全身力气才挣脱了她。这个女人因为怕死，紧紧地抱住他，这种恐惧感是有传染性的，他生怕自己的情绪也受到她的精神错乱的影响，便劝导她。他说她身体很好，只要她行为规矩一些，总有一天，她会得到上帝宽恕的。但是她摇摇头，她不曾伤害过任何人，这是不容置疑的。她胸前总是戴着圣母像，她还把一根红线系在两乳之间的圣母像指给他看；不过，上帝是安排好了的，凡是没有结过婚同男人同居的女人都要入地狱。她想起了教理书中的零零星星的东西。啊！人要能知道死后怎样，那该多好，但是什么也不知道，没有一个人带回来死后的消息。确实，如果神甫们说的是蠢话，我们去烦这烦那，真是傻瓜。不过，她仍然虔诚地吻那个带着她体温的圣像，她把那个圣像看成可以驱除死亡的祛邪物，她一想到死就怕得浑身发冷。 她到梳洗间去也要缪法陪同，即使开着门，她在那里呆一会儿，也怕得浑身发抖。缪法又躺到床上，她还在卧室里踱来踱去，每个角落她都要看看，那怕听见一点点声音，便吓得浑身打哆嗦。她在一面镜子前面停下来，像从前一样，她一看见自己的裸体，就忘掉了一切。但是这一次，她看见自己的胸脯、腰部和大腿，更加害怕起来，最后她抬起双手摸着脸上的骨头，摸了好一阵子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2441');"><p>"You're ugly when you're dead," she said in deliberate tones.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2441" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“人死后样子就难看了。”她拖长声音说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2442');"><p>And she pressed her cheeks, enlarging her eyes and pushing down her jaw, in order to see how she would look. Thus disfigured, she turned toward the count.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2442" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她用手挤压双颊，睁大眼睛，下颌向内收缩，想看看自己死后是什么样子。接着，她把这副鬼脸转向伯爵，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2443');"><p>"Do look! My head'll be quite small, it will!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2443" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你瞧，我死后脑袋会变得很小。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2444');"><p>At this he grew vexed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2444" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵见她那样子，生气了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2445');"><p>"You're mad; come to bed!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2445" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你疯了，快点睡觉吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2446');"><p>He fancied he saw her in a grave, emaciated by a century of sleep, and he joined his hands and stammered a prayer. It was some time ago that the religious sense had reconquered him, and now his daily access of faith had again assumed the apoplectic intensity which was wont to leave him well-nigh stunned. The joints of his fingers used to crack, and he would repeat without cease these words only: "My God, my God, my God!" It was the cry of his impotence, the cry of that sin against which, though his damnation was certain, he felt powerless to strive. When Nana returned she found him hidden beneath the bedclothes; he was haggard; he had dug his nails into his bosom, and his eyes stared upward as though in search of heaven. And with that she started to weep again. Then they both embraced, and their teeth chattered they knew not why, as the same imbecile obsession over-mastered them. They had already passed a similar night, but on this occasion the thing was utterly idiotic, as Nana declared when she ceased to be frightened. She suspected something, and this caused her to question the count in a prudent sort of way. It might be that Rose Mignon had sent the famous letter! But that was not the case; it was sheer fright, nothing more, for he was still ignorant whether he was a cuckold or no.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2446" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他仿佛看见她躺在坟墓里，长眠了一个世纪，只剩下一身白骨。于是他双手合十，口中念念有词，祈祷起来。已有一段时间，宗教信仰又征服了他，每天这种信仰发作起来，就像中风一样来势凶猛，把他弄得疲惫不堪。他的手指格格作响，口中不停地念着：“我的天主……我的天主……我的天主……”这是他的软弱无力的叫喊，是他的罪孽的叫喊。尽管他知道自己肯定要下地狱，但他却无力洗刷自己的罪孽。娜娜回到床上时，她发现他盖着被子，神色惶恐不安，指甲放在胸口，眼睛仰望着空中，似乎在寻找天国。娜娜又哭了，两人搂抱起来，牙齿咬得格格响，他俩自己也莫名其妙，只能在愚蠢的顽念中打滚。以前他们已经度过类似这样的一个夜晚；不过，这一次太荒唐了，娜娜不再害怕后，自己也这么说。她突然起了疑心，便谨慎地问伯爵：罗丝米尼翁大概已经把那封告发信寄出去了。但是事情并不是这样，不过是伯爵害怕而已，没有别的，因为他还不知道自己戴了绿帽子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2447');"><p>Two days later, after a fresh disappearance, Muffat presented himself in the morning, a time of day at which he never came. He was livid; his eyes were red and his whole man still shaken by a great internal struggle. But Zoe, being scared herself, did not notice his troubled state. She had run to meet him and now began crying:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2447" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>缪法又一次离开娜娜出走，两天没回来，一天早上，他突然来了；他从来不在这样的时刻回来。他脸色铁青，两眼通红，心绪不宁，内心还在激烈斗争着。可是心里慌张的佐爱没有发觉他忐忑不安的神态，便跑过来迎接他，对他说道：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2448');"><p>"Oh, monsieur, do come in! Madame nearly died yesterday evening!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2448" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！先生，您终于回来了！昨天晚上，太太差点死了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2449');"><p>And when he asked for particulars:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2449" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵问她详细情况，她回答道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2450');"><p>"Something it's impossible to believe has happened—a miscarriage, monsieur."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2450" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这事说了别人难以相信……太太小产了，先生！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2451');"><p>Nana had been in the family way for the past three months. For long she had simply thought herself out of sorts, and Dr Boutarel had himself been in doubt. But when afterward he made her a decisive announcement, she felt so bored thereby that she did all she possibly could to disguise her condition. Her nervous terrors, her dark humors, sprang to some extent from this unfortunate state of things, the secret of which she kept very shamefacedly, as became a courtesan mother who is obliged to conceal her plight. The thing struck her as a ridiculous accident, which made her appear small in her own eyes and would, had it been known, have led people to chaff her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2451" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜怀孕已经三个月了。很长时间以来，她以为自己只是身体不适，但布塔雷医生却有点怀疑，后来他明确说她怀了孕。因为她觉得很烦恼，就竭尽全力隐瞒怀孕真相。她神经质般地恐惧，心情忧郁，与这件事多少有点关系。她对怀孕之事守口如瓶，为没有结婚就怀了孕而感到很害羞，不得不把真相隐瞒起来。对她来说，这似乎是一件意外事故，人家知道了会有损她的声誉，人家会取笑她。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2452');"><p>"A poor joke, eh?" she said. "Bad luck, too, certainly."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2452" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哎？真是开玩笑！真倒霉！
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2453');"><p>She was necessarily very sharp set when she thought her last hour had come. There was no end to her surprise, too; her sexual economy seemed to her to have got out of order; it produced children then even when one did not want them and when one employed it for quite other purposes! Nature drove her to exasperation; this appearance of serious motherhood in a career of pleasure, this gift of life amid all the deaths she was spreading around, exasperated her. Why could one not dispose of oneself as fancy dictated, without all this fuss? And whence had this brat come? She could not even suggest a father. Ah, dear heaven, the man who made him would have a splendid notion had he kept him in his own hands, for nobody asked for him; he was in everybody's way, and he would certainly not have much happiness in life!
</p></origin><translate id="div_2453" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她以为自己不会再怀孕了，这次偏偏又碰上了。她惊讶不已，仿佛她的性器官的功能紊乱了，她不想要孩子，并把这东西作了别的用途时，她偏偏怀了孕。造化令她恼怒，在她正当享乐的时候，竟然要让她当上严肃的母亲，在她把周围的男人一个个害死的时候，竟然给她一个小生命。难道人不该少遇到一些麻烦，按照自己的意愿来安排生活吗？这个小孩是从哪里掉下来的呢？连她自己也说不清楚。啊！天哪！这个孩子的父亲要有好心肠才会承认孩子是自己的，因为现在还没有一个人承认，如果一个人专门损害别人，他自己一生中肯定不会很幸福的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2454');"><p>Meanwhile Zoe described the catastrophe.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2454" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，佐爱把这件倒霉的事的经过讲给伯爵听。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2455');"><p>"Madame was seized with colic toward four o'clock. When she didn't come back out of the dressing room I went in and found her lying stretched on the floor in a faint. Yes, monsieur, on the floor in a pool of blood, as though she had been murdered. Then I understood, you see. I was furious; Madame might quite well have confided her trouble to me. As it happened, Monsieur Georges was there, and he helped me to lift her up, and directly a miscarriage was mentioned he felt ill in his turn! Oh, it's true I've had the hump since yesterday!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2455" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“将近四点钟时，太太肚子疼起来。我见她到梳妆室去很久不出来，就进去看看，发现她躺在地上，晕了过去。是的，先生，她晕倒在地上，还有一摊血，像被人谋杀了似的……于是，我明白了是怎么回事。我很生气，太太应该把这事告诉我……当时恰巧乔治先生也在场。他帮我把她扶起来，他一听到小产这个词，也难过了……说真的，从昨天起，我就为太太发愁！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2456');"><p>In fact, the house seemed utterly upset. All the servants were galloping upstairs, downstairs and through the rooms. Georges had passed the night on an armchair in the drawing room. It was he who had announced the news to Madame's friends at that hour of the evening when Madame was in the habit of receiving. He had still been very pale, and he had told his story very feelingly, and as though stupefied. Steiner, La Faloise, Philippe and others, besides, had presented themselves, and at the end of the lad's first phrase they burst into exclamations. The thing was impossible! It must be a farce! After which they grew serious and gazed with an embarrassed expression at her bedroom door. They shook their heads; it was no laughing matter.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2456" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>公馆里确实乱糟糟的，仆人们跑上跑下，每个房间里都有仆人进进出出。乔治在客厅的一张椅子上过了一夜。晚上，在太太平常接待客人的时间，乔治把这个消息告诉了太太的朋友们。他面色苍白，带着惊愕和激动的神态，讲述事情发生的经过。斯泰内、拉法卢瓦兹、菲利普和其他人已经来过了。他们听到第一句话，就大叫一声，这不可能！一定是在开玩笑！接着，他们变得严肃起来，目光盯着房门，神态惆怅，摇摇头，不再觉得这是可笑的了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2457');"><p>Till midnight a dozen gentlemen had stood talking in low voices in front of the fireplace. All were friends; all were deeply exercised by the same idea of paternity. They seemed to be mutually excusing themselves, and they looked as confused as if they had done something clumsy. Eventually, however, they put a bold face on the matter. It had nothing to do with them: the fault was hers! What a stunner that Nana was, eh? One would never have believed her capable of such a fake! And with that they departed one by one, walking on tiptoe, as though in a chamber of death where you cannot laugh.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2457" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>共有十二位先生坐在壁炉前，他们低声聊天，一直聊到午夜为止。他们都是朋友，每个人都在苦苦思索，究竟谁是父亲。他们好像彼此原谅，个个惴惴不安，觉得自己做了蠢事。然后，他们弓起背，觉得这事与他们毫不相干，这是娜娜自己的事。哎！这个娜娜真了不起！人家从来没有想到她会闹出这样的笑话！随后他们一个接一个蹑手蹑脚地走了，似乎这间卧室里死了人，不能笑出声来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2458');"><p>"Come up all the same, monsieur," said Zoe to Muffat. "Madame is much better and will see you. We are expecting the doctor, who promised to come back this morning."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2458" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“先生，还是上楼去吧，”佐爱对缪法说道，“太太身体好多了，她会接待你的……我们在等大夫来，他答应今天早上来看太太。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2459');"><p>The lady's maid had persuaded Georges to go back home to sleep, and upstairs in the drawing room only Satin remained. She lay stretched on a divan, smoking a cigarette and scanning the ceiling. Amid the household scare which had followed the accident she had been white with rage, had shrugged her shoulders violently and had made ferocious remarks. Accordingly, when Zoe was passing in front of her and telling Monsieur that poor, dear Madame had suffered a great deal:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2459" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这个贴身女仆劝说乔治回家睡觉了。楼上客厅里只剩下萨丹一个人，她躺在一张长沙发上，嘴里叼支香烟，眼睛望着上空。娜娜意外小产后，公馆里的人个个惊慌失措，她却无动于衷，肚子里憋着气，不时耸耸肩膀，说几句刻薄话。佐爱走过她面前时，跟伯爵说，可怜的太太这次可吃了大苦头。萨丹脱口说了一句难听的话： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2460');"><p>"That's right; it'll teach him!" said Satin curtly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2460" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这才好呢，这次可教训了她一下！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2461');"><p>They turned round in surprise, but she had not moved a muscle; her eyes were still turned toward the ceiling, and her cigarette was still wedged tightly between her lips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2461" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他俩吃惊地掉过头来。萨丹一动也没有动，眸子一直盯住天花板，两片嘴唇死命地叼着那支香烟。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2462');"><p>"Dear me, you're charming, you are!" said Zoe.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2462" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎！你的心肠真好！”佐爱说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2463');"><p>But Satin sat up, looked savagely at the count and once more hurled her remark at him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2463" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>萨丹坐起来，气乎乎地瞧着伯爵，对准他的面孔又说了一遍： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2464');"><p>"That's right; it'll teach him!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2464" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这才好呢，这次可教训了她一下！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2465');"><p>And she lay down again and blew forth a thin jet of smoke, as though she had no interest in present events and were resolved not to meddle in any of them. No, it was all too silly!
</p></origin><translate id="div_2465" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，她又躺下来，吐出淡淡的一缕烟，仿佛事不关己并决心不介入这事。不管啦，真是太愚蠢了！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2466');"><p>Zoe, however, introduced Muffat into the bedroom, where a scent of ether lingered amid warm, heavy silence, scarce broken by the dull roll of occasional carriages in the Avenue de Villiers. Nana, looking very white on her pillow, was lying awake with wide-open, meditative eyes. She smiled when she saw the count but did not move.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2466" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佐爱还是领缪法进了卧室。屋里温暖而又宁静，散发着一股乙醚的气味，维里埃大街上偶尔有马车驶过，车轮发出低沉的声音，有点打破室内的寂静。娜娜的头枕在枕头上，面色苍白，还没有入睡，眼睛睁得大大的，像在沉思冥想。她看见伯爵，一动没动，只嫣然一笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2467');"><p>"Ah, dear pet!" she slowly murmured. "I really thought I should never see you again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2467" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！我的心肝，”她拖长声音悄声说道，“我原来以为永远见不到你了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2468');"><p>Then as he leaned forward to kiss her on the hair, she grew tender toward him and spoke frankly about the child, as though he were its father.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2468" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他俯下身子去吻她的头发，她感动了，真心诚意地对他谈到孩子，似乎伯爵就是孩子的父亲。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2469');"><p>"I never dared tell you; I felt so happy about it! Oh, I used to dream about it; I should have liked to be worthy of you! And now there's nothing left. Ah well, perhaps that's best. I don't want to bring a stumbling block into your life."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2469" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我一直不敢告诉你……我感到很幸福！我做过不少梦，我真希望他不愧是你的孩子，现在一切都完了……不过，这样也许更好些。我不想给你生活中添麻烦。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2470');"><p>Astounded by this story of paternity, he began stammering vague phrases. He had taken a chair and had sat down by the bed, leaning one arm on the coverlet. Then the young woman noticed his wild expression, the blood reddening his eyes, the fever that set his lips aquiver.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2470" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他听说自己是孩子的父亲，感到很惊讶，结结巴巴说了几句话。他搬了一把椅子，坐到床边，把一只胳膊搁在被子上。这时候，娜娜发现他大惊失色，眼睛通红，嘴唇像发烧似的颤抖着。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2471');"><p>"What's the matter then?" she asked. "You're ill too."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2471" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你怎么啦？”她问道，“难道你也病啦？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2472');"><p>"No," he answered with extreme difficulty.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2472" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有。”他不无痛苦地说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2473');"><p>She gazed at him with a profound expression. Then she signed to Zoe to retire, for the latter was lingering round arranging the medicine bottles. And when they were alone she drew him down to her and again asked:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2473" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她用深情的目光瞧瞧他。接着她做了一个手势，把呆在那里收拾药瓶的佐爱打发走。等房间里只有他们两个人时，她把他拉到身边，问道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2474');"><p>"What's the matter with you, darling? The tears are ready to burst from your eyes—I can see that quite well. Well now, speak out; you've come to tell me something."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2474" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你怎么啦，亲爱的？……你眼泪汪汪，我看得很清楚…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2475');"><p>"No, no, I swear I haven't," he blurted out. But he was choking with suffering, and this sickroom, into which he had suddenly entered unawares, so worked on his feelings that he burst out sobbing and buried his face in the bedclothes to smother the violence of his grief. Nana understood. Rose Mignon had most assuredly decided to send the letter. She let him weep for some moments, and he was shaken by convulsions so fierce that the bed trembled under her. At length in accents of motherly compassion she queried:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2475" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说出来吧，你来肯定有什么事情要对我说。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2476');"><p>"You've had bothers at your home?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2476" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有事情，没有事情，我向你保证。”他结结巴巴说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2477');"><p>He nodded affirmatively. She paused anew, and then very low:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2477" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可是他痛苦得喉咙哽住了，不知道自己为什么进了病人的房间，进来了非常伤感，抽抽噎噎哭了，他把脸埋到被子里，试图不让痛苦迸发出来。娜娜这下明白了，一定是罗丝米尼翁下了狠心，把那封信寄走了。娜娜让他哭了一会儿。他哭得身子猛烈抽搐着，连她躺着的床都被震动了。末了，她用慈母般的同情口吻问道：

The night before, on his return from a party given by the empress, he had received the letter Sabine had written her lover. After an atrocious night passed in the meditation of vengeance he had gone out in the morning in order to resist a longing which prompted him to kill his wife. Outside, under a sudden, sweet influence of a fine June morning, he had lost the thread of his thoughts and had come to Nana's, as he always came at terrible moments in his life. There only he gave way to his misery, for he felt a cowardly joy at the thought that she would console him.

In fact, you wanted proofs. The deuce, you've got one today, and I know it's hard lines. Nevertheless, you must look at the matter quietly: you're not dishonored because it's happened."

Everything would have come out—her fiasco at the Varietes, her house, her manner of life. Oh dear, no! She had no wish for all that amount of advertising. Some dirty women might, perhaps, have driven him to it for the sake of getting a thundering big advertisement, but she—she desired his happiness before all else. She had drawn him down toward her and, after passing her arm around his neck, was nursing his head close to hers on the edge of the pillow. And with that she whispered softly:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2505');"><p>And she continued in this strain, giving him the most excellent advice. She even spoke of God, and the count thought he was listening to M. Venot, when that old gentleman endeavored to sermonize him out of the grasp of sin. Nana, however, did not speak of breaking it off entirely: she preached indulgent good nature and suggested that, as became a dear, nice old fellow, he should divide his attentions between his wife and his mistress, so that they would all enjoy a quiet life, devoid of any kind of annoyance, something, in fact, in the nature of a happy slumber amid the inevitable miseries of existence. Their life would be nowise changed: he would still be the little man of her heart. Only he would come to her a bit less often and would give the countess the nights not passed with her. She had got to the end of her strength and left off, speaking under her breath:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2505" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她仍然这样说下去，以良言相劝。她甚至谈到了天主。他以为是在听韦诺先生讲话，老头子在训诫他，要把他从罪孽中拯救出来时，就是这样说话的。不过，她并没有谈到与他绝断关系，而是劝他两边逢迎，在老婆和情妇之间做一个老好人，让她们两人各得其所，这样平平静静地过日子，使每个人都没有烦恼，就像在人生不可避免的烦恼中，能够有幸福的睡眠一样。这对他俩的生活毫无影响，他依然是她的心肝宝贝，只不过他来的次数略少一些，他不同她过夜时，就同伯爵夫人一起过夜。她已经精疲力竭了，轻轻舒了口气，最后说道：

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2507');"><p>Silence reigned. She had closed her eyes and lay wan upon her pillow. The count was patiently listening to her, not wishing her to tire herself. A whole minute went by before she reopened her eyes and murmured:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2508');"><p>"Besides, how about the money? Where would you get the money from if you must grow angry and go to law? Labordette came for the bill yesterday. As for me, I'm out of everything; I have nothing to put on now."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2508" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“再说钱吧，怎么办？如果你发起火来，到哪里去弄钱呢？……昨天拉博德特还来催讨那张本票的钱……我呀，什么也没有，连身上穿的衣服也没有了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2509');"><p>Then she shut her eyes again and looked like one dead. A shadow of deep anguish had passed over Muffat's brow. Under the present stroke he had since yesterday forgotten the money troubles from which he knew not how to escape. Despite formal promises to the contrary, the bill for a hundred thousand francs had been put in circulation after being once renewed, and Labordette, pretending to be very miserable about it, threw all the blame on Francis, declaring that he would never again mix himself up in such a matter with an uneducated man. It was necessary to pay, for the count would never have allowed his signature to be protested. Then in addition to Nana's novel demands, his home expenses were extraordinarily confused. On their return from Les Fondettes the countess had suddenly manifested a taste for luxury, a longing for worldly pleasures, which was devouring their fortune. Her ruinous caprices began to be talked about. Their whole household management was altered, and five hundred thousand francs were squandered in utterly transforming the old house in the Rue Miromesnil. Then there were extravagantly magnificent gowns and large sums disappeared, squandered or perhaps given away, without her ever dreaming of accounting for them. Twice Muffat ventured to mention this, for he was anxious to know how the money went, but on these occasions she had smiled and gazed at him with so singular an expression that he dared not interrogate her further for fear of a too-unmistakable answer. If he were taking Daguenet as son-in-law as a gift from Nana it was chiefly with the hope of being able to reduce Estelle's dower to two hundred thousand francs and of then being free to make any arrangements he chose about the remainder with a young man who was still rejoicing in this unexpected match.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2509" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然后，她又闭上眼睛，像死人一样。缪法的脸上掠过一抹愁云。昨天晚上他受了打击，他把不知怎样摆脱的手头拮据一事忘得一干二净。那张十万法郎的期票，延期过一次，尽管持票人明确答应不转手，还是拿到市场上流通了。拉博德特装得毫无办法，把责任全推给弗朗西斯，说他以后再也不跟没有教养的人打交道了。这笔钱一定要付，伯爵绝不能拒绝支付自己签过字的票据。此外，除了娜娜提出的各种新的要求以外，伯爵家里的花费也很铺张。伯爵夫人从丰岱特回来后，突然变得奢侈起来，产生了上流社会享受的欲望，这种欲望在吞噬着他们的财产。人们在谈论她任性挥霍钱财，公馆里变得焕然一新，花了五十万法郎修缮米罗梅斯尼尔街的那座旧公馆，服装花费极其昂贵，大笔大笔钱不见了，溶化了，也可能送人了，伯爵夫人想不到说一下钱的去向。有两次，伯爵鼓足勇气提出钱的问题，想知道花在何处，可是伯爵夫人微微一笑，用古怪的神情瞅着他，他吓得不敢再问了，担心她回答得太明确了。他所以从娜娜手中接过达盖内作为女婿，是考虑到能把爱斯泰勒的嫁妆减少到二十万法郎，而其它一切筹办均由年轻人负责，自己毋庸操心，这门出乎意料的亲事，他还是挺高兴的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2510');"><p>Nevertheless, for the last week, under the immediate necessity of finding Labordette's hundred thousand francs, Muffat had been able to hit on but one expedient, from which he recoiled. This was that he should sell the Bordes, a magnificent property valued at half a million, which an uncle had recently left the countess. However, her signature was necessary, and she herself, according to the terms of the deed, could not alienate the property without the count's authorization. The day before he had indeed resolved to talk to his wife about this signature. And now everything was ruined; at such a moment he would never accept of such a compromise. This reflection added bitterness to the frightful disgrace of the adultery. He fully understood what Nana was asking for, since in that ever-growing self-abandonment which prompted him to put her in possession of all his secrets, he had complained to her of his position and had confided to her the tiresome difficulty he was in with regard to the signature of the countess.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2510" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而，一个星期以来，缪法为了立即筹足十万法郎来应付拉博德特，他想到只有一个办法，这个办法使他退缩了。那就是卖掉博尔德的住宅，这是一座华丽的住宅，估计值五十万法郎，是伯爵夫人的一个伯父不久前遗赠给她的。不过，遗嘱规定，出卖住宅必须要有她的签字，没有征得伯爵的同意，她也不能转让住宅。昨天晚上，他终于下了决心，想同妻子商谈签字的事，现在一切都完了。在这样的时刻，他决不会接受这样的和解。想到这里，妻子偷汉的事给了他更加可怕的打击。他完全理解娜娜的目的，因为他对她越来越推心置腹，这就使他不管有什么事情都要与她商量，他向她埋怨过自己的处境，他要求伯爵夫人签字的事，他也向她吐露过。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2511');"><p>Nana, however, did not seem to insist. She did not open her eyes again, and, seeing her so pale, he grew frightened and made her inhale a little ether. She gave a sigh and without mentioning Daguenet asked him some questions.

And the revolt within him ceased, for this warm and slumberous sickroom, with its all-pervading scent of ether, had ended by lulling him into a mere longing for happiness and peace. All his manhood, erewhile maddened by wrong, had departed out of him in the neighborhood of that warm bed and that suffering woman, whom he was nursing under the influence of her feverish heat and of remembered delights. He leaned over her and pressed her in a close embrace, while despite her unmoved features her lips wore a delicate, victorious smile. But Dr Boutarel made his appearance.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2516" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他抓住她的一只手，让她平静下来。是的，走着瞧吧，但是要紧的还是她要好好休息。他不再生气了。这间充满乙醚味的病人卧室是如此温暖，如此宁静，终于使他息怒了，他正需要安静，心情舒畅一下。在这张温暖的床边，坐在他照料着的这个痛苦的女人的身边，她那热忱的激励，唤起了他对往日的肉欲快乐的回忆，他那受到侮辱后大发雷霆的男子汉脾气，渐渐烟消云散了。他向她俯下身子，紧紧搂住她，娜娜脸上却毫无表情，只是嘴角上挂着一丝胜利的微笑。这时候布塔雷大夫来了。

He had a superb practice among the gay world, and being very merry by nature and ready to laugh and joke in the friendliest way with the demimonde ladies with whom, however, he never went farther, he charged very high fees and got them paid with the greatest punctuality. Moreover, he would put himself out to visit them on the most trivial occasions, and Nana, who was always trembling at the fear of death, would send and fetch him two or three times a week and would anxiously confide to him little infantile ills which he would cure to an accompaniment of amusing gossip and harebrained anecdotes.

Owing to the warmth of the June nights, it had become possible to open the two doors of the great drawing room and to extend the dancing floor to the sanded paths of the garden. When the first guests arrived and were welcomed at the door by the count and the countess they were positively dazzled. One had only to recall to mind the drawing room of the past, through which flitted the icy, ghostly presence of the Countess Muffat, that antique room full of an atmosphere of religious austerity with its massive First Empire mahogany furniture, its yellow velvet hangings, its moldy ceiling through which the damp had soaked. Now from the very threshold of the entrance hall mosaics set off with gold were glittering under the lights of lofty candelabras, while the marble staircase unfurled, as it were, a delicately chiseled balustrade. Then, too, the drawing room looked splendid; it was hung with Genoa velvet, and a huge decorative design by Boucher covered the ceiling, a design for which the architect had paid a hundred thousand francs at the sale of the Chateau de Dampierre. The lusters and the crystal ornaments lit up a luxurious display of mirrors and precious furniture. It seemed as though Sabine's long chair, that solitary red silk chair, whose soft contours were so marked in the old days, had grown and spread till it filled the whole great house with voluptuous idleness and a sense of tense enjoyment not less fierce and hot than a fire which has been long in burning up.

The band, which had been located in the garden, in front of one of the open windows, was playing a waltz, the supple rhythm of which came softly into the house through the intervening night air. And the garden seemed to spread away and away, bathed in transparent shadow and lit by Venetian lamps, while in a purple tent pitched on the edge of a lawn a table for refreshments had been established. The waltz, which was none other than the quaint, vulgar one in the Blonde Venus, with its laughing, blackguard lilt, penetrated the old hotel with sonorous waves of sound and sent a feverish thrill along its walls. It was as though some fleshly wind had come up out of the common street and were sweeping the relics of a vanished epoch out of the proud old dwelling, bearing away the Muffats' past, the age of honor and religious faith which had long slumbered beneath the lofty ceilings.

The ladies, however, shook their heads, while Mme Hugon, herself somewhat embarrassed, kept harking back to the extreme respectability of his family. She was very much fatigued and complained of her feet. For some months she had been occupying her house in the Rue Richelieu, having, as she said, a whole lot of things on hand.

A quadrille was about to begin, and the crowd flowed back to the sides of the drawing room in order to leave the floor clear. Bright dresses flitted by and mingled together amid the dark evening coats, while the intense light set jewels flashing and white plumes quivering and lilacs and roses gleaming and flowering amid the sea of many heads. It was already very warm, and a penetrating perfume was exhaled from light tulles and crumpled silks and satins, from which bare shoulders glimmered white, while the orchestra played its lively airs. Through open doors ranges of seated ladies were visible in the background of adjoining rooms; they flashed a discreet smile; their eyes glowed, and they made pretty mouths as the breath of their fans caressed their faces. And guests still kept arriving, and a footman announced their names while gentlemen advanced slowly amid the surrounding groups, striving to find places for ladies, who hung with difficulty on their arms, and stretching forward in quest of some far-off vacant armchair. The house kept filling, and crinolined skirts got jammed together with a little rustling sound. There were corners where an amalgam of laces, bunches and puffs would completely bar the way, while all the other ladies stood waiting, politely resigned and imperturbably graceful, as became people who were made to take part in these dazzling crushes. Meanwhile across the garden couples, who had been glad to escape from the close air of the great drawing room, were wandering away under the roseate gleam of the Venetian lamps, and shadowy dresses kept flitting along the edge of the lawn, as though in rhythmic time to the music of the quadrille, which sounded sweet and distant behind the trees.

A fresh quadrille was imparting a slight swaying motion to the drawing-room floor, as though the old dwelling had been shaken by the impulse of the dance. Now and again amid the wan confusion of heads a woman's face with shining eyes and parted lips stood sharply out as it was whirled away by the dance, the light of the lusters gleaming on the white skin. Mme du Joncquoy declared that the present proceedings were senseless. It was madness to crowd five hundred people into a room which would scarcely contain two hundred. In fact, why not sign the wedding contract on the Place du Carrousel? This was the outcome of the new code of manners, said Mme Chantereau. In old times these solemnities took place in the bosom of the family, but today one must have a mob of people; the whole street must be allowed to enter quite freely, and there must be a great crush, or else the evening seems a chilly affair. People now advertised their luxury and introduced the mere foam on the wave of Parisian society into their houses, and accordingly it was only too natural if illicit proceedings such as they had been discussing afterward polluted the hearth. The ladies complained that they could not recognize more than fifty people. Where did all this crowd spring from? Young girls with low necks were making a great display of their shoulders. A woman had a golden dagger stuck in her chignon, while a bodice thickly embroidered with jet beads clothed her in what looked like a coat of mail. People's eyes kept following another lady smilingly, so singularly marked were her clinging skirts. All the luxuriant splendor of the departing winter was there—the overtolerant world of pleasure, the scratch gathering a hostess can get together after a first introduction, the sort of society, in fact, in which great names and great shames jostle together in the same fierce quest of enjoyment. The heat was increasing, and amid the overcrowded rooms the quadrille unrolled the cadenced symmetry of its figures.

Meanwhile Fauchery, though he listened, seemed preoccupied, for during a quarrel that morning Rose had roundly confessed to the sending of the letter. Oh yes, he might present himself at his great lady's house; he would be well received! After long hesitation he had come despite everything—out of sheer courage.

Fauchery had begun by bowing to the countess, who was still smiling in ecstatic serenity. After which he had stood motionless a moment, waiting very calmly behind the count's back. That evening the count's deportment was one of lofty gravity: he held his head high, as became the official and the great dignitary. And when at last he lowered his gaze in the direction of the journalist he seemed still further to emphasize the majesty of his attitude. For some seconds the two men looked at one another. It was Fauchery who first stretched out his hand. Muffat gave him his. Their hands remained clasped, and the Countess Sabine with downcast eyes stood smiling before them, while the waltz continually beat out its mocking, vagabond rhythm.

A memory he could not forget brought a faint glow to Fanchery's pale cheeks, and in his mind's eye he saw the property room bathed in greenish twilight and filled with dusty bric-a-brac. And Muffat was there, eggcup in hand, making a clever use of his suspicions. At this moment Muffat was no longer suspicious, and the last vestige of his dignity was crumbling in ruin. Fauchery's fears were assuaged, and when he saw the frank gaiety of the countess he was seized with a desire to laugh. The thing struck him as comic.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2597" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们的手粘在一起了吗？”富卡蒙问道，他见他们握手时间那么长，觉得挺奇怪。 福什利的脑海里不由自主地浮现了一件往事，这使他苍白的面颊上泛起了红晕。他仿佛又看见了那间道具仓库，那暗绿色的光线，杂乱无章的道具上都积满了灰尘；缪法站在那里，手里拿着蛋杯，满腹疑虑。可是，此时此刻，缪法不再疑虑了，他的尊严的最后一个角落也崩溃了。福什利松了口气，不再惧怕了，他见伯爵夫人那样爽朗快乐，真想大笑一阵。这个场面在他看来很滑稽。

The band blew louder trills from their little flutes; their violins sent forth more swooning notes. Beneath the Genoa velvet hangings, the gilding and the paintings, the lusters exhaled a living heat and a great glow of sunlight, while the crowd of guests, multiplied in the surrounding mirrors, seemed to grow and increase as the murmur of many voices rose ever louder. The couples who whirled round the drawing room, arm about waist, amid the smiles of the seated ladies, still further accentuated the quaking of the floors. In the garden a dull, fiery glow fell from the Venetian lanterns and threw a distant reflection of flame over the dark shadows moving in search of a breath of air about the walks at its farther end. And this trembling of walls and this red glow of light seemed to betoken a great ultimate conflagration in which the fabric of an ancient honor was cracking and burning on every side. The shy early beginnings of gaiety, of which Fauchery one April evening had heard the vocal expression in the sound of breaking glass, had little by little grown bolder, wilder, till they had burst forth in this festival. Now the rift was growing; it was crannying the house and announcing approaching downfall. Among drunkards in the slums it is black misery, an empty cupboard, which put an end to ruined families; it is the madness of drink which empties the wretched beds. Here the waltz tune was sounding the knell of an old race amid the suddenly ignited ruins of accumulated wealth, while Nana, although unseen, stretched her lithe limbs above the dancers' heads and sent corruption through their caste, drenching the hot air with the ferment of her exhalations and the vagabond lilt of the music.

At first, in her great surprise, the countess drew back from him. But she was still smiling the intoxicated smile which she now always wore. He began stammering in extreme embarrassment; whereupon she gave him a short moral lecture. However, neither of them risked a decisive explanation. It was religion, they pretended, which required this process of mutual forgiveness, and they agreed by a tacit understanding to retain their freedom. Before going to bed, seeing that the countess still appeared to hesitate, they had a business conversation, and the count was the first to speak of selling the Bordes. She consented at once. They both stood in great want of money, and they would share and share alike. This completed the reconciliation, and Muffat, remorseful though he was, felt veritably relieved.

</p></origin><translate id="div_2605" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是谁？”

</p></origin><translate id="div_2607" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么，原来是你！今天是你结婚的日子！……你来干什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2608');"><p>Taken aback by the darkness, he stood still in the middle of the room. However, he grew used to it and came forward at last. He was in evening dress and wore a white cravat and gloves.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2608" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他刚进黑暗的房间，还很不适应，只好站在屋子中央。不过，他很快就适应了，并向娜娜走过去。他身穿礼服，打着领带，戴着白手套。他连连说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2609');"><p>"Yes, to be sure, it's me!" he said. "You don't remember?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2609" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是呀，对，是我……怎么，你想不起来啦？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2610');"><p>No, she remembered nothing, and in his chaffing way he had to offer himself frankly to her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2610" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>是的，娜娜一点也想不起来了。他只好用开玩笑的神情直截了当地说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2611');"><p>"Come now, here's your commission. I've brought you the handsel of my innocence!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2611" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我是来答谢你给我当媒人的……我把我的童贞初夜带给你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2612');"><p>And with that, as he was now by the bedside, she caught him in her bare arms and shook with merry laughter and almost cried, she thought it so pretty of him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2612" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>达盖内走到床边时，娜娜伸出赤裸的胳膊搂住他，她笑得浑身发抖，差点流出泪来，她觉得达盖内太可爱了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2613');"><p>"Oh, that Mimi, how funny he is! He's thought of it after all! And to think I didn't remember it any longer! So you've slipped off; you're just out of church. Yes, certainly, you've got a scent of incense about you. But kiss me, kiss me! Oh, harder than that, Mimi dear! Bah! Perhaps it's for the last time."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2613" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！这个咪味，真滑稽！……他还想得到，我倒忘得干干净净了！那么，你出了教堂，就溜掉了。一点不错，你身上还有一股圣香味呢……吻我吧！啊！使点劲，我的咪咪！吻吧，这也许是最后一次了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2614');"><p>In the dim room, where a vague odor of ether still lingered, their tender laughter died away suddenly. The heavy, warm breeze swelled the window curtains, and children's voices were audible in the avenue without. Then the lateness of the hour tore them asunder and set them joking again. Daguenet took his departure with his wife directly after the breakfast.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2614" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>光线幽暗的卧室里，还可隐约闻到一股乙醚气味，他们温情的笑声停止了，一股热风吹拂着窗帘，他们听见街上孩子们的喧闹声。随后，由于时间急迫，他们笑闹了一会就分手了。达盖内在冷餐酒会后，立即同妻子出发旅行去了。
