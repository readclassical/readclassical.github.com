</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1518');"><p>We are in a little set of lodgings on the fourth floor in the Rue Veron at Montmartre. Nana and Fontan have invited a few friends to cut their Twelfth-Night cake with them. They are giving their housewarming, though they have been only three days settled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1518" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在蒙马特区韦龙街的一幢房子的五层楼上，娜娜和丰唐请来几个朋友吃三王来朝节饼，以此来庆祝乔迁之喜，他们搬到这里已有三天了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1519');"><p>They had no fixed intention of keeping house together, but the whole thing had come about suddenly in the first glow of the honeymoon. After her grand blowup, when she had turned the count and the banker so vigorously out of doors, Nana felt the world crumbling about her feet. She estimated the situation at a glance; the creditors would swoop down on her anteroom, would mix themselves up with her love affairs and threaten to sell her little all unless she continued to act sensibly. Then, too, there would be no end of disputes and carking anxieties if she attempted to save her furniture from their clutches. And so she preferred giving up everything. Besides, the flat in the Boulevard Haussmann was plaguing her to death. It was so stupid with its great gilded rooms! In her access of tenderness for Fontan she began dreaming of a pretty little bright chamber. Indeed, she returned to the old ideals of the florist days, when her highest ambition was to have a rosewood cupboard with a plate-glass door and a bed hung with blue "reps." In the course of two days she sold what she could smuggle out of the house in the way of knickknacks and jewelry and then disappeared, taking with her ten thousand francs and never even warning the porter's wife. It was a plunge into the dark, a merry spree; never a trace was left behind. In this way she would prevent the men from coming dangling after her. Fontain was very nice. He did not say no to anything but just let her do as she liked. Nay, he even displayed an admirable spirit of comradeship. He had, on his part, nearly seven thousand francs, and despite the fact that people accused him of stinginess, he consented to add them to the young woman's ten thousand. The sum struck them as a solid foundation on which to begin housekeeping. And so they started away, drawing from their common hoard, in order to hire and furnish the two rooms in the Rue Veron, and sharing everything together like old friends. In the early days it was really delicious.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1519" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们本来并未打算住在一起，这是在蜜月的热恋中突然决定的。在她大动肝火，断然把伯爵和银行家赶出门的第二天，她感到自己周围的一切都土崩瓦解了。现在她对自己的前景一下看得清清楚楚了：债主们就要涌进她的候见厅里，他们甚至会干涉他们的爱情，并扬言拍卖她的一切，如果她不听从他们的安排的话；为了让他们给她留下四件家具，必须要同他们没完没了地争吵，直到吵得头昏脑胀。她宁愿什么都不要。另外，奥斯曼大街的那套住宅她住厌了。这套房子的色调很简单，几个大房间全都涂刷成金黄色。在她与丰唐热恋的时候，她就梦想有一间漂亮、明亮的卧室，仿佛她过去当卖花姑娘时的理想在她的脑海中重现了，不过那时所理想的只是一个带穿衣镜的红木衣柜和一张挂蓝色棱纹布帐子的床。两天之内，她卖掉了她能够卖掉的一切东西，如小摆设和珠宝饰，随后，她带着一万法郎悄然离去，连跟女门房都没打一声招呼。娜娜溜走了，离家出走了，没有留下一点踪迹。这样一走，那些男人就不来缠住她不放了。丰唐很听话。娜娜要搬走，他连个“不”字都未说。她爱怎么做就让她怎么做。他甚至像一个好伙伴那样行事。他有近七千法郎，尽管有人说他很吝啬，他还是同意拿出来，与娜娜的一万法郎放在一起。在他们看来，这笔钱似乎是一笔建立一个牢固家庭的资金。从此，他们花钱便从两人放在一起的钱中拿，租下韦龙街的两间房子，并在里面配备了家具，像老朋友一样分享着一切。起初，日子过得很甜蜜。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1520');"><p>On Twelfth Night Mme Lerat and Louiset were the first to arrive. As Fontan had not yet come home, the old lady ventured to give expression to her fears, for she trembled to see her niece renouncing the chance of wealth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1520" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>三王来朝节那天晚上，勒拉太太带着小路易第一个来到。因为丰唐没有回来，她便大胆说出了她对侄女的担心，因为她看到娜娜放弃了发财的机会，对此，她心里感到惶惶不安。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1521');"><p>"Oh, Aunt, I love him so dearly!" cried Nana, pressing her hands to her heart with the prettiest of gestures.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1521" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！姑妈，我多么爱他！”娜娜一边大声说着，一边做了一个优美的姿势，把双手合拢，放在胸前。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1522');"><p>This phrase produced an extraordinary effect on Mme Lerat, and tears came into her eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1522" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这句话对勒拉太太产生不寻常的效果。她的眼里涌出了泪水。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1523');"><p>"That's true," she said with an air of conviction. "Love before all things!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1523" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这话倒是真的，”她坚信不疑地说，“爱情是高于一切的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1524');"><p>And with that she went into raptures over the prettiness of the rooms. Nana took her to see the bedroom, the parlor and the very kitchen. Gracious goodness, it wasn't a vast place, but then, they had painted it afresh and put up new wallpapers. Besides, the sun shone merrily into it during the daytime.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1524" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，她对几个房间的雅致漂亮，赞不绝口。娜娜带她去看卧室，餐厅，连厨房也看了。当然罗！卧室并不宽敞，墙壁都重新粉刷过了，更换了糊墙纸；阳光射进来，给人以惬意之感。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1525');"><p>Thereupon Mme Lerat detained the young woman in the bedroom, while Louiset installed himself behind the charwoman in the kitchen in order to watch a chicken being roasted. If, said Mme Lerat, she permitted herself to say what was in her mind, it was because Zoe had just been at her house. Zoe had stayed courageously in the breach because she was devoted to her mistress. Madame would pay her later on; she was in no anxiety about that! And amid the breakup of the Boulevard Haussmann establishment it was she who showed the creditors a bold front; it was she who conducted a dignified retreat, saving what she could from the wreck and telling everyone that her mistress was traveling. She never once gave them her address. Nay, through fear of being followed, she even deprived herself of the pleasure of calling on Madame. Nevertheless, that same morning she had run round to Mme Lerat's because matters were taking a new turn. The evening before creditors in the persons of the upholsterer, the charcoal merchant and the laundress had put in an appearance and had offered to give Madame an extension of time. Nay, they had even proposed to advance Madame a very considerable amount if only Madame would return to her flat and conduct herself like a sensible person. The aunt repeated Zoe's words. Without doubt there was a gentleman behind it all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1525" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>勒拉太太让小路易呆在厨房里，他站在女佣人后面，看她烤制母鸡，而她把娜娜留在卧室里。她有些话想直截了当跟娜娜谈谈，因为佐爱刚刚去过她家。佐爱对女主人一片忠心，她一直留在原来的住宅里大胆地应付局面。工钱吗，太太迟付一些，她也无所谓。在奥斯曼大街那套凌乱不堪的住宅里，是她应付了许多债主，组织了体面的撤退，挽救了一些残存的东西，她总是对债主们说，太太出外旅行了，从来不告诉他们她的去向。由于害怕被人跟踪，她放弃了来看望太太的兴趣。然而，今天早上，她来到勒拉太太家，是因为出现了新情况。昨天晚上，一些债主来了，他们当中有地毯商、煤炭商、洗衣妇，他们提出可以放宽还债的期限，甚至说可以借一大笔钱给太太，只要太太回到她的住所，做事聪明一些。姑妈转达了佐爱的话，说这件事情背后，很可能有一个男人在出谋划策。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1526');"><p>"I'll never consent!" declared Nana in great disgust. "Ah, they're a pretty lot those tradesmen! Do they think I'm to be sold so that they can get their bills paid? Why, look here, I'd rather die of hunger than deceive Fontan."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1526" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“绝对不行！”娜娜愤怒地说，“这些商人真卑鄙龌龊！难道他们以为我得卖身来还他们的债吗！……你知道，我宁愿饿死，也不欺骗丰唐。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1527');"><p>"That's what I said," averred Mme Lerat. "'My niece,' I said, 'is too noble-hearted!'"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1527" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我也是这样回答他们的，”勒拉太太说道，“我的侄女心肠太好了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1528');"><p>Nana, however, was much vexed to learn that La Mignotte was being sold and that Labordette was buying it for Caroline Hequet at an absurdly low price. It made her angry with that clique. Oh, they were a regular cheap lot, in spite of their airs and graces! Yes, by Jove, she was worth more than the whole lot of them!
</p></origin><translate id="div_1528" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而，娜娜更恼火的是，她听说“藏娇楼”被出卖了，是拉博德特以低廉可笑的价格为卡罗利娜埃凯买下的。她对这帮人特别气愤，她们虽然装腔作势，其实，她们是真正的婊子。 嘿！一点不错，她比她们所有的人都好！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1529');"><p>"They can have their little joke out," she concluded, "but money will never give them true happiness! Besides, you know, Aunt, I don't even know now whether all that set are alive or not. I'm much too happy."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1529" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她们可以吹牛，”她下结论道，“但金钱永远不会给她们带来真正的幸福……况且，姑妈，这帮人是否还活着，我都表示怀疑。我现在生活得太幸福了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1530');"><p>At that very moment Mme Maloir entered, wearing one of those hats of which she alone understood the shape. It was delightful meeting again. Mme Maloir explained that magnificence frightened her and that NOW, from time to time, she would come back for her game of bezique. A second visit was paid to the different rooms in the lodgings, and in the kitchen Nana talked of economy in the presence of the charwoman, who was basting the fowl, and said that a servant would have cost too much and that she was herself desirous of looking after things. Louiset was gazing beatifically at the roasting process.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1530" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在这时候，马卢瓦太太来了，她戴着一顶奇形怪状的帽子，帽子的形状只有她自己说得出来。她们再次见面，大家都很高兴。马卢瓦太太说，以前她对大场面感到有些不自在；从现在起，她可以不时来打打牌了。她们又一次参观房子；在厨房里，她们看见女仆在烤鸡上浇卤汁，娜娜当着女仆的面，说要节省开支，雇个女佣人花费太大，她想自己操持家务。小路易出神地看着那台烤肉器。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1531');"><p>But presently there was a loud outburst of voices. Fontan had come in with Bosc and Prulliere, and the company could now sit down to table. The soup had been already served when Nana for the third time showed off the lodgings.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1531" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时听见一阵说话的声音。丰唐领着博斯克和普律利埃尔进来了。大家可以入席了。汤已经端上桌子了。这时娜娜第三次带领客人们参观住宅。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1532');"><p>"Ah, dear children, how comfortable you are here!" Bosc kept repeating, simply for the sake of pleasing the chums who were standing the dinner. At bottom the subject of the "nook," as he called it, nowise touched him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1532" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！孩子们，你们住在这里真舒适！”博斯克再三地说。他是在说客套话，奉承一下请客的主人，因为归根结蒂，他对自己所说的“窝”的问题毫无兴趣。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1533');"><p>In the bedroom he harped still more vigorously on the amiable note. Ordinarily he was wont to treat women like cattle, and the idea of a man bothering himself about one of the dirty brutes excited within him the only angry feelings of which, in his comprehensive, drunken disdain of the universe, he was still capable.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1533" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>进了卧室，他的恭维话说得更动听了。平常，他把女人视为畜生，他一想到一个男子汉受到这样一个肮脏的畜生的约束，而这种事也可能在他自己身上发生，他内心就很气愤。这是唯一能引起他愤怒的事，因为他总是像醉汉那样，用蔑视的态度来看待世界上的一切。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1534');"><p>"Ah, ah, the villains," he continued with a wink, "they've done this on the sly. Well, you were certainly right. It will be charming, and, by heaven, we'll come and see you!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1534" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！这两个人，”他眨着眼睛说道，“他们瞒着大家筑了这个安乐窝……说实话，你们做得对。他妈的！我们以后常来看你们，这倒是挺有意思的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1535');"><p>But when Louiset arrived on the scene astride upon a broomstick, Prulliere chuckled spitefully and remarked:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1535" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当小路易骑着一把扫帚进来时，普律利埃尔冷笑道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1536');"><p>"Well, I never! You've got a baby already?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1536" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！这个孩子已经是你们两个人的了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1537');"><p>This struck everybody as very droll, and Mme Lerat and Mme Maloir shook with laughter. Nana, far from being vexed, laughed tenderly and said that unfortunately this was not the case. She would very much have liked it, both for the little one's sake and for her own, but perhaps one would arrive all the same. Fontan, in his role of honest citizen, took Louiset in his arms and began playing with him and lisping.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1537" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这句话似乎很逗人。勒拉太太和马卢瓦太太笑弯了腰。娜娜不但一点没有生气，反而温情地笑了，她说小路易不是她与丰唐所生，非常遗憾，为了孩子和她自己的幸福，她宁愿这是事实；但是他们将来也许会再生一个孩子。丰唐做出一副和蔼可亲的样子，一下抱起孩子，还模仿他牙牙学语，逗他玩。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1538');"><p>"Never mind! It loves its daddy! Call me 'Papa,' you little blackguard!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1538" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这没关系，他喜欢他的小爸爸……小坏蛋，叫我爸爸吧！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1539');"><p>"Papa, Papa!" stammered the child.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1539" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“爸爸……爸爸……”孩子结结巴巴叫着。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1540');"><p>The company overwhelmed him with caresses, but Bosc was bored and talked of sitting down to table. That was the only serious business in life. Nana asked her guests' permission to put Louiset's chair next her own. The dinner was very merry, but Bosc suffered from the near neighborhood of the child, from whom he had to defend his plate. Mme Lerat bored him too. She was in a melting mood and kept whispering to him all sorts of mysterious things about gentlemen of the first fashion who were still running after Nana. Twice he had to push away her knee, for she was positively invading him in her gushing, tearful mood. Prulliere behaved with great incivility toward Mme Maloir and did not once help her to anything. He was entirely taken up with Nana and looked annoyed at seeing her with Fontan. Besides, the turtle doves were kissing so excessively as to be becoming positive bores. Contrary to all known rules, they had elected to sit side by side.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1540" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大家都去抚摸小路易。博斯克感到不耐烦了，叫大家入席吃饭，在他看来，吃饭才是正经事。娜娜要求让小路易坐在她身边。吃饭时的气氛很愉快。然而，博斯克感到孩子坐在他旁边，心里有些不痛快，因为他要随时提防孩子把他的盘子打翻。勒拉太太也使他感到不自在。她感情缠绵，悄声悄气地告诉他一些秘密的事情，说有些有身份的先生还在追求自己；她噙着泪水，两次把身子靠紧他，他不得不推开她的膝盖。普律利埃尔对马卢瓦太太也不礼貌，他一次也没有为她递过菜。他只注意着娜娜，看见她和丰唐在一起，心里怏怏不乐。何况这对年轻的情侣又频频接吻，这着实令人讨厌。他们置一切请客的礼仪于不顾，两人竟然紧挨着坐在一起。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1541');"><p>"Devil take it! Why don't you eat? You've got plenty of time ahead of you!" Bosc kept repeating with his mouth full. "Wait till we are gone!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1541" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真见鬼！你们还是吃饭吧，你们会有时间接吻的！”博斯克连连说道，嘴里塞满食物，“等我们走了以后再接吻吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1542');"><p>But Nana could not restrain herself. She was in a perfect ecstasy of love. Her face was as full of blushes as an innocent young girl's, and her looks and her laughter seemed to overflow with tenderness. Gazing on Fontan, she overwhelmed him with pet names—"my doggie, my old bear, my kitten"—and whenever he passed her the water or the salt she bent forward and kissed him at random on lips, eyes, nose or ear. Then if she met with reproof she would return to the attack with the cleverest maneuvers and with infinite submissiveness and the supple cunning of a beaten cat would catch hold of his hand when no one was looking, in order to kiss it again. It seemed she must be touching something belonging to him. As to Fontan, he gave himself airs and let himself be adored with the utmost condescension. His great nose sniffed with entirely sensual content; his goat face, with its quaint, monstrous ugliness, positively glowed in the sunlight of devoted adoration lavished upon him by that superb woman who was so fair and so plump of limb. Occasionally he gave a kiss in return, as became a man who is having all the enjoyment and is yet willing to behave prettily.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1542" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但是娜娜控制不住自己。她陶醉在爱情之中，两颊绯红得像处女。她笑个不停，眸子里充满温情，目光凝视着丰唐，用一连串的亲昵称呼呼唤丰唐：我的小狗，我的小狼，我的小猫儿。当他递水或递盐给她时，她就侧过身子，不顾一切地吻他的嘴唇，吻他的眼睛，吻他的鼻子和耳朵；如果有客人责备她，她就用巧妙的策略，装出猫挨打后的一副谦恭而又温顺的样子，坐直身子，暗暗抓起他的手，紧紧捏住不放，还要亲一亲。她一定要触到他身上的某个部分。丰唐拱着背，得意地任凭她抚爱。由于享受到性爱的快乐，他的大鼻子一张一合。他的山羊脸，又难看，又滑稽，像个丑八怪，由于受到这位白白胖胖女子的诚挚的爱慕，神态显得洋洋自得。他不时回报她一个吻，就像一个男人享受着各种乐趣时，想表现一下自己可爱的样子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1543');"><p>"Well, you're growing maddening!" cried Prulliere. "Get away from her, you fellow there!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1543" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“总之，你们两人真讨厌！”普律利埃尔嚷道，“你从这里滚开吧！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1544');"><p>And he dismissed Fontan and changed covers, in order to take his place at Nana's side. The company shouted and applauded at this and gave vent to some stiffish epigrammatic witticisms. Fontan counterfeited despair and assumed the quaint expression of Vulcan crying for Venus. Straightway Prulliere became very gallant, but Nana, whose foot he was groping for under the table, caught him a slap to make him keep quiet. No, no, she was certainly not going to become his mistress. A month ago she had begun to take a fancy to him because of his good looks, but now she detested him. If he pinched her again under pretense of picking up her napkin, she would throw her glass in his face!
</p></origin><translate id="div_1544" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，他把丰唐打发走了，换了一套餐具，坐到娜娜旁边的丰唐位置上。这一行动赢得了大伙的喝彩、鼓掌，他们还说了一些不堪入耳的话。丰唐装出一副失望的样子，露出火神哀哭爱神的神态。普律利埃尔马上对娜娜大献殷勤，用脚在桌子底下寻找娜娜的脚，娜娜对他猛踢一脚，叫他放老实一些。不，她肯定不会同他睡觉。上个月，因为他长相好，开始娜娜对他钟情过。而现在呢，娜娜恨他了，如果他装着捡餐巾去捏她的脚，她就把酒杯扔到他的脸上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1545');"><p>Nevertheless, the evening passed off well. The company had naturally begun talking about the Varietes. Wasn't that cad of a Bordenave going to go off the hooks after all? His nasty diseases kept reappearing and causing him such suffering that you couldn't come within six yards of him nowadays. The day before during rehearsal he had been incessantly yelling at Simonne. There was a fellow whom the theatrical people wouldn't shed many tears over. Nana announced that if he were to ask her to take another part she would jolly well send him to the rightabout. Moreover, she began talking of leaving the stage; the theater was not to compare with her home. Fontan, who was not in the present piece or in that which was then being rehearsed, also talked big about the joy of being entirely at liberty and of passing his evenings with his feet on the fender in the society of his little pet. And at this the rest exclaimed delightedly, treating their entertainers as lucky people and pretending to envy their felicity.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1545" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>不过，那天晚上总算过得愉快。大家很自然地谈起了游艺剧院。博尔德纳夫这个恶棍难道还没有死吗？他的下流病又复发了，使他痛苦不堪，他的脾气坏透了，别人都不敢碰他。昨天晚上，排演时，他不停地骂西蒙娜。这个人死了，全体演员不会为他流一滴眼泪！娜娜说如果他要她扮演一个角色，她会一口拒绝的；另外，她还说她不再演戏了，因为剧团生活总是比不上小家庭生活。丰唐在新上演的戏中，没有扮演角色，他在正在排演的戏中也没有担任任何角色，他还夸大其词地谈到他的幸福，他说自己完全自由了，晚上可以陪着他的小猫咪，坐在炉火前烤脚。在场的人都赞叹不已，说他们是幸运儿，装出一副羡慕他们的样子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1546');"><p>The Twelfth-Night cake had been cut and handed round. The bean had fallen to the lot of Mme Lerat, who popped it into Bosc's glass. Whereupon there were shouts of "The king drinks! The king drinks!" Nana took advantage of this outburst of merriment and went and put her arms round Fontan's neck again, kissing him and whispering in his ear. But Prulliere, laughing angrily, as became a pretty man, declared that they were not playing the game. Louiset, meanwhile, slept soundly on two chairs. It was nearing one o'clock when the company separated, shouting au revoir as they went downstairs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1546" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大家分吃了三王来朝节饼。勒拉太太分得了蚕豆，她把蚕豆放到博斯克的杯子里。这时候，大家齐声叫道：“国王喝酒！国王喝酒！”娜娜趁大家笑声不绝之际，又搂住丰唐的脖子，一边吻他，一边贴着他的耳朵说话。但是普律利埃尔露出漂亮小伙子恼火时的笑容，大声说他俩这样做不符合游戏的规则。小路易躺在两张椅子上睡觉了。快到十一点钟时，大伙终于分手了。大家走在楼梯上时，互相说声再见。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1547');"><p>For three weeks the existence of the pair of lovers was really charming. Nana fancied she was returning to those early days when her first silk dress had caused her infinite delight. She went out little and affected a life of solitude and simplicity. One morning early, when she had gone down to buy fish IN PROPRIA PERSONA in La Rouchefoucauld Market, she was vastly surprised to meet her old hair dresser Francis face to face. His getup was as scrupulously careful as ever: he wore the finest linen, and his frock coat was beyond reproach; in fact, Nana felt ashamed that he should see her in the street with a dressing jacket and disordered hair and down-at-heel shoes. But he had the tact, if possible, to intensify his politeness toward her. He did not permit himself a single inquiry and affected to believe that Madame was at present on her travels. Ah, but Madame had rendered many persons unhappy when she decided to travel! All the world had suffered loss. The young woman, however, ended by asking him questions, for a sudden fit of curiosity had made her forget her previous embarrassment. Seeing that the crowd was jostling them, she pushed him into a doorway and, still holding her little basket in one hand, stood chatting in front of him. What were people saying about her high jinks? Good heavens! The ladies to whom he went said this and that and all sorts of things. In fact, she had made a great noise and was enjoying a real boom: And Steiner? M. Steiner was in a very bad way, would make an ugly finish if he couldn't hit on some new commercial operation. And Daguenet? Oh, HE was getting on swimmingly. M. Daguenet was settling down. Nana, under the exciting influence of various recollections, was just opening her mouth with a view to a further examination when she felt it would be awkward to utter Muffat's name. Thereupon Francis smiled and spoke instead of her. As to Monsieur le Comte, it was all a great pity, so sad had been his sufferings since Madame's departure.

His countess is making him one with every man she meets—yes, even with that good-for-nothing of a Fauchery.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1557');"><p>Nevertheless, the storm subsided at last. After all, they might jolly well what they liked! She looked upon them as so much filth underfoot! It would have soiled her to bother about people like that. She had a conscience of her own, she had! And Francis, seeing her thus giving herself away, what with her housewife's costume and all, became familiar and, at parting, made so bold as to give her some good advice. It was wrong of her to be sacrificing everything for the sake of an infatuation; such infatuations ruined existence. She listened to him with bowed head while he spoke to her with a pained expression, as became a connoisseur who could not bear to see so fine a girl making such a hash of things.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1557" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而，她还是平静下来了。总之，他们爱怎么说就怎么说吧，她把他们看得跟她的鞋子上的泥土一样。与这些人斤斤计较，简直玷污了自己，她问心无愧就行了。这时，弗朗西斯同她谈得随便了，看见她这样穿着家庭主妇的晨衣出来买菜，与她分手时，冒昧地对她提出一些忠告。她错了，为了一时的热恋而牺牲了一切，一时的热恋会毁掉自己的一生的。她低着头听他说下去。弗朗西斯说话时，脸上露出难过的神色，他像个过来人，看见这样漂亮的姑娘如此糟蹋了自己，心里很难受。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1558');"><p>"Well, that's my affair," she said at last "Thanks all the same, dear boy." She shook his hand, which despite his perfect dress was always a little greasy, and then went off to buy her fish. During the day that story about the kick on the bottom occupied her thoughts. She even spoke about it to Fontan and again posed as a sturdy woman who was not going to stand the slightest flick from anybody. Fontan, as became a philosophic spirit, declared that all men of fashion were beasts whom it was one's duty to despise. And from that moment forth Nana was full of very real disdain.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1558" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是我自己的事情，”她终于开了口，“不过，我还是要谢谢你，亲爱的。” 她与弗朗西斯握握手，虽然他衣冠楚楚，但手还是有点黏糊糊的；随后，她去买鱼了。整整一天里，她脑子里总是想到她被踢屁股的事。她甚至把这件事告诉了丰唐，她又装出一副泼妇的样子，说她决不允许别人手指弹她一下。丰唐摆出一副智力超人的样子，说一切大人先生都是一些衣冠禽兽，人们应该鄙视他们。从那时起，娜娜心里对他们充满了蔑视。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1559');"><p>That same evening they went to the Bouffes-Parisiens Theatre to see a little woman of Fontan's acquaintance make her debut in a part of some ten lines. It was close on one o'clock when they once more trudged up the heights of Montmartre. They had purchased a cake, a "mocha," in the Rue de la Chaussee-d'Antin, and they ate it in bed, seeing that the night was not warm and it was not worth while lighting a fire. Sitting up side by side, with the bedclothes pulled up in front and the pillows piled up behind, they supped and talked about the little woman. Nana thought her plain and lacking in style. Fontan, lying on his stomach, passed up the pieces of cake which had been put between the candle and the matches on the edge of the night table. But they ended by quarreling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1559" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在这天晚上，他们去意大利剧院观看丰唐认识的一个小娘儿们初次登台演出，这个角色的台词仅有十行。他们步行到蒙马特高地时，已快到深夜一点钟了。他们在当丹河堤街买了一块咖啡奶油蛋糕，回到家里在床上吃，因为天气不暖和，在床上吃，这样可以免得生火。他们并肩坐着，被子盖在肚子上，枕头垫在背后，他们一边吃夜点心，一边议论那个小娘儿们。娜娜觉得她长相丑陋，没有风度。丰唐趴卧着，切成块的蛋糕放在床头柜边沿上的蜡烛和火柴之间，丰唐把蛋糕递给娜娜。他们最后争吵起来。

</p></origin><translate id="div_1564" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丰唐吹熄了蜡烛。娜娜怒气未消，她继续说话，说她不愿意别人用这样的口气跟她说话，她习惯于受人尊敬。因为丰唐不理睬她，她也只好住口了。但是她不能入睡，在床上辗转反侧。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1567');"><p>In fact, there were crumbs in the bed. She felt them down to her middle; she was everywhere devoured by them. One single crumb was scorching her and making her scratch herself till she bled. Besides, when one eats a cake isn't it usual to shake out the bedclothes afterward? Fontan, white with rage, had relit the candle, and they both got up and, barefooted and in their night dresses, they turned down the clothes and swept up the crumbs on the sheet with their hands. Fontan went to bed again, shivering, and told her to go to the devil when she advised him to wipe the soles of his feet carefully. And in the end she came back to her old position, but scarce had she stretched herself out than she danced again. There were fresh crumbs in the bed!
</p></origin><translate id="div_1567" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>床上确实有蛋糕屑，她连大腿底下都感觉得到，她浑身发痒。就连一粒蛋糕屑也使她感到身上发痒，她搔痒，把皮都搔破了。在床上吃糕点，吃完以后，难道不该把被子抖一抖吗？丰唐憋了一肚子气，点燃了一枝烛蜡。两人都起来，穿着睡衣，光着脚，把被子掀开，用手把床单上的蛋糕屑掸掉。丰唐冷得浑身直打哆嗦，连忙又睡到床上，娜娜叫他擦擦脚，他叫她见鬼去吧。最后，她睡回原处，但是刚刚躺下，她又乱动起来，床上还有蛋糕屑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1568');"><p>"By Jove, it was sure to happen!" she cried. "You've brought them back again under your feet. I can't go on like this! No, I tell you, I can't go on like this!"

</p></origin><translate id="div_1569" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，她想从丰唐的身体上面跨过去，跳到地上。而丰唐很想睡觉，被她闹得忍无可忍，狠狠地掴了她一记耳光。耳光打得那样重，娜娜一下子把头枕到枕头上，乖乖地睡觉了。她被打得晕头转向。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1572');"><p>For a second or two he threatened her with a second slap, asking her at the same time if she meant to move again. Then he put out the light, settled himself squarely on his back and in a trice was snoring. But she buried her face in the pillow and began sobbing quietly to herself. It was cowardly of him to take advantage of his superior strength! She had experienced very real terror all the same, so terrible had that quaint mask of Fontan's become. And her anger began dwindling down as though the blow had calmed her. She began to feel respect toward him and accordingly squeezed herself against the wall in order to leave him as much room as possible. She even ended by going to sleep, her cheek tingling, her eyes full of tears and feeling so deliciously depressed and wearied and submissive that she no longer noticed the crumbs. When she woke up in the morning she was holding Fontain in her naked arms and pressing him tightly against her breast. He would never begin it again, eh? Never again? She loved him too dearly. Why, it was even nice to be beaten if he struck the blow!
</p></origin><translate id="div_1572" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>过了一会，他问她还敢不敢再动弹，若再动弹一下，就再掴她一记耳光。接着，他吹熄了蜡烛，仰面躺下，马上打起鼾来。娜娜呢，她把脸贴在枕头上，低声呜咽起来。滥用武力的人是孬种。但是，她心里确实害怕起来，刚才丰唐的那副滑稽面孔一下子变得多么可怕。她的火气慢慢消了，似乎是那记耳光让她平静下来。现在她对他反而尊敬起来，她把身子贴在紧靠巷子边的墙壁上，尽量多让一些地方给他。她脸上火辣辣的，眼泪汪汪，虽然疲惫不堪，却感到有味道。她被制服了，疲倦得连蛋糕屑也感觉不到了，终于睡着了。第二天早上，当她醒来时，她用赤裸的双臂搂住丰唐，把他紧紧地搂在怀里。他再也不会打她了，是吗？再不打她了。她太爱他了，挨他的耳光，也觉得有意思。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1573');"><p>After that night a new life began. For a mere trifle—a yes, a no—Fontan would deal her a blow. She grew accustomed to it and pocketed everything. Sometimes she shed tears and threatened him, but he would pin her up against the wall and talk of strangling her, which had the effect of rendering her extremely obedient. As often as not, she sank down on a chair and sobbed for five minutes on end. But afterward she would forget all about it, grow very merry, fill the little lodgings with the sound of song and laughter and the rapid rustle of skirts. The worst of it was that Fontan was now in the habit of disappearing for the whole day and never returning home before midnight, for he was going to cafes and meeting his old friends again. Nana bore with everything. She was tremulous and caressing, her only fear being that she might never see him again if she reproached him. But on certain days, when she had neither Mme Maloir nor her aunt and Louiset with her, she grew mortally dull. Thus one Sunday, when she was bargaining for some pigeons at La Rochefoucauld Market, she was delighted to meet Satin, who, in her turn, was busy purchasing a bunch of radishes. Since the evening when the prince had drunk Fontan's champagne they had lost sight of one another.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1573" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，他们又开始了一种新的生活。一句话不投机，丰唐就掴她几记耳光。她也习惯了，挨打就忍受着，有时，她也大声叫喊，威胁他；但是，当他把她硬逼到墙边，说要掐死她时，她就软下来。通常，她挨打后，倒在椅子上，呜咽五分钟。事后便把一切都忘了，又快乐起来，唱呀，笑呀，在屋子里跑来跑去，满屋里都听到她的裙子飘拂的声音。现在最糟糕的却是整天不见丰唐的踪影，他晚上要到深更半夜才回来；他经常逛咖啡馆，会见他的哥儿们。娜娜平时战战兢兢，对他温柔体贴，唯一担心的事是，她责备他几句，他就出去不回来。有些日子，马卢瓦太太没有来，姑妈和小路易也没有来，她一个人寂寞得要命。因此，一个星期天，她去拉罗什福科菜场买鸽子，正在讨价还价时，遇见了萨丹，她高兴极了。萨丹买了一把萝卜。自从那天晚上，丰唐请王子喝香槟酒以后，她们就再也没有见过面。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1574');"><p>"What? It's you! D'you live in our parts?" said Satin, astounded at seeing her in the street at that hour of the morning and in slippers too. "Oh, my poor, dear girl, you're really ruined then!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1574" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么？原来是你，你也住在这个区吗？”萨丹说道，在这种时刻，她见娜娜穿着拖鞋走在马路上，一下子愣住了，“啊！我可怜的姑娘，看来你也混得不好！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1575');"><p>Nana knitted her brows as a sign that she was to hold her tongue, for they were surrounded by other women who wore dressing gowns and were without linen, while their disheveled tresses were white with fluff. In the morning, when the man picked up overnight had been newly dismissed, all the courtesans of the quarter were wont to come marketing here, their eyes heavy with sleep, their feet in old down-at-heel shoes and themselves full of the weariness and ill humor entailed by a night of boredom. From the four converging streets they came down into the market, looking still rather young in some cases and very pale and charming in their utter unconstraint; in others, hideous and old with bloated faces and peeling skin. The latter did not the least mind being seen thus outside working hours, and not one of them deigned to smile when the passers-by on the sidewalk turned round to look at them. Indeed, they were all very full of business and wore a disdainful expression, as became good housewives for whom men had ceased to exist. Just as Satin, for instance, was paying for her bunch of radishes a young man, who might have been a shop-boy going late to his work, threw her a passing greeting:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1575" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜皱皱眉头，示意她住口，因为那儿还有别的妇女，她们都穿着室内便袍，内衣也不穿，披头散发，头发上沾满了白绒毛。每天早晨，这个地区的烟花女，刚把过夜的嫖客送走之后，就来这里买菜。她们睡眼惺忪，拖着旧鞋走路，一夜的烦恼把她们弄得疲惫不堪，个个心情沉重，她们从十字路口的各条街走向菜市场，有的还很年轻，脸色十分苍白，神态从容迷人；有的又老又丑，腹部鼓起，皮肤松弛，在接客以外的时间内，这副样子被人看见，也觉得无所谓。在人行道上，行人都回过头来看看她们，但她们当中谁也不露出一丝笑容，每个人都行色匆匆，神态像高傲的家庭主妇，在她们眼里，男人似乎不存在似的。就在萨丹付钱买一把萝卜时，有一个年轻男子，样子颇像一个上班迟到的职员，走过她的身边，对她说道：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1576');"><p>"Good morning, duckie."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1576" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“晚安，亲爱的。”

</p></origin><translate id="div_1578" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这个猪猡着了魔了吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1579');"><p>Then she fancied she recognized him. Three days ago toward midnight, as the was coming back alone from the boulevards, she had talked to him at the corner of the Rue Labruyere for nearly half an hour, with a view to persuading him to come home with her. But this recollection only angered her the more.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1579" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>后来她想起来似乎认识此人。三天前，将近午夜时分，她独自一人从大街上往回走时，在拉布吕耶尔街的拐角处同他交谈了近半个钟头，她想拉他到家里过夜。想到这件事，她心里更加气愤。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1580');"><p>"Fancy they're brutes enough to shout things to you in broad daylight!" she continued. "When one's out on business one ought to be respectfully treated, eh?"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1581');"><p>Nana had ended by buying her pigeons, although she certainly had her doubts of their freshness. After which Satin wanted to show her where she lived in the Rue Rochefoucauld close by. And the moment they were alone Nana told her of her passion for Fontan. Arrived in front of the house, the girl stopped with her bundle of radishes under her arm and listened eagerly to a final detail which the other imparted to her. Nana fibbed away and vowed that it was she who had turned Count Muffat out of doors with a perfect hail of kicks on the posterior.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1581" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜虽然怀疑鸽子不新鲜，最后还是买下来了。这时，萨丹想带她到家里看看，她住在拉罗什福科街，就在附近。等到只有她们两人时，娜娜告诉她自己对丰唐怎样钟情。到了自家门口时，矮个子萨丹停下脚步，伫立着，手臂下夹着那把萝卜，饶有兴趣地听娜娜详细讲最后一件事。她也撒谎了，赌咒说是她把缪法赶出门的，还朝他的屁股上狠狠连踢几脚。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1582');"><p>"Oh how smart!" Satin repeated. "How very smart! Kicks, eh? And he never said a word, did he? What a blooming coward! I wish I'd been there to see his ugly mug! My dear girl, you were quite right. A pin for the coin! When I'M on with a mash I starve for it! You'll come and see me, eh? You promise? It's the left-hand door. Knock three knocks, for there's a whole heap of damned squints about."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1582" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哦！踢得好！”萨丹连声说道，“踢得好！他什么也没敢说，对吗？他真是个胆小鬼！我当时在场看见他那副嘴脸就好了……亲爱的，你做得对。得了，金钱算什么！我呀，如果对一个男人一见钟情，我宁愿为他而死……嗯？你要常来看看我，你答应我吧，左边那个门，敲三下我就知道了，因为经常有许多讨厌鬼来捣乱。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1583');"><p>After that whenever Nana grew too weary of life she went down and saw Satin. She was always sure of finding her, for the girl never went out before six in the evening. Satin occupied a couple of rooms which a chemist had furnished for her in order to save her from the clutches of the police, but in little more than a twelvemonth she had broken the furniture, knocked in the chairs, dirtied the curtains, and that in a manner so furiously filthy and untidy that the lodgings seemed as though inhabited by a pack of mad cats. On the mornings when she grew disgusted with herself and thought about cleaning up a bit, chair rails and strips of curtain would come off in her hands during her struggle with superincumbent dirt. On such days the place was fouler than ever, and it was impossible to enter it, owing to the things which had fallen down across the doorway. At length she ended by leaving her house severely alone. When the lamp was lit the cupboard with plate-glass doors, the clock and what remained of the curtains still served to impose on the men. Besides, for six months past her landlord had been threatening to evict her. Well then, for whom should she be keeping the furniture nice? For him more than anyone else, perhaps! And so whenever she got up in a merry mood she would shout "Gee up!" and give the sides of the cupboard and the chest of drawers such a tremendous kick that they cracked again.

Even on the days when Satin went out to do her marketing she felt so tired on her return upstairs that she flung herself down on the bed and went to sleep again. During the day she dragged herself about and dozed off on chairs. Indeed, she did not emerge from this languid condition till the evening drew on and the gas was lit outside. Nana felt very comfortable at Satin's, sitting doing nothing on the untidy bed, while basins stood about on the floor at her feet and petticoats which had been bemired last night hung over the backs of armchairs and stained them with mud. They had long gossips together and were endlessly confidential, while Satin lay on her stomach in her nightgown, waving her legs above her head and smoking cigarettes as she listened. Sometimes on such afternoons as they had troubles to retail they treated themselves to absinthe in order, as they termed it, "to forget." Satin did not go downstairs or put on a petticoat but simply went and leaned over the banisters and shouted her order to the portress's little girl, a chit of ten, who when she brought up the absinthe in a glass would look furtively at the lady's bare legs. Every conversation led up to one subject—the beastliness of the men. Nana was overpowering on the subject of Fontan. She could not say a dozen words without lapsing into endless repetitions of his sayings and his doings. But Satin, like a good-natured girl, would listen unwearyingly to everlasting accounts of how Nana had watched for him at the window, how they had fallen out over a burnt dish of hash and how they had made it up in bed after hours of silent sulking. In her desire to be always talking about these things Nana had got to tell of every slap that he dealt her. Last week he had given her a swollen eye; nay, the night before he had given her such a box on the ear as to throw her across the night table, and all because he could not find his slippers. And the other woman did not evince any astonishment but blew out cigarette smoke and only paused a moment to remark that, for her part, she always ducked under, which sent the gentleman pretty nearly sprawling. Both of them settled down with a will to these anecdotes about blows; they grew supremely happy and excited over these same idiotic doings about which they told one another a hundred times or more, while they gave themselves up to the soft and pleasing sense of weariness which was sure to follow the drubbings they talked of. It was the delight of rediscussing Fontan's blows and of explaining his works and his ways, down to the very manner in which he took off his boots, which brought Nana back daily to Satin's place. The latter, moreover, used to end by growing sympathetic in her turn and would cite even more violent cases, as, for instance, that of a pastry cook who had left her for dead on the floor. Yet she loved him, in spite of it all! Then came the days on which Nana cried and declared that things could not go on as they were doing. Satin would escort her back to her own door and would linger an hour out in the street to see that he did not murder her. And the next day the two women would rejoice over the reconciliation the whole afternoon through. Yet though they did not say so, they preferred the days when threshings were, so to speak, in the air, for then their comfortable indignation was all the stronger.

They used to go out together, and thus it was that Satin one day took her friend to see another woman. This woman turned out to be that very Mme Robert who had interested Nana and inspired her with a certain respect ever since she had refused to come to her supper. Mme Robert lived in the Rue Mosnier, a silent, new street in the Quartier de l'Europe, where there were no shops, and the handsome houses with their small, limited flats were peopled by ladies. It was five o'clock, and along the silent pavements in the quiet, aristocratic shelter of the tall white houses were drawn up the broughams of stock-exchange people and merchants, while men walked hastily about, looking up at the windows, where women in dressing jackets seemed to be awaiting them. At first Nana refused to go up, remarking with some constraint that she had not the pleasure of the lady's acquaintance. But Satin would take no refusal. She was only desirous of paying a civil call, for Mme Robert, whom she had met in a restaurant the day before, had made herself extremely agreeable and had got her to promise to come and see her. And at last Nana consented. At the top of the stairs a little drowsy maid informed them that Madame had not come home yet, but she ushered them into the drawing room notwithstanding and left them there.

It was a stiff, middle-class room, hung with dark-colored fabrics, and suggested the conventional taste of a Parisian shopkeeper who has retired on his fortune. Nana was struck and did her best to make merry about it. But Satin showed annoyance and spoke up for Mme Robert's strict adherence to the proprieties. She was always to be met in the society of elderly, grave-looking men, on whose arms she leaned. At present she had a retired chocolate seller in tow, a serious soul. Whenever he came to see her he was so charmed by the solid, handsome way in which the house was arranged that he had himself announced and addressed its mistress as "dear child."

The choice of the restaurant involved infinite debate. Satin proposed various brewery bars, which Nana thought detestable, and at last persuaded her to dine at Laure's. This was a table d'hote in the Rue des Martyrs, where the dinner cost three francs.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1593');"><p>Tired of waiting for the dinner hour and not knowing what to do out in the street, the pair went up to Laure's twenty minutes too early. The three dining rooms there were still empty, and they sat down at a table in the very saloon where Laure Piedefer was enthroned on a high bench behind a bar. This Laure was a lady of some fifty summers, whose swelling contours were tightly laced by belts and corsets. Women kept entering in quick procession, and each, in passing, craned upward so as to overtop the saucers raised on the counter and kissed Laure on the mouth with tender familiarity, while the monstrous creature tried, with tears in her eyes, to divide her attentions among them in such a way as to make no one jealous. On the other hand, the servant who waited on the ladies was a tall, lean woman. She seemed wasted with disease, and her eyes were ringed with dark lines and glowed with somber fire. Very rapidly the three saloons filled up. There were some hundred customers, and they had seated themselves wherever they could find vacant places. The majority were nearing the age of forty: their flesh was puffy and so bloated by vice as almost to hide the outlines of their flaccid mouths. But amid all these gross bosoms and figures some slim, pretty girls were observable. These still wore a modest expression despite their impudent gestures, for they were only beginners in their art, who had started life in the ballrooms of the slums and had been brought to Laure's by some customer or other. Here the tribe of bloated women, excited by the sweet scent of their youth, jostled one another and, while treating them to dainties, formed a perfect court round them, much as old amorous bachelors might have done. As to the men, they were not numerous. There were ten or fifteen of them at the outside, and if we except four tall fellows who had come to see the sight and were cracking jokes and taking things easy, they behaved humbly enough amid this whelming flood of petticoats.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1593" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她们等待吃晚饭的时间，等得不耐烦了，在人行道上又不知干什么是好，便提早二十分钟进了洛尔饭店。三间餐厅里还没有人来。她们进了一间餐厅，在一张桌子旁边坐下来，老板娘洛尔彼尔德费尔端庄地坐在柜台后面的一张高凳子上。这个洛尔是一个年届半百的人，体态臃肿，皮带和胸衣紧紧地束在身上。女客们鱼贯而入，她们踮起脚尖，从柜台上的茶托上面探过身子，亲切而温存地吻一下洛尔的嘴巴。而洛尔这个怪物，眼睛里湿润润的，对待每个人都很热情，尽量不让有人产生嫉妒心。而那个侍候这些女客的女招待则相反，她既高又瘦，满脸麻子，眼皮发黑，眸子里发出暗淡的光芒。三间饭厅里很快坐满了客人。顾客有一百来人，她们随便找张桌子坐下，她们当中大部分人约摸四十来岁，她们都是大块头，肌肉臃肿，因为过分纵欲，浮肿的脸把松软的嘴巴都淹没了。然而，在这些胸脯滚圆、大腹便便的女人中间，也有几个身材苗条的姑娘，她们虽然举止轻浮，但神态还很天真。她们是从低级舞场里挑选出来的新手，是被一个女顾客带到洛尔饭店来的，而那一群肥胖的女人，一闻到她们身上散发出来的青春气息，便围住她们，你推我搡，像惴惴不安的老光棍向她们大献殷勤，竞相给她们买甜食。饭店里的男客，为数不多，至多十到十五人，在这潮水般的裙子中间，他们的态度十分谦恭，只有四个汉子是专门来看看这一场面的，他们说说笑笑，无拘无束。

It was the old substantial dinner you get in a country hotel and consisted of vol-au-vent a la financiere, fowl boiled in rice, beans with a sauce and vanilla creams, iced and flavored with burnt sugar. The ladies made an especial onslaught on the boiled fowl and rice: their stays seemed about to burst; they wiped their lips with slow, luxurious movements. At first Nana had been afraid of meeting old friends who might have asked her silly questions, but she grew calm at last, for she recognized no one she knew among that extremely motley throng, where faded dresses and lamentable hats contrasted strangely with handsome costumes, the wearers of which fraternized in vice with their shabbier neighbors. She was momentarily interested, however, at the sight of a young man with short curly hair and insolent face who kept a whole tableful of vastly fat women breathlessly attentive to his slightest caprice. But when the young man began to laugh his bosom swelled.

Nevertheless, she remarked in her sensible tone that there was no disputing about tastes or colors, for you never could tell what you yourself might one day have a liking for. So she ate her cream with an air of philosophy, though she was perfectly well aware that Satin with her great blue virginal eyes was throwing the neighboring tables into a state of great excitement. There was one woman in particular, a powerful, fair-haired person who sat close to her and made herself extremely agreeable. She seemed all aglow with affection and pushed toward the girl so eagerly that Nana was on the point of interfering.

The latter, looking, as was her wont, like a pretty brown mouse, nodded familiarly to the tall, lean serving maid and came and leaned upon Laure's counter. Then both women exchanged a long kiss. Nana thought such an attention on the part of a woman so distinguished looking very amusing, the more so because Mme Robert had quite altered her usual modest expression. On the contrary, her eye roved about the saloon as she kept up a whispered conversation. Laure had resumed her seat and once more settled herself down with all the majesty of an old image of Vice, whose face has been worn and polished by the kisses of the faithful. Above the range of loaded plates she sat enthroned in all the opulence which a hotelkeeper enjoys after forty years of activity, and as she sat there she swayed her bloated following of large women, in comparison with the biggest of whom she seemed monstrous.

When Satin, however, who was ravished at this treatment, insisted on finding room for her at the table, she vowed she had already dined. She had simply come up to look about her. As she stood talking behind her new friend's chair she leaned lightly on her shoulders and in a smiling, coaxing manner remarked:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1603');"><p>Nana unluckily failed to hear more. The conversation vexed her, and she was dying to tell this honest lady a few home truths. But the sight of a troop of new arrivals paralyzed her. It was composed of smart, fashionably dressed women who were wearing their diamonds. Under the influence of perverse impulse they had made up a party to come to Laure's—whom, by the by, they all treated with great familiarity—to eat the three-franc dinner while flashing their jewels of great price in the jealous and astonished eyes of poor, bedraggled prostitutes. The moment they entered, talking and laughing in their shrill, clear tones and seeming to bring sunshine with them from the outside world, Nana turned her head rapidly away. Much to her annoyance she had recognized Lucy Stewart and Maria Blond among them, and for nearly five minutes, during which the ladies chatted with Laure before passing into the saloon beyond, she kept her head down and seemed deeply occupied in rolling bread pills on the cloth in front of her. But when at length she was able to look round, what was her astonishment to observe the chair next to hers vacant! Satin had vanished.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1603" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可惜，这样的谈话娜娜不想再听下去了，听了使她恼火，她真想对这位正经女人斥责一番。可是，这时她看见来了一群女人，她顿时愣住了。新来的女人个个穿戴时髦，浓妆艳抹，手上戴着钻石戒指，她们成群结队来到洛尔饭店，对洛尔太太全用亲昵称呼与她讲话。她们受一种反常心态的驱使，想炫耀一下身上戴着的价值数十万法郎的珠宝首饰，才来这里吃每人三法郎的晚饭，好让那些身上脏兮兮的可怜的女孩子见了既惊讶又眼馋。她们一进门就大声嚷嚷，发出银铃般的笑声，仿佛把外边的阳光带了进来。娜娜赶紧掉头一看，认出她们当中有吕西斯图华和玛丽亚布隆两人，顿时心里很不高兴。这些女人在走进隔壁餐厅之前，与洛尔太太聊了近五分钟，其间，娜娜一直低着头，在台布上搓面包屑。后来，当她回过头来时，不禁呆若木鸡，她身边的椅子上没有人了，萨丹走了。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1607');"><p>Thereupon Nana understood that they would most likely make game of her and so said nothing more. She even kept her seat for some moments, as she did not wish to show how angry she felt. She could hear Lucy Stewart laughing at the end of the next saloon, where she was treating a whole table of little women who had come from the public balls at Montmartre and La Chapelle. It was very hot; the servant was carrying away piles of dirty plates with a strong scent of boiled fowl and rice, while the four gentlemen had ended by regaling quite half a dozen couples with capital wine in the hope of making them tipsy and hearing some pretty stiffish things. What at present most exasperated Nana was the thought of paying for Satin's dinner. There was a wench for you, who allowed herself to be amused and then made off with never a thank-you in company with the first petticoat that came by! Without doubt it was only a matter of three francs, but she felt it was hard lines all the same—her way of doing it was too disgusting. Nevertheless, she paid up, throwing the six francs at Laure, whom at the moment she despised more than the mud in the street. In the Rue des Martyrs Nana felt her bitterness increasing. She was certainly not going to run after Satin! It was a nice filthy business for one to be poking one's nose into! But her evening was spoiled, and she walked slowly up again toward Montmartre, raging against Mme Robert in particular. Gracious goodness, that woman had a fine cheek to go playing the lady—yes, the lady in the dustbin! She now felt sure she had met her at the Papillon, a wretched public-house ball in the Rue des Poissonniers, where men conquered her scruples for thirty sous. And to think a thing like that got hold of important functionaries with her modest looks! And to think she refused suppers to which one did her the honor of inviting her because, forsooth, she was playing the virtuous game! Oh yes, she'd get virtued! It was always those conceited prudes who went the most fearful lengths in low corners nobody knew anything about.

Fontan had come home in a sulk, for he, too, had been deserted by the friend who had been dining with him. He listened coldly to her explanations while she trembled lest he should strike her. It scared her to find him at home, seeing that she had not expected him before one in the morning, and she told him a fib and confessed that she had certainly spent six francs, but in Mme Maloir's society. He was not ruffled, however, and he handed her a letter which, though addressed to her, he had quietly opened. It was a letter from Georges, who was still a prisoner at Les Fondettes and comforted himself weekly with the composition of glowing pages. Nana loved to be written to, especially when the letters were full of grand, loverlike expressions with a sprinkling of vows. She used to read them to everybody. Fontan was familiar with the style employed by Georges and appreciated it. But that evening she was so afraid of a scene that she affected complete indifference, skimming through the letter with a sulky expression and flinging it aside as soon as read. Fontan had begun beating a tattoo on a windowpane; the thought of going to bed so early bored him, and yet he did not know how to employ his evening. He turned briskly round:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1610');"><p>It was the custom for him to write the letters in reply. He was wont to vie with the other in point of style. Then, too, he used to be delighted when Nana, grown enthusiastic after the letter had been read over aloud, would kiss him with the announcement that nobody but he could "say things like that." Thus their latent affections would be stirred, and they would end with mutual adoration.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1610" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>回信通常总是由丰唐替娜娜代写。他很讲究文笔。每当信写好后，他就大声读给她听。娜娜听后，总是兴奋地搂住他亲吻，大声说，只有他才能写出这样漂亮的句子，他听了也很高兴。这事使他们都兴奋不已，他们爱得更深了。

It was five pages long, and he spoke therein of "the delicious hours passed at La Mignotte, those hours of which the memory lingered like subtle perfume." He vowed "eternal fidelity to that springtide of love" and ended by declaring that his sole wish was to "recommence that happy time if, indeed, happiness can recommence."

And so instead of bursting out in loverlike speeches and exchanging kisses, as their wont was, they sat coldly facing one another at the table. Nevertheless, she poured him out a cup of tea.

She was dirty; she was stupid; she had knocked about in all sorts of low places! After that he waxed frantic over the money question. Did he spend six francs when he dined out? No, somebody was treating him to a dinner; otherwise he would have eaten his ordinary meal at home. And to think of spending them on that old procuress of a Maloir, a jade he would chuck out of the house tomorrow!

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1626');"><p>"Oh well, if you must get in a rage!" said Nana. "Why, the calculation's easily made! You haven't allowed for the furniture; besides, I've had to buy linen. Money goes quickly when one's settling in a new place."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1638');"><p>Nana, who was crying and gasping, thereupon held her breath. When he was in bed she choked with emotion and threw herself upon his breast with a wild burst of sobs. Their scuffles always ended thus, for she trembled at the thought of losing him and, like a coward, wanted always to feel that he belonged entirely to her, despite everything. Twice he pushed her magnificently away, but the warm embrace of this woman who was begging for mercy with great, tearful eyes, as some faithful brute might do, finally aroused desire. And he became royally condescending without, however, lowering his dignity before any of her advances. In fact, he let himself be caressed and taken by force, as became a man whose forgiveness is worth the trouble of winning. Then he was seized with anxiety, fearing that Nana was playing a part with a view to regaining possession of the treasury key. The light had been extinguished when he felt it necessary to reaffirm his will and pleasure.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1638" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜本来抽抽噎噎，这时屏住了呼吸。丰唐上床后，她感到憋的慌，便一下子钻进他的怀里，嚎啕大哭起来。他们打架后，总是这样和好的；她生怕失去丰唐，不管怎样，她忍气吞声，想看看他对她是否还有感情。他两次傲慢地把她推开，但是，这个女人像头忠于主人的牲口，她的一双大眼睛里噙着泪水哀求他，温柔地拥抱他，终于引起了他的性欲。他装出宽宏大量的样子，但决不降低身份迁就她；他任她抚摩，任她拼命求欢，他摆出一副架势，要得到他的宽恕，花点力气也是必要的。接着，他又不安起来，怕娜娜耍花招，想把抽屉的钥匙要回去。这时，蜡烛已经熄了，他觉得有必要重申一下自己的意愿。

From one week's end to the other the noise of slaps filled the air and resembled the ticking of a clock by which they regulated their existence. Through dint of being much beaten Nana became as pliable as fine linen; her skin grew delicate and pink and white and so soft to the touch and clear to the view that she may be said to have grown more good looking than ever. Prulliere, moreover, began running after her like a madman, coming in when Fontan was away and pushing her into corners in order to snatch an embrace. But she used to struggle out of his grasp, full of indignation and blushing with shame. It disgusted her to think of him wanting to deceive a friend. Prulliere would thereupon begin sneering with a wrathful expression. Why, she was growing jolly stupid nowadays! How could she take up with such an ape? For, indeed, Fontan was a regular ape with that great swingeing nose of his. Oh, he had an ugly mug! Besides, the man knocked her about too!

He shrugged his shoulders behind Prulliere's back—a pretty fellow, to be sure, but a frivolous! Bosc had on more than one occasion assisted at domestic scenes, and at dessert, when Fontan slapped Nana, he went on chewing solemnly, for the thing struck him as being quite in the course of nature. In order to give some return for his dinner he used always to go into ecstasies over their happiness. He declared himself a philosopher who had given up everything, glory included. At times Prulliere and Fontan lolled back in their chairs, losing count of time in front of the empty table, while with theatrical gestures and intonation they discussed their former successes till two in the morning. But he would sit by, lost in thought, finishing the brandy bottle in silence and only occasionally emitting a little contemptuous sniff. Where was Talma's tradition? Nowhere. Very well, let them leave him jolly well alone! It was too stupid to go on as they were doing!

Accordingly she never ceased inveighing against that brutal individual.

I remarked at the time that you might put up with the beatings but that I would never have allowed him to be lacking in proper respect. In fact, there isn't a word to be said for him. I wouldn't have his portrait in my room even!

Doubtless she was willing to make sacrifices and to keep the child by her whatever might happen while waiting for more prosperous times, but the thought that Fontan was preventing her and the brat and its mother from swimming in a sea of gold made her so savage that she was ready to deny the very existence of true love. Accordingly she ended up with the following severe remarks:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1655');"><p>Soon money began to engross Nana's whole attention. Fontan had caused the seven thousand francs to vanish away. Without doubt they were quite safe; indeed, she would never have dared ask him questions about them, for she was wont to be blushingly diffident with that bird, as Mme Lerat called him. She trembled lest he should think her capable of quarreling with him about halfpence. He had certainly promised to subscribe toward their common household expenses, and in the early days he had given out three francs every morning. But he was as exacting as a boarder; he wanted everything for his three francs—butter, meat, early fruit and early vegetables—and if she ventured to make an observation, if she hinted that you could not have everything in the market for three francs, he flew into a temper and treated her as a useless, wasteful woman, a confounded donkey whom the tradespeople were robbing. Moreover, he was always ready to threaten that he would take lodgings somewhere else. At the end of a month on certain mornings he had forgotten to deposit the three francs on the chest of drawers, and she had ventured to ask for them in a timid, roundabout way. Whereupon there had been such bitter disputes and he had seized every pretext to render her life so miserable that she had found it best no longer to count upon him. Whenever, however, he had omitted to leave behind the three one-franc pieces and found a dinner awaiting him all the same, he grew as merry as a sandboy, kissed Nana gallantly and waltzed with the chairs. And she was so charmed by this conduct that she at length got to hope that nothing would be found on the chest of drawers, despite the difficulty she experienced in making both ends meet. One day she even returned him his three francs, telling him a tale to the effect that she still had yesterday's money. As he had given her nothing then, he hesitated for some moments, as though he dreaded a lecture. But she gazed at him with her loving eyes and hugged him in such utter self-surrender that he pocketed the money again with that little convulsive twitch or the fingers peculiar to a miser when he regains possession of that which has been well-nigh lost. From that day forth he never troubled himself about money again or inquired whence it came. But when there were potatoes on the table he looked intoxicated with delight and would laugh and smack his lips before her turkeys and legs of mutton, though of course this did not prevent his dealing Nana sundry sharp smacks, as though to keep his hand in amid all his happiness.

She roamed the streets and loitered on the pavement in quest of a five-franc piece, just as when she was a slipshod baggage years ago. One Sunday at La Rochefoucauld Market she had made her peace with Satin after having flown at her with furious reproaches about Mme Robert. But Satin had been content to answer that when one didn't like a thing there was no reason why one should want to disgust others with it. And Nana, who was by way of being wide-minded, had accepted the philosophic view that you never can tell where your tastes will lead you and had forgiven her. Her curiosity was even excited, and she began questioning her about obscure vices and was astounded to be adding to her information at her time of life and with her knowledge. She burst out laughing and gave vent to various expressions of surprise. It struck her as so queer, and yet she was a little shocked by it, for she was really quite the philistine outside the pale of her own habits. So she went back to Laure's and fed there when Fontan was dining out. She derived much amusement from the stories and the amours and the jealousies which inflamed the female customers without hindering their appetites in the slightest degree. Nevertheless, she still was not quite in it, as she herself phrased it. The vast Laure, meltingly maternal as ever, used often to invite her to pass a day or two at her Asnieries Villa, a country house containing seven spare bedrooms. But she used to refuse; she was afraid. Satin, however, swore she was mistaken about it, that gentlemen from Paris swung you in swings and played tonneau with you, and so she promised to come at some future time when it would be possible for her to leave town.

She needed money, and when the Tricon did not want her, which too often happened, she had no notion where to bestow her charms. Then began a series of wild descents upon the Parisian pavement, plunges into the baser sort of vice, whose votaries prowl in muddy bystreets under the restless flicker of gas lamps. Nana went back to the public-house balls in the suburbs, where she had kicked up her heels in the early ill-shod days. She revisited the dark corners on the outer boulevards, where when she was fifteen years old men used to hug her while her father was looking for her in order to give her a hiding. Both the women would speed along, visiting all the ballrooms and restaurants in a quarter and climbing innumerable staircases which were wet with spittle and spilled beer, or they would stroll quietly about, going up streets and planting themselves in front of carriage gates. Satin, who had served her apprenticeship in the Quartier Latin, used to take Nana to Bullier's and the public houses in the Boulevard Saint-Michel. But the vacations were drawing on, and the Quarter looked too starved. Eventually they always returned to the principal boulevards, for it was there they ran the best chance of getting what they wanted. From the heights of Montmartre to the observatory plateau they scoured the whole town in the way we have been describing. They were out on rainy evenings, when their boots got worn down, and on hot evenings, when their linen clung to their skins. There were long periods of waiting and endless periods of walking; there were jostlings and disputes and the nameless, brutal caresses of the stray passer-by who was taken by them to some miserable furnished room and came swearing down the greasy stairs afterward.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1661');"><p>The summer was drawing to a close, a stormy summer of burning nights. The pair used to start out together after dinner, toward nine o'clock. On the pavements of the Rue Notre Dame de la Lorette two long files of women scudded along with tucked-up skirts and bent heads, keeping close to the shops but never once glancing at the displays in the shopwindows as they hurried busily down toward the boulevards. This was the hungry exodus from the Quartier Breda which took place nightly when the street lamps had just been lit. Nana and Satin used to skirt the church and then march off along the Rue le Peletier. When they were some hundred yards from the Cafe Riche and had fairly reached their scene of operations they would shake out the skirts of their dresses, which up till that moment they had been holding carefully up, and begin sweeping the pavements, regardless of dust. With much swaying of the hips they strolled delicately along, slackening their pace when they crossed the bright light thrown from one of the great cafes. With shoulders thrown back, shrill and noisy laughter and many backward glances at the men who turned to look at them, they marched about and were completely in their element. In the shadow of night their artificially whitened faces, their rouged lips and their darkened eyelids became as charming and suggestive as if the inmates of a make-believe trumpery oriental bazaar had been sent forth into the open street. Till eleven at night they sauntered gaily along among the rudely jostling crowds, contenting themselves with an occasional "dirty ass!" hurled after the clumsy people whose boot heels had torn a flounce or two from their dresses. Little familiar salutations would pass between them and the cafe waiters, and at times they would stop and chat in front of a small table and accept of drinks, which they consumed with much deliberation, as became people not sorry to sit down for a bit while waiting for the theaters to empty. But as night advanced, if they had not made one or two trips in the direction of the Rue la Rochefoucauld, they became abject strumpets, and their hunt for men grew more ferocious than ever. Beneath the trees in the darkening and fast-emptying boulevards fierce bargainings took place, accompanied by oaths and blows. Respectable family parties—fathers, mothers and daughters—who were used to such scenes, would pass quietly by the while without quickening their pace. Afterward, when they had walked from the opera to the GYMNASE some half-score times and in the deepening night men were rapidly dropping off homeward for good and all, Nana and Satin kept to the sidewalk in the Rue du Faubourg Montmartre. There up till two o'clock in the morning restaurants, bars and ham-and-beef shops were brightly lit up, while a noisy mob of women hung obstinately round the doors of the cafes. This suburb was the only corner of night Paris which was still alight and still alive, the only market still open to nocturnal bargains. These last were openly struck between group and group and from one end of the street to the other, just as in the wide and open corridor of a disorderly house. On such evenings as the pair came home without having had any success they used to wrangle together. The Rue Notre Dame de la Lorette stretched dark and deserted in front of them. Here and there the crawling shadow of a woman was discernible, for the Quarter was going home and going home late, and poor creatures, exasperated at a night of fruitless loitering, were unwilling to give up the chase and would still stand, disputing in hoarse voices with any strayed reveler they could catch at the corner of the Rue Breda or the Rue Fontaine.

Satin had an especially keen scent for these. On rainy evenings, when the dripping city exhaled an unpleasant odor suggestive of a great untidy bed, she knew that the soft weather and the fetid reek of the town's holes and corners were sure to send the men mad. And so she watched the best dressed among them, for she knew by their pale eyes what their state was. On such nights it was as though a fit of fleshly madness were passing over Paris. The girl was rather nervous certainly, for the most modish gentlemen were always the most obscene. All the varnish would crack off a man, and the brute beast would show itself, exacting, monstrous in lust, a past master in corruption. But besides being nervous, that trollop of a Satin was lacking in respect. She would blurt out awful things in front of dignified gentlemen in carriages and assure them that their coachmen were better bred than they because they behaved respectfully toward the women and did not half kill them with their diabolical tricks and suggestions. The way in which smart people sprawled head over heels into all the cesspools of vice still caused Nana some surprise, for she had a few prejudices remaining, though Satin was rapidly destroying them.

No household work had been done for a week; her bed was disgusting, and ewers and basins were standing about in all directions. Nana expressed surprise at her knowing the marquis. Oh yes, she knew him! He had jolly well bored her confectioner and her when they were together. At present he used to come back now and then, but he nearly bothered her life out, going sniffing into all the dirty corners—yes, even into her slippers!

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1667');"><p>The sincerity of these low debauches rendered Nana especially uneasy. Seeing the courtesans around her slowly dying of it every day, she recalled to mind the comedy of pleasure she had taken part in when she was in the heyday of success. Moreover, Satin inspired her with an awful fear of the police. She was full of anecdotes about them. Formerly she had been the mistress of a plain-clothes man, had consented to this in order to be left in peace, and on two occasions he had prevented her from being put "on the lists." But at present she was in a great fright, for if she were to be nabbed again there was a clear case against her. You had only to listen to her! For the sake of perquisites the police used to take up as many women as possible. They laid hold of everybody and quieted you with a slap if you shouted, for they were sure of being defended in their actions and rewarded, even when they had taken a virtuous girl among the rest. In the summer they would swoop upon the boulevard in parties of twelve or fifteen, surround a whole long reach of sidewalk and fish up as many as thirty women in an evening. Satin, however, knew the likely places, and the moment she saw a plain-clothes man heaving in sight she took to her heels, while the long lines of women on the pavements scattered in consternation and fled through the surrounding crowd. The dread of the law and of the magistracy was such that certain women would stand as though paralyzed in the doorways of the cafes while the raid was sweeping the avenue without. But Satin was even more afraid of being denounced, for her pastry cook had proved blackguard enough to threaten to sell her when she had left him. Yes, that was a fake by which men lived on their mistresses! Then, too, there were the dirty women who delivered you up out of sheer treachery if you were prettier than they! Nana listened to these recitals and felt her terrors growing upon her. She had always trembled before the law, that unknown power, that form of revenge practiced by men able and willing to crush her in the certain absence of all defenders. Saint-Lazare she pictured as a grave, a dark hole, in which they buried live women after they had cut off their hair. She admitted that it was only necessary to leave Fontan and seek powerful protectors. But as matters stood it was in vain that Satin talked to her of certain lists of women's names, which it was the duty of the plainclothes men to consult, and of certain photographs accompanying the lists, the originals of which were on no account to be touched. The reassurance did not make her tremble the less, and she still saw herself hustled and dragged along and finally subjected to the official medical inspection. The thought of the official armchair filled her with shame and anguish, for had she not bade it defiance a score of times?
</p></origin><translate id="div_1667" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>尤其使娜娜深感不安的是萨丹坦率地对她讲的那些荒淫无耻的事情。她回想起当初沦落风尘时淫乐的可笑事情；而现在她看见自己周围的那些姑娘，在淫乐生活中，每天都有人毁了自己。另外，萨丹还使她对警察怕得要死。这方面，萨丹经历过不少事情。从前，她曾经同一个风化警察睡过觉，目的是避免有人找她麻烦；果然那个风化警察一连两次阻止了对她进行登记。现在，她胆战心惊，因为如果警察来抓她，她的妓女身份就暴露了。应当听她讲讲这方面的事情。警察为了得奖金，就尽量多抓妓女，他们见一个抓一个，一个不漏，谁叫喊，就给谁一个耳光，叫你闭嘴，在一大群娼妓中，他们即使错抓了一个正经女人，也会受到支持，得到奖赏。每到夏天，他们就十二个人一群，或十五个人一组，在环城林荫大道上进行大逮捕，包抄一条人行道，一个晚上，最多能抓到三十个妓女。不过，萨丹熟悉地形；只要她一发现一个警察的面孔，拔腿就跑，其他妓女也惊恐万状地跟着四下逃跑，在人群中形成几条长长的队伍。她们对法律和警察局怕得要命，当警察在一条马路上对她们进行大搜捕时，一些妓女呆在咖啡馆门口，吓得不敢动弹。而萨丹最害怕的是被人告发，那个糕点师就是一个没有教养的家伙，当她离他而去时，他威胁要出卖她；一点不错，一些男人就是使用这样的伎俩，让姘头来养活他们。还有一些卑鄙妓女，她们见别人长得比自己漂亮，就背信弃义地出卖别人。娜娜听她讲这些事情，越听越害怕。娜娜听到“法律”两个字就打哆嗦，法律的威力是不可知的，男人们可以用法律来报复她，把她置于死地，而世界上却不会有一个人来为她辩护。圣拉扎尔监狱①在她心目中似乎是一座坟墓，是活埋女人的黑坑，活埋之前，还要剃光她们的头发。她想她只要甩掉丰唐，她就能找到保护人。萨丹对她说，警察局有几份附上照片的妓女名单，警察抓人时都要查看这些名单，但是有保护人的妓女，他们是从来不碰一下的。尽管萨丹这样说，对她并未起作用，她浑身仍然打着哆嗦，她仿佛老是被警察推着走，拖着走，第二天就被拉去进行卫生体检。她一想到那张检查时自己坐的那张椅子，就感到惶惶不安，又感到羞耻，尽管她经常不顾廉耻，身上脱得一丝不挂。

Skirts streamed out behind and were torn. There were blows and shrieks. A woman fell down. The crowd of bystanders stood hilariously watching this rough police raid while the plain-clothes men rapidly narrowed their circle. Meanwhile Nana had lost Satin. Her legs were failing her, and she would have been taken up for a certainty had not a man caught her by the arm and led her away in front of the angry police. It was Prulliere, and he had just recognized her. Without saying a word he turned down the Rue Rougemont with her. It was just then quite deserted, and she was able to regain breath there, but at first her faintness and exhaustion were such that he had to support her. She did not even thank him.

Nevertheless, he was the first to regain his self-possession and to announce himself fortunate in meeting her. Yes, certainly, everybody was still wondering at Nana's total eclipse.

Nevertheless, she was struck by one thing: Labordette had given her exactly the same advice as Francis had given her. That evening when Fontan came home she questioned him about Fauchery's piece. The former had been back at the Varietes for two months past. Why then had he not told her about the part?
</p></origin><translate id="div_1689" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，她就走了。她的英雄气概使自己也深为感动。倘若一个混蛋男人作出这样的自我牺牲，就要大肆宣扬了。不过，她感到蹊跷的是，拉博德特刚才对她的劝告与弗朗西斯的劝告完全一样。晚上，丰唐回家后，她就问他福什利的剧本的事。丰唐回到游艺剧院演戏已有两个月了，为什么没有告诉她戏里缺一个角色的事呢？

But the harder he hit the more bravely she suffered, for she derived a certain bitter satisfaction from this heroic devotion of hers, which rendered her very great and very loving in her own eyes. Ever since she had gone with other men in order to supply his wants her love for him had increased, and the fatigues and disgusts encountered outside only added to the flame. He was fast becoming a sort of pet vice for which she paid, a necessity of existence it was impossible to do without, seeing that blows only stimulated her desires. He, on his part, seeing what a good tame thing she had become, ended by abusing his privileges. She was getting on his nerves, and he began to conceive so fierce a loathing for her that he forgot to keep count of his real interests. When Bosc made his customary remarks to him he cried out in exasperation, for which there was no apparent cause, that he had had enough of her and of her good dinners and that he would shortly chuck her out of doors if only for the sake of making another woman a present of his seven thousand francs. Indeed, that was how their liaison ended.

He had just had a padlock affixed to her door—quite illegally, of course, seeing that she had her own furniture. She swore and talked of having him up before the commissary of police. In the meantime, as midnight was striking, they had to begin thinking of finding a bed. And Satin, deeming it unwise to let the plain-clothes men into her secrets, ended by taking Nana to a woman who kept a little hotel in the Rue de Laval. Here they were assigned a narrow room on the first floor, the window of which opened on the courtyard. Satin remarked:

She refused to hear Fontan's name mentioned again, and each time it recurred to her friend's lips she stopped it with a kiss. Her lips pouted in pretty indignation; her hair lay loose about her, and her face glowed with tenderness and childlike beauty. Little by little her soft embrace compelled Nana to dry her tears. She was touched and replied to Satin's caresses. When two o'clock struck the candle was still burning, and a sound of soft, smothered laughter and lovers' talk was audible in the room.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1710');"><p>But suddenly a loud noise came up from the lower floors of the hotel, and Satin, with next to nothing on, got up and listened intently.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1710" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>忽然间，一阵喧闹声传到旅馆里，萨丹立刻半裸着身子坐起来，侧着耳朵仔细听着。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1711');"><p>"The police!" she said, growing very pale.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1711" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“警察！”她脸色煞白，说道，“啊！他妈的！真倒霉！…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1712');"><p>"Oh, blast our bad luck! We're bloody well done for!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1712" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我们完蛋啦！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1713');"><p>Often had she told stories about the raids on hotel made by the plainclothes men. But that particular night neither of them had suspected anything when they took shelter in the Rue de Laval. At the sound of the word "police" Nana lost her head. She jumped out of bed and ran across the room with the scared look of a madwoman about to jump out of the window. Luckily, however, the little courtyard was roofed with glass, which was covered with an iron-wire grating at the level of the girls' bedroom. At sight of this she ceased to hesitate; she stepped over the window prop, and with her chemise flying and her legs bared to the night air she vanished in the gloom.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1713" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从前，她曾多次向娜娜说过警察搜查旅馆的事，而恰巧在这天晚上，她们两人逃到拉瓦尔街时，谁也没有提防警察。听到警察两个字，娜娜吓得魂不附体。她猛然从床上跳下来，穿过房间，跑到窗户边，打开窗户，像一个疯女人似的丧魂落魄，准备往楼下跳。幸亏院子有玻璃顶棚，上面装着一层铁丝网，与房间的地面平齐。于是，她丝毫没有迟疑，跨过栏墙，消失在黑暗中，睡衣飘拂着，两条大腿露在夜空中。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1714');"><p>"Stop! Stop!" said Satin in a great fright. "You'll kill yourself."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1714" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别动，”萨丹惊恐万状地说，“你会摔死的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1715');"><p>Then as they began hammering at the door, she shut the window like a good-natured girl and threw her friend's clothes down into a cupboard. She was already resigned to her fate and comforted herself with the thought that, after all, if she were to be put on the official list she would no longer be so "beastly frightened" as of yore. So she pretended to be heavy with sleep. She yawned; she palavered and ended by opening the door to a tall, burly fellow with an unkempt beard, who said to her:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1715" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，警察砰砰敲门了。萨丹是一个好心肠的姑娘，她把窗户关上，把朋友的衣服塞到衣柜下面，她已听天由命了。她思量着，不管怎样，如果警察把她的名字写到登记卡上，她就是明娼了，不必这样心惊肉跳地逃避警察了。她装成困乏不堪的样子，一边打呵欠，一边同门外的警察谈了一会儿，然后开了门，进来一个彪形大汉，胡子很脏，他对她说道：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1716');"><p>"Show your hands! You've got no needle pricks on them: you don't work. Now then, dress!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1716" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“把手伸出来……你的手上没有针眼，你是不劳动的。喂，穿上衣服吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1717');"><p>"But I'm not a dressmaker; I'm a burnisher," Satin brazenly declared.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1717" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不是裁缝，我是磨光工。”萨丹厚颜无耻地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1718');"><p>Nevertheless, she dressed with much docility, knowing that argument was out of the question. Cries were ringing through the hotel; a girl was clinging to doorposts and refusing to budge an inch. Another girl, in bed with a lover, who was answering for her legality, was acting the honest woman who had been grossly insulted and spoke of bringing an action against the prefect of police. For close on an hour there was a noise of heavy shoes on the stairs, of fists hammering on doors, of shrill disputes terminating in sobs, of petticoats rustling along the walls, of all the sounds, in fact, attendant on the sudden awakening and scared departure of a flock of women as they were roughly packed off by three plain-clothes men, headed by a little oily-mannered, fair-haired commissary of police. After they had gone the hotel relapsed into deep silence.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1718" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>不过，她还是乖乖地穿上了衣服，因为她知道与警察是无法争辩的。这时候，旅馆里叫喊声四起，一个女人拼命地抱住房门，坚决不走；另一个女人正在同他的情夫睡觉，情夫保证说她不是妓女，于是她就装成一副被人侮辱的正经女人的样子，说要控告警察局长。旅馆里的人都被唤醒了，将近一个钟头，大皮鞋踩在楼梯上，发出咚咚声，门被拳头擂得摇摇晃晃，嚎啕大哭声淹没了尖锐的争吵声和裙子拂在墙壁上发出的声音。后来一群惊恐万状的妓女被三个警察带走了，领队的是一个很有礼貌的小个子金发警官。一切都结束了，旅馆里又恢复了寂静。

Her bare feet were cut and bleeding, for they had been torn by the grating. For a long while she remained sitting on the edge of the bed, listening and listening. Toward morning, however, she went to sleep again, and at eight o'clock, when she woke up, she escaped from the hotel and ran to her aunt's. When Mme Lerat, who happened just then to be drinking her morning coffee with Zoe, beheld her bedraggled plight and haggard face, she took note of the hour and at once understood the state of the case.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1719" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>没有人出卖娜娜，她逃过了这次逮捕。她摸索着回到卧室，浑身哆嗦着，她被吓得魂不附体。她的脚被铁丝网划得流血了。她在床边上坐了一会儿，侧着耳朵听四面的动静。然而快到早晨时，她还是睡着了。但是，到了早上八点钟，她醒来后，离开了旅馆，跑到她姑妈家。这时勒拉太太和佐爱正在喝牛奶咖啡，在这样的时刻，看见她浑身脏兮兮的，面色如土，勒拉太太立刻就明白是怎么回事。

</p></origin><translate id="div_1722" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“太太终于回到我们身边了……我一直在等太太回来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1723');"><p>But Mme Lerat insisted on Nana's going and kissing Louiset at once, because, she said, the child took delight in his mother's nice ways. Louiset, a sickly child with poor blood, was still asleep, and when Nana bent over his white, scrofulous face, the memory of all she had undergone during the last few months brought a choking lump into her throat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1723" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>勒拉太太要娜娜马上亲亲小路易，因为据她说，母亲的明智悔悟就是孩子的幸福。小路易还在睡觉，一副病态，他患了贫血症。娜娜俯身去吻他那患瘰疠病的苍白小脸时，这几个月来的烦恼一齐涌上了心头，她说话时喉咙都哽住了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1724');"><p>"Oh, my poor little one, my poor little one!" she gasped, bursting into a final fit of sobbing.
