</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2616');"><p>Toward the end of September Count Muffat, who was to dine at Nana's that evening, came at nightfall to inform her of a summons to the Tuileries. The lamps in the house had not been lit yet, and the servants were laughing uproariously in the kitchen regions as he softly mounted the stairs, where the tall windows gleamed in warm shadow. The door of the drawing room up-stairs opened noiselessly. A faint pink glow was dying out on the ceiling of the room, and the red hangings, the deep divans, the lacquered furniture, with their medley of embroidered fabrics and bronzes and china, were already sleeping under a slowly creeping flood of shadows, which drowned nooks and corners and blotted out the gleam of ivory and the glint of gold. And there in the darkness, on the white surface of a wide, outspread petticoat, which alone remained clearly visible, he saw Nana lying stretched in the arms of Georges. Denial in any shape or form was impossible. He gave a choking cry and stood gaping at them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2616" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>临近九月底了。一天，缪法伯爵约定要到娜娜家里吃晚饭，可是他在黄昏时分就来了，他来告诉娜娜，他突然接到一项命令，要他到杜伊勒里宫去。公馆里还未点灯，仆人们在厨房里吵吵嚷嚷，说说笑笑。伯爵悄悄地上了楼梯，屋子里又黑又闷热，楼梯上的彩绘玻璃闪烁着。到了楼上，他悄悄推开客厅的门。映在天花板上的一道淡红色的阳光渐渐暗淡下去；红色的帷幔、宽大的坐榻、油漆家具、杂乱无章的刺绣、铜器和瓷器，都在黑暗中沉睡了。黑暗犹如绵绵细雨在淹没着每一个角落，牙雕不再闪光，金饰不再生辉。黑暗中，只有一件白色的东西看得清楚，那是一条舒展开来的宽大裙子，他还瞥见娜娜躺在乔治的怀里。这是无法抵赖的事实。他想叫喊，但终未喊出声来，呆呆地愣在那里。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2617');"><p>Nana had bounded up, and now she pushed him into the bedroom in order to give the lad time to escape.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2617" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜一跃而起，把缪法推进卧室，好让小伙子趁机逃走。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2618');"><p>"Come in," she murmured with reeling senses, "I'll explain."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2618" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“进来吧，”她吓得晕头转向，低声说道，“我马上向你说清楚……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2619');"><p>She was exasperated at being thus surprised. Never before had she given way like this in her own house, in her own drawing room, when the doors were open. It was a long story: Georges and she had had a disagreement; he had been mad with jealousy of Philippe, and he had sobbed so bitterly on her bosom that she had yielded to him, not knowing how else to calm him and really very full of pity for him at heart. And on this solitary occasion, when she had been stupid enough to forget herself thus with a little rascal who could not even now bring her bouquets of violets, so short did his mother keep him—on this solitary occasion the count turned up and came straight down on them. 'Gad, she had very bad luck! That was what one got if one was a good-natured wench!
</p></origin><translate id="div_2619" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这样被缪法当场看见，她很恼怒。她从来没在自家客厅里，敞着门，干出这样荒唐的事。这次是因为发生了一件事，乔治因为嫉妒菲利普，盛怒之下同她吵了嘴，事后又搂着她的脖子，呜呜咽咽，他是那样伤心，她不知道怎样安慰他，她很怜悯他，于是就依从了他。只有这一回，她糊里糊涂地竟同一个小孩子干了这样的蠢事，其实他被母亲管得很严，连买紫罗兰送给她也不能，不料伯爵来了，正好撞见。真倒霉！想做个好心人，却得到这样的结果！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2620');"><p>Meanwhile in the bedroom, into which she had pushed Muffat, the darkness was complete. Whereupon after some groping she rang furiously and asked for a lamp. It was Julien's fault too! If there had been a lamp in the drawing room the whole affair would not have happened. It was the stupid nightfall which had got the better of her heart.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2620" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她把伯爵推进去的那间卧室，里面黑咕隆咚的，她摸索着找到了呼唤铃，气冲冲地按了按，叫人送灯来。这事全怪朱利安！如果客厅里有盏灯，就一点事儿也不会发生，黑夜这个怪物的降临，才使她动了春心。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2621');"><p>"I beseech you to be reasonable, my pet," she said when Zoe had brought in the lights.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2621" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我求求你，我的宝贝，理智一点。”佐爱把灯送来后，她说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2622');"><p>The count, with his hands on his knees, was sitting gazing at the floor. He was stupefied by what he had just seen. He did not cry out in anger. He only trembled, as though overtaken by some horror which was freezing him. This dumb misery touched the young woman, and she tried to comfort him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2622" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵坐在那儿，双手放在膝盖上，眼睛瞅着地板，呆呆地想着刚才见到的情景。他并没有气得大喊大叫，只浑身哆嗦着，好像看到了什么可怕的东西，吓得浑身都凉了。他虽痛苦，却一声不吭，娜娜深受感动，于是，她竭力安慰他： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2623');"><p>"Well, yes, I've done wrong. It's very bad what I did. You see I'm sorry for my fault. It makes me grieve very much because it annoys you. Come now, be nice, too, and forgive me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2623" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好了，是我错了……我做得很不对，你看，我已经懊悔了。这件事搞得你很不痛快，其实我心里也很难受……算了吧，你气量大一点，原谅我吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2624');"><p>She had crouched down at his feet and was striving to catch his eye with a look of tender submission. She was fain to know whether he was very vexed with her. Presently, as he gave a long sigh and seemed to recover himself, she grew more coaxing and with grave kindness of manner added a final reason:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2624" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她蹲在他的脚下，露出一副温顺的神态，搜索着他的目光，想看看他是否还在恨她。过了一会儿，他长长地叹了口气，慢慢平静下来，这时她做出一副更加娇媚可爱的样子，用庄重而善良的口气对他讲了最后一条理由： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2625');"><p>"You see, dearie, you must try and understand how it is: I can't refuse it to my poor friends."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2625" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“懂得吧，亲爱的，人与人要互相理解……我不能拒绝我那些穷朋友。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2626');"><p>The count consented to give way and only insisted that Georges should be dismissed once for all. But all his illusions had vanished, and he no longer believed in her sworn fidelity. Next day Nana would deceive him anew, and he only remained her miserable possessor in obedience to a cowardly necessity and to terror at the thought of living without her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2626" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵被她说得软了心，只要求把乔治打发走。可是现在一切幻想都已破灭了，娜娜发誓如何忠于他的那些话，他再也不相信了。过一天，娜娜还会欺骗他的；他所以要维持这种痛苦的爱情，只是出于一种怯懦的需要，出于一种对生活的恐惧，因为他一想到没有她，自己就无法活下去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2627');"><p>This was the epoch in her existence when Nana flared upon Paris with redoubled splendor. She loomed larger than heretofore on the horizon of vice and swayed the town with her impudently flaunted splendor and that contempt of money which made her openly squander fortunes. Her house had become a sort of glowing smithy, where her continual desires were the flames and the slightest breath from her lips changed gold into fine ashes, which the wind hourly swept away. Never had eye beheld such a rage of expenditure. The great house seemed to have been built over a gulf in which men—their worldly possessions, their fortunes, their very names—were swallowed up without leaving even a handful of dust behind them. This courtesan, who had the tastes of a parrot and gobbled up radishes and burnt almonds and pecked at the meat upon her plate, had monthly table bills amounting to five thousand francs. The wildest waste went on in the kitchen: the place, metaphorically speaking was one great river which stove in cask upon cask of wine and swept great bills with it, swollen by three or four successive manipulators. Victorine and Francois reigned supreme in the kitchen, whither they invited friends. In addition to these there was quite a little tribe of cousins, who were cockered up in their homes with cold meats and strong soup. Julien made the trades-people give him commissions, and the glaziers never put up a pane of glass at a cost of a franc and a half but he had a franc put down to himself. Charles devoured the horses' oats and doubled the amount of their provender, reselling at the back door what came in at the carriage gate, while amid the general pillage, the sack of the town after the storm, Zoe, by dint of cleverness, succeeded in saving appearances and covering the thefts of all in order the better to slur over and make good her own. But the household waste was worse than the household dishonesty. Yesterday's food was thrown into the gutter, and the collection of provisions in the house was such that the servants grew disgusted with it. The glass was all sticky with sugar, and the gas burners flared and flared till the rooms seemed ready to explode. Then, too, there were instances of negligence and mischief and sheer accident—of everything, in fact, which can hasten the ruin of a house devoured by so many mouths. Upstairs in Madame's quarters destruction raged more fiercely still. Dresses, which cost ten thousand francs and had been twice worn, were sold by Zoe; jewels vanished as though they had crumbled deep down in their drawers; stupid purchases were made; every novelty of the day was brought and left to lie forgotten in some corner the morning after or swept up by ragpickers in the street. She could not see any very expensive object without wanting to possess it, and so she constantly surrounded herself with the wrecks of bouquets and costly knickknacks and was the happier the more her passing fancy cost. Nothing remained intact in her hands; she broke everything, and this object withered, and that grew dirty in the clasp of her lithe white fingers. A perfect heap of nameless debris, of twisted shreds and muddy rags, followed her and marked her passage. Then amid this utter squandering of pocket money cropped up a question about the big bills and their settlement. Twenty thousand francs were due to the modiste, thirty thousand to the linen draper, twelve thousand to the bootmaker. Her stable devoured fifty thousand for her, and in six months she ran up a bill of a hundred and twenty thousand francs at her ladies' tailor. Though she had not enlarged her scheme of expenditure, which Labordette reckoned at four hundred thousand francs on an average, she ran up that same year to a million. She was herself stupefied by the amount and was unable to tell whither such a sum could have gone. Heaps upon heaps of men, barrowfuls of gold, failed to stop up the hole, which, amid this ruinous luxury, continually gaped under the floor of her house.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2627" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>现在是娜娜一生中的黄金时代，她的名字在巴黎无人不知，她在罪孽中不断壮大，她挥金如土，大肆炫耀她的奢侈生活，她公然把一笔笔财富化为乌有，她这样征服了整个巴黎。在她的公馆里，仿佛有一座火光熊熊的熔炉。她无穷尽的欲望就像炉中的烈焰，她的嘴唇轻轻一吹，就把黄金顿时化成灰烬，随时被风席卷而去。如此疯狂地挥霍金钱，确实罕见。这座公馆仿佛建在一个深渊上，那些男人连同他们的财产、他们的身躯，乃至他们的姓氏都在这里被吞噬了，连一点粉末的痕迹都没留下。这个娼妇有着鹦鹉的嗜好，喜欢吃红皮白萝卜和糖衣杏仁，喜欢一点一点地吃肉，每个月花在吃上的费用就达五千法郎。厨房里的浪费令人吃惊，东西流失严重，一桶桶酒被打开喝了，一张张帐单经过三四个人的手就增加了几倍。维克托里娜和弗朗索瓦像主人一样在厨房里指挥一切，他们除了把冷肉和浓场送给亲戚在家吃喝外，还经常请一些人到厨房里吃饭。朱利安总是向供应商索取回扣，装玻璃的人每装一块价值三十苏的玻璃，他就叫多支出二十个苏，这二十个苏就落进他的腰包。夏尔则吞吃喂马的燕麦，把买进的东西虚报一倍，把从前门买进来的东西，又从后门卖出去。在这普遍的浪费风气中，如同攻克一座城市后进行洗劫一样，佐爱的手段最高明，她为了保全别人的面子，对每个人的盗窃行为睁一眼闭一眼，以便混水摸鱼，达到掩盖自己盗窃行为的目的。但是最糟糕的还是浪费，隔夜的饭菜都被扔到路边，食物堆积很多，仆人们都吃得倒了胃口，玻璃杯上粘了糖，煤气灯日夜不灭，把墙壁都烤裂了；还有粗枝大叶、蓄意破坏和意外事故造成的损失，所有这一切都加速了这个被那么多张嘴吞噬的家庭的毁灭。另外，在楼上，太太那里毁灭之势就更加明显。许多价值一万法郎的裙子，主人只穿过两次，就被佐爱拿出去卖了；一些珠宝首饰不翼而飞，像在抽屉里化成了粉末；东西胡乱买，当天买来的新东西，第二天就被人丢在角落里，扫到街上。她见到一样价值昂贵的东西，没有不想买的，因此，她的周围经常有些残花和破碎的小玩意，她一时心血来潮买来的东西，价钱越贵她就越高兴。任何东西到了她的手里总要弄坏；她什么东西都打坏，凡是被她那洁白小手指碰过的东西不是褪了色，就是弄脏了；凡是她走过的地方，都要留下一大片说不出名字的碎屑、弄皱的碎布片和粘满污泥的布条。另外，在零花钱方面，由于随便买东西，经常出现大笔帐款需要支付：欠帽子店二万法郎，欠洗衣店三万法郎，欠鞋店一万二千法郎；她的马厩花掉她五万法郎；六个月内，她就欠下裁缝店十二万法郎。据拉博德特估计，她每年家庭开支平均达四十万法郎。这一年她并未增加开支项目，却花了一百万，这个数字把她吓呆了，她自己也说不出这些钱用到何处了。到公馆来的男人一批未走，又来一批，满车金子倒下来也填不满这个无底洞，这个洞在她公馆的地砖下面，在她的豪华生活的爆裂声中不断下陷着。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2628');"><p>Meanwhile Nana had cherished her latest caprice. Once more exercised by the notion that her room needed redoing, she fancied she had hit on something at last. The room should be done in velvet of the color of tea roses, with silver buttons and golden cords, tassels and fringes, and the hangings should be caught up to the ceiling after the manner of a tent. This arrangement ought to be both rich and tender, she thought, and would form a splendid background to her blonde vermeil-tinted skin. However, the bedroom was only designed to serve as a setting to the bed, which was to be a dazzling affair, a prodigy. Nana meditated a bed such as had never before existed; it was to be a throne, an altar, whither Paris was to come in order to adore her sovereign nudity. It was to be all in gold and silver beaten work—it should suggest a great piece of jewelry with its golden roses climbing on a trelliswork of silver. On the headboard a band of Loves should peep forth laughing from amid the flowers, as though they were watching the voluptuous dalliance within the shadow of the bed curtains. Nana had applied to Labordette who had brought two goldsmiths to see her. They were already busy with the designs. The bed would cost fifty thousand francs, and Muffat was to give it her as a New Year's present.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2628" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而，娜娜最近又一次心血来潮，她绞尽脑汁，想把卧室重新装饰一下，怎样装饰她已经考虑好了：卧室的墙上全部装挂上茶红色天鹅绒，上面装饰上小巧玲珑的银色边缝，这样的装饰一直延伸到天花板上，使卧室像帐篷一样，再用金线细绳和金丝流苏作配饰。她觉得这样的布置既豪华又雅致，这样的绝妙背景可衬托出她的白里透红的皮肤。不过，卧室是用来放床的，因此床就应该是奇妙的、令人眼花缭乱的东西。娜娜幻想有一张人们从来没有见过的床，它既像国王的宝座，又像神坛，使巴黎的人都到她的床前来膜拜她那至高无上的裸体。这张床将全部用金子和银子镶嵌而成，看上去颇像一件巨大的首饰，银制的框架上点缀上若干金制的玫瑰花，床头放一些鲜花，鲜花丛中放一群小爱神，笑吟吟地探着身子，在幽暗中窥视着淫乐行为。她把这个计划对拉博德特说了，他给她找来了两个金银匠。他们已经着手画图。这张床要花五万法郎，缪法把这张床作为礼物馈赠她。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2629');"><p>What most astonished the young woman was that she was endlessly short of money amid a river of gold, the tide of which almost enveloped her. On certain days she was at her wit's end for want of ridiculously small sums—sums of only a few louis. She was driven to borrow from Zoe, or she scraped up cash as well as she could on her own account. But before resignedly adopting extreme measures she tried her friends and in a joking sort of way got the men to give her all they had about them, even down to their coppers. For the last three months she had been emptying Philippe's pockets especially, and now on days of passionate enjoyment he never came away but he left his purse behind him. Soon she grew bolder and asked him for loans of two hundred francs, three hundred francs—never more than that—wherewith to pay the interest of bills or to stave off outrageous debts. And Philippe, who in July had been appointed paymaster to his regiment, would bring the money the day after, apologizing at the same time for not being rich, seeing that good Mamma Hugon now treated her sons with singular financial severity. At the close of three months these little oft-renewed loans mounted up to a sum of ten thousand francs. The captain still laughed his hearty-sounding laugh, but he was growing visibly thinner, and sometimes he seemed absent-minded, and a shade of suffering would pass over his face. But one look from Nana's eyes would transfigure him in a sort of sensual ecstasy. She had a very coaxing way with him and would intoxicate him with furtive kisses and yield herself to him in sudden fits of self-abandonment, which tied him to her apron strings the moment he was able to escape from his military duties.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2629" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这位少妇感到惊讶的是，在这条流着黄金的河流中，她的四肢都被它的波涛淹没了，而她竟然还时常感到手头拮据。有些日子，她竟然为了微不足道的几个金路易被弄得焦头烂额，最后不得不向佐爱借，或自己想方设法去弄。不过，在她采取不得已的办法之前，她总是用开玩笑的样子，向朋友们试探要钱，她总是把男人们身上的钱掏得精光，连一个子儿也不剩。三个月来，被她搜刮一空的主要是菲利普。在她经济拮据时，菲利普每次来了，都得把钱包留下来。时隔不久，她胆子更大了，竟然向他借钱，每次借两百法郎，或三百法郎，但是从未超过这样的数目，她用借来的钱去支付借据或偿还逼得很紧的债务；菲利普于七月份已被任命为上尉司库，每次娜娜向他借钱，他总是第二天就带来，并表示歉意，说他经济并不宽裕，因为于贡老太太现在对儿子管得很严。三个月后，这些小额借款，经常到期不还，积累起来，已有一万法郎左右。上尉依然笑得那么爽朗。不过，他日渐消瘦，有时心绪不宁，脸上浮现出愁苦的阴影。但是，只要娜娜看他一眼，他就顿时春心似火，眉飞色舞。她对他很温情，经常在门后吻他，把他弄得神魂颠倒，有时她突然向他调情，把他缠住，只要他走出兵营，他就寸步不离地跟着她转。

Captain Philippe brought his himself; it was an old comfit dish in Dresden china, and it had a gold mount. He found her alone in her dressing room. She had just emerged from the bath, had nothing on save a great red-and-white flannel bathing wrap and was very busy examining her presents, which were ranged on a table. She had already broken a rock-crystal flask in her attempts to unstopper it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2630" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一天晚上，娜娜说她的教名叫泰雷兹，她的圣名瞻礼日是十月十五日。每个男人都给她送了礼物。菲利普上尉送来的礼物是一个安放在金底座上的古老的萨克斯瓷器糖果盒。他来到时，见她一个人在梳洗室里，刚刚洗完澡，身上只穿一件红白两色的法兰绒宽大浴衣，正在仔细观看那些摆在桌子上的礼物。她打开一只天然水晶瓶子的塞子时，打坏了那个瓶子。

</p></origin><translate id="div_2635" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎！打碎了！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2636');"><p>Then she burst out laughing. The fragments lying on the floor tickled her fancy. Her merriment was of the nervous kind, the stupid, spiteful laughter of a child who delights in destruction.

</p></origin><translate id="div_2636" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，她笑起来。在她看来，地上的碎片很有趣。那是一种神经质般的笑，傻笑，就像一个淘气的孩子，打碎了东西，反而觉得好玩。开始菲利普生气了，这个可恶的女人，不知道他烦了多少神才弄到这个小玩艺。她见他变了脸色，就竭力忍住笑。

</p></origin><translate id="div_2639" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>年轻人虽然竭力克制自己，眸子里还是流出了泪水，于是她就向他扑过去，温情地搂住他的脖子，说道：

</p></origin><translate id="div_2640" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你真傻！我还是爱你的。如果什么东西都不打坏，商人就不要卖东西了。这些东西造出来就是让人打坏的……瞧！这把扇子不就是用胶水粘起来的吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2641');"><p>She had snatched up a fan and was dragging at the blades so that the silk was torn in two. This seemed to excite her, and in order to show that she scorned the other presents, the moment she had ruined his she treated herself to a general massacre, rapping each successive object and proving clearly that not one was solid in that she had broken them all. There was a lurid glow in her vacant eyes, and her lips, slightly drawn back, displayed her white teeth. Soon, when everything was in fragments, she laughed cheerily again and with flushed cheeks beat on the table with the flat of her hands, lisping like a naughty little girl:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2641" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她拿起一把扇子，把扇骨一拉，上面的绸布被撕成两块。似乎这样她就高兴了。她刚才打碎了他的礼物，为了表示她把其它礼物也不看在眼里，就干脆好好过过瘾，她就来了一场大破坏，她把所有礼物都打坏，以此来证明没有一样东西是结实的。她冷漠的眼睛里炯炯发光，嘴唇微微翘起，露出了洁白的牙齿。一切都被她打成碎片后，她的脸上泛起了红晕，又笑起来，张开手掌拍着桌子，然后学着淘气孩子的声音，吐字不清地说道：

Francois had certainly seen him pass, but the servants had now got to laugh among themselves at their good lady's embarrassing situations. He had just slipped as far as the little drawing room when his brother's voice stopped him, and, as one powerless to tear himself from the door, he overheard everything that went on within, the kisses, the offer of marriage. A feeling of horror froze him, and he went away in a state bordering on imbecility, feeling as though there were a great void in his brain. It was only in his own room above his mother's flat in the Rue Richelieu that his heart broke in a storm of furious sobs. This time there could be no doubt about the state of things; a horrible picture of Nana in Philippe's arms kept rising before his mind's eye. It struck him in the light of an incest. When he fancied himself calm again the remembrance of it all would return, and in fresh access of raging jealousy he would throw himself on the bed, biting the coverlet, shouting infamous accusations which maddened him the more. Thus the day passed. In order to stay shut up in his room he spoke of having a sick headache. But the night proved more terrible still; a murder fever shook him amid continual nightmares. Had his brother lived in the house, he would have gone and killed him with the stab of a knife. When day returned he tried to reason things out. It was he who ought to die, and he determined to throw himself out of the window when an omnibus was passing. Nevertheless, he went out toward ten o'clock and traversed Paris, wandered up and down on the bridges and at the last moment felt an unconquerable desire to see Nana once more. With one word, perhaps, she would save him. And three o'clock was striking when he entered the house in the Avenue de Villiers.

Philippe had been in prison since the evening of the previous day, accused of having stolen twelve thousand francs from the chest of his regiment. For the last three months he had been withdrawing small sums therefrom in the hope of being able to repay them, while he had covered the deficit with false money. Thanks to the negligence of the administrative committee, this fraud had been constantly successful. The old lady, humbled utterly by her child's crime, had at once cried out in anger against Nana. She knew Philippe's connection with her, and her melancholy had been the result of this miserable state of things which kept her in Paris in constant dread of some final catastrophe. But she had never looked forward to such shame as this, and now she blamed herself for refusing him money, as though such refusal had made her accessory to his act. She sank down on an armchair; her legs were seized with paralysis, and she felt herself to be useless, incapable of action and destined to stay where she was till she died. But the sudden thought of Georges comforted her. Georges was still left her; he would be able to act, perhaps to save them. Thereupon, without seeking aid of anyone else—for she wished to keep these matters shrouded in the bosom of her family—she dragged herself up to the next story, her mind possessed by the idea that she still had someone to love about her. But upstairs she found an empty room. The porter told her that M. Georges had gone out at an early hour. The room was haunted by the ghost of yet another calamity; the bed with its gnawed bedclothes bore witness to someone's anguish, and a chair which lay amid a heap of clothes on the ground looked like something dead. Georges must be at that woman's house, and so with dry eyes and feet that had regained their strength Mme Hugon went downstairs. She wanted her sons; she was starting to reclaim them.

It was a wretched story. He had supplied her with bread to the amount of a hundred and thirty-three francs, and despite her royal housekeeping she could not pay it. In his irritation at being put off he had presented himself a score of times since the day he had refused further credit, and the servants were now espousing his cause. Francois kept saying that Madame would never pay him unless he made a fine scene; Charles talked of going upstairs, too, in order to get an old unpaid straw bill settled, while Victorine advised them to wait till some gentleman was with her, when they would get the money out of her by suddenly asking for it in the middle of conversation. The kitchen was in a savage mood: the tradesmen were all kept posted in the course events were taking, and there were gossiping consultations, lasting three or four hours on a stretch, during which Madame was stripped, plucked and talked over with the wrathful eagerness peculiar to an idle, overprosperous servants' hall. Julien, the house steward, alone pretended to defend his mistress. She was quite the thing, whatever they might say! And when the others accused him of sleeping with her he laughed fatuously, thereby driving the cook to distraction, for she would have liked to be a man in order to "spit on such women's backsides," so utterly would they have disgusted her. Francois, without informing Madame of it, had wickedly posted the baker in the hall, and when she came downstairs at lunch time she found herself face to face with him. Taking the bill, she told him to return toward three o'clock, whereupon, with many foul expressions, he departed, vowing that he would have things properly settled and get his money by hook or by crook.

A dozen times she had put his money aside for him, but it had as constantly melted away, sometimes in the purchase of flowers, at others in the shape of a subscription got up for the benefit of an old gendarme. Besides, she was counting on Philippe and was astonished not to see him make his appearance with his two hundred francs. It was regular bad luck, seeing that the day before yesterday she had again given Satin an outfit, a perfect trousseau this time, some twelve hundred francs' worth of dresses and linen, and now she had not a louis remaining.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2657');"><p>"You see," he said, "this is the body of the bed. In the middle here there's a bunch of roses in full bloom, and then comes a garland of buds and flowers. The leaves are to be in yellow and the roses in red-gold.

However, a difficulty presented itself. Labordette showed her two designs for the footboard, one of which reproduced the pattern on the sides, while the other, a subject by itself, represented Night wrapped in her veil and discovered by a faun in all her splendid nudity. He added that if she chose this last subject the goldsmiths intended making Night in her own likeness. This idea, the taste of which was rather risky, made her grow white with pleasure, and she pictured herself as a silver statuette, symbolic of the warm, voluptuous delights of darkness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2660" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的自豪感得到了极大的满足。金银匠说过，没有一个王后睡过这样的床。不过，这里有一个复杂的问题。拉博德特让她看两幅床腿图，其中一幅是仿船形床的床腿图案，另一幅则是人形图案，一个裹着薄纱的夜女神，被一个人身羊足的农牧神揭去了薄纱，露出了光艳照人的裸体。他又补充说，如果选择后一幅图案，金银匠就打算把夜女神制作得同她一样。这样大胆的构思，她听后高兴得脸都发白了，她仿佛看见自己被塑成银雕像，象征着温和、欢乐的黑夜。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2675');"><p>She refused; it was useless. Two days before she had succeeded in getting five thousand francs out of the count. However, she soon regretted her discreet conduct, for the moment Labordette had gone the baker reappeared, though it was barely half-past two, and with many loud oaths roughly settled himself on a bench in the hall. The young woman listened to him from the first floor. She was pale, and it caused her especial pain to hear the servants' secret rejoicings swelling up louder and louder till they even reached her ears. Down in the kitchen they were dying of laughter. The coachman was staring across from the other side of the court; Francois was crossing the hall without any apparent reason. Then he hurried off to report progress, after sneering knowingly at the baker. They didn't care a damn for Madame; the walls were echoing to their laughter, and she felt that she was deserted on all hands and despised by the servants' hall, the inmates of which were watching her every movement and liberally bespattering her with the filthiest of chaff. Thereupon she abandoned the intention of borrowing the hundred and thirty-three francs from Zoe; she already owed the maid money, and she was too proud to risk a refusal now. Such a burst of feeling stirred her that she went back into her room, loudly remarking:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2675" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她叫他不要去，去也没有用。因为两天前，她从伯爵那里拿了五千法郎。不过，她又后悔自己太谨慎了。拉博德特走后，虽然才到二点半钟，面包商又来了。他猛然坐到前厅的一条长凳上，大声咒骂起来。娜娜在二楼听到骂声，气得脸色发白，尤其令她难过的是，仆人们都在暗暗高兴，他们的谈笑声越来越大，一直飘进她的耳里。他们在厨房里笑得要命；车夫在院子深处向里面张望，弗朗索瓦无缘无故穿过前厅，对着面包商会心地笑了，随后赶紧去向其他仆人报告消息。大伙都瞧不起太太，他们的笑声简直把墙壁都震动了。娜娜感到很孤单，连仆人们也鄙视她，他们窥伺着她的举动，用下流的嘲讽语言侮辱她。她本来想向佐爱借一百三十三法郎，现在放弃了这个念头，她已经欠了佐爱的钱，她太自负了，不想去冒遭到拒绝的危险。这时她是那样激动，便回到了卧室，大声说道：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2676');"><p>"Come, come, my girl, don't count on anyone but yourself. Your body's your own property, and it's better to make use of it than to let yourself be insulted."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2677');"><p>And without even summoning Zoe she dressed herself with feverish haste in order to run round to the Tricon's. In hours of great embarrassment this was her last resource. Much sought after and constantly solicited by the old lady, she would refuse or resign herself according to her needs, and on these increasingly frequent occasions when both ends would not meet in her royally conducted establishment, she was sure to find twenty-five louis awaiting her at the other's house. She used to betake herself to the Tricon's with the ease born of use, just as the poor go to the pawnshop.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2677" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她连佐爱也没有叫，就急急忙忙穿衣服，准备到拉特里贡家里去。这是她每次陷入困境时的最后法宝。她是抢手货，老虔婆拉特里贡经常来求她，她根据自己的需要，有时拒绝，有时答应；她那豪华的生活排场，收支上经常出现亏空，这样的日子越来越多，她只要到老虔婆那里去，肯定可以弄到二十五个金路易。去找拉特里贡，她已习以为常了，就像穷人进当铺一样。

Her last words rang like the knell of a tocsin in his ears: "It's over, quite over!" And he thought the ground was opening beneath his feet. There was a void in his brain from which the man awaiting Nana had disappeared. Philippe alone remained there in the young woman's bare embrace forever and ever. She did not deny it: she loved him, since she wanted to spare him the pain of her infidelity. It was over, quite over. He breathed heavily and gazed round the room, suffocating beneath a crushing weight. Memories kept recurring to him one after the other—memories of merry nights at La Mignotte, of amorous hours during which he had fancied himself her child, of pleasures stolen in this very room. And now these things would never, never recur! He was too small; he had not grown up quickly enough; Philippe was supplanting him because he was a bearded man. So then this was the end; he could not go on living. His vicious passion had become transformed into an infinite tenderness, a sensual adoration, in which his whole being was merged. Then, too, how was he to forget it all if his brother remained—his brother, blood of his blood, a second self, whose enjoyment drove him mad with jealousy? It was the end of all things; he wanted to die.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2706" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>随后，她扔下他走了。他伫立在客厅中央。她的最后几句话像警钟一样在他的耳边回响：完了，完全完了；他觉得脚下的地裂开了。他脑子里空空的，刚才等待娜娜的那个男人消失了；只有菲利普还留在娜娜赤裸的怀抱里。她不否认自己爱菲利普，她不愿让菲利普知道她对他不忠，免得让他伤心。完了，完全完了。他深深地吸了口气，扫视房间一下，好像有一个重重的东西压得他喘不过气来。往事一幕幕在他的脑海里浮现，在“藏娇楼”里度过的那些欢乐的夜晚，她抚摸他的时候，他觉得自己就是她的孩子，还有在这房间里的偷情欢乐。这一切不再有了，一去不复返了！他太年轻，他没有很快长大；菲利普取代了他，因为他有胡子。啊！完了，他不能活下去了。他的淫乐充满了无限柔情，充满性爱，他的整个身心都陷进去了。再说，他的哥哥仍然与她相好，他怎么能够忘掉呢？他是自己的同胞兄弟，他的淫乐使他嫉妒得发狂。完了，他不想再活了。

Downstairs on the bench in the hall the baker was laughing with Charles and Francois. Zoe came running across the drawing room and seemed surprised at sight of Georges. She asked him if he were waiting for Madame. Yes, he was waiting for her; he had for-gotten to give her an answer to a question. And when he was alone he set to work and searched. Finding nothing else to suit his purpose, he took up in the dressing room a pair of very sharply pointed scissors with which Nana had a mania for ceaselessly trimming herself, either by polishing her skin or cutting off little hairs. Then for a whole hour he waited patiently, his hand in his pocket and his fingers tightly clasped round the scissors.

There was scarcely any bleeding—only a little blood, a tiny stain which was oozing down into his waistcoat. She was making up her mind to step over the body when an apparition sent her starting back. An old lady was advancing through the drawing-room door, which remained wide open opposite. And in her terror she recognized Mme Hugon but could not explain her presence. Still wearing her gloves and hat, Nana kept edging backward, and her terror grew so great that she sought to defend herself, and in a shaky voice:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2720" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的样子真叫她害怕。他脸色煞白，双目紧闭。几乎没有流血，只有一点点血，消失在背心下面。她决定从他身上跨过去，这时来了一个人，吓得她直往后退。在她面前，从客厅敞开的门走进来一位老太太。她认出那是于贡太太。老太太惊恐万状，没有说出自己的来意。娜娜仍然往后退着，手套和帽子都未来得及脱掉。她吓得要命，结结巴巴地为自己辩护道：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2721');"><p>"Madame," she cried, "it isn't I; I swear to you it isn't. He wanted to marry me, and I said no, and he's killed himself!"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2722');"><p>Slowly Mme Hugon drew near—she was in black, and her face showed pale under her white hair. In the carriage, as she drove thither, the thought of Georges had vanished and that of Philippe's misdoing had again taken complete possession of her. It might be that this woman could afford explanations to the judges which would touch them, and so she conceived the project of begging her to bear witness in her son's favor. Downstairs the doors of the house stood open, but as she mounted to the first floor her sick feet failed her, and she was hesitating as to which way to go when suddenly horror-stricken cries directed her. Then upstairs she found a man lying on the floor with bloodstained shirt. It was Georges—it was her other child.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2722" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于贡太太身穿黑袍，面色苍白，满头银发，慢慢走过来。她坐上马车后，已经不想乔治了，菲利普的错误一直在她的脑海里盘旋。她想娜娜也许能去向法官们求求情，使他们感动。所以她想来央求娜娜，让她去向法官作些有利于儿子的证明。她见公馆楼下的门都开着，她就进来了，走到楼梯边，因为腿有毛病，她迟疑了一会。正在这时候，突然听见可怕的叫声，她就向着发出声音的方向走去。到了楼上，只见一个人躺在地上，衬衫上有血迹，他是乔治，是他的另一个儿子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2723');"><p>Nana, in idiotic tones, kept saying:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2725');"><p>Uttering no cry, Mme Hugon stooped down. Yes, it was the other one; it was Georges. The one was brought to dishonor, the other murdered! It caused her no surprise, for her whole life was ruined. Kneeling on the carpet, utterly forgetting where she was, noticing no one else, she gazed fixedly at her boy's face and listened with her hand on his heart. Then she gave a feeble sigh—she had felt the heart beating. And with that she lifted her head and scrutinized the room and the woman and seemed to remember. A fire glowed forth in her vacant eyes, and she looked so great and terrible in her silence that Nana trembled as she continued to defend herself above the body that divided them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2725" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于贡太太没哭叫一声，她弯下腰来。一点不错，那是她的另一个儿子乔治。一个儿子丢尽了脸，另一个儿子自杀了。她并不感到突然，她的一生完了。她跪在地毯上，不知道置身何处，也不看任何人，眼睛只注视着乔治的脸。她把一只手放在儿子的胸口，听听心脏的声音。她感到儿子的心脏还在跳动，便轻轻舒了口气。这时她抬起头，仔细瞧着这间房子和这个女人，似乎现在才回忆起什么来。顿时，她那茫然若失的眼睛炯炯发亮，她一声不吭，显得那样高大，那样可怕，吓得娜娜浑身颤抖。她隔着乔治的身体，继续为自己辩护：

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2728');"><p>Nana felt a choking sensation. Why, what was the reason of it all? The other had turned thief now! They were mad in that family! She ceased struggling in self-defense; she seemed no longer mistress in her own house and allowed Mme Hugon to give what orders she liked. The servants had at last hurried up, and the old lady insisted on their carrying the fainting Georges down to her carriage. She preferred killing him rather than letting him remain in that house. With an air of stupefaction Nana watched the retreating servants as they supported poor, dear Zizi by his legs and shoulders. The mother walked behind them in a state of collapse; she supported herself against the furniture; she felt as if all she held dear had vanished in the void. On the landing a sob escaped her; she turned and twice ejaculated:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2728" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>顿时娜娜透不过气来。究竟为什么发生这些事呢？现在另一个居然又贪污了公款！难道这家人都成了疯子！她不再为自己辩护，仿佛不是在自己家里，只能听凭于贡太太发号施令。几个仆人终于跑过来了，老太太硬要他们把昏迷的乔治抬下楼，放到她的马车里。她宁愿把他杀死，从这座房子里运走，也不让他留下来。娜娜用惊愕的目光瞧着仆人们抬着可怜的治治，他们有的抓肩膀，有的抓腿。母亲跟在后面，现在她已精疲力竭，扶着家具往前走，仿佛她所爱的一切都化为泡影。到了楼梯口，她呜咽起来，回过头，连说两次： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2729');"><p>"Oh, but you've done us infinite harm! You've done us infinite harm!"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2730');"><p>That was all. In her stupefaction Nana had sat down; she still wore her gloves and her hat. The house once more lapsed into heavy silence; the carriage had driven away, and she sat motionless, not knowing what to do next, her head swimming after all she had gone through. A quarter of an hour later Count Muffat found her thus, but at sight of him she relieved her feelings in an overflowing current of talk. She told him all about the sad incident, repeated the same details twenty times over, picked up the bloodstained scissors in order to imitate Zizi's gesture when he stabbed himself. And above all she nursed the idea of proving her own innocence.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2730" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她没有说别的。娜娜坐着发呆，依然戴着手套和帽子。马车离去了，公馆里又恢复了寂静；她一动不动，什么也不想，唯有乔治自杀的事还在她的头脑里嗡嗡作响。一刻钟后，缪法伯爵来了，发现她还呆在那里。不过，她见到伯爵后，舒了口气，滔滔不绝地对他讲述这件不幸事情的经过，三番五次地讲事情的细枝末节，还把染上血迹的剪刀拿起来，做治治自杀的动作，伯爵听后，心里惶惶不安。她心里想到的是要证明自己是无辜的。

For a moment or two, when in the cab which drove him to the Rue Richelieu, he had busily sworn never to return to that woman's house. Heaven was warning him; the misfortunes of Philippe and Georges were, he opined, prophetic of his proper ruin. But neither the sight of Mme Hugon in tears nor that of the boy burning with fever had been strong enough to make him keep his vow, and the short-lived horror of the situation had only left behind it a sense of secret delight at the thought that he was now well quit of a rival, the charm of whose youth had always exasperated him. His passion had by this time grown exclusive; it was, indeed, the passion of a man who has had no youth. He loved Nana as one who yearned to be her sole possessor, to listen to her, to touch her, to be breathed on by her. His was now a supersensual tenderness, verging on pure sentiment; it was an anxious affection and as such was jealous of the past and apt at times to dream of a day of redemption and pardon received, when both should kneel before God the Father. Every day religion kept regaining its influence over him. He again became a practicing Christian; he confessed himself and communicated, while a ceaseless struggle raged within him, and remorse redoubled the joys of sin and of repentance. Afterward, when his director gave him leave to spend his passion, he had made a habit of this daily perdition and would redeem the same by ecstasies of faith, which were full of pious humility. Very naively he offered heaven, by way of expiatory anguish, the abominable torment from which he was suffering. This torment grew and increased, and he would climb his Calvary with the deep and solemn feelings of a believer, though steeped in a harlot's fierce sensuality. That which made his agony most poignant was this woman's continued faithlessness. He could not share her with others, nor did he understand her imbecile caprices. Undying, unchanging love was what he wished for. However, she had sworn, and he paid her as having done so. But he felt that she was untruthful, incapable of common fidelity, apt to yield to friends, to stray passers-by, like a good-natured animal, born to live minus a shift.

For no reason whatever, at the slightest approach to a quarrel she would tell him he might stop or go as he liked, and she would accompany her permission with a flood of odious reflections. She said she could always find better than he; she had only too many from whom to choose; men in any quantity could be picked up in the street, and men a good deal smarter, too, whose blood boiled in their veins. At this he would hang his head and wait for those gentler moods when she wanted money. She would then become affectionate, and he would forget it all, one night of tender dalliance making up for the tortures of a whole week. His reconciliation with his wife had rendered his home unbearable. Fauchery, having again fallen under Rose's dominion, the countess was running madly after other loves. She was entering on the forties, that restless, feverish time in the life of women, and ever hysterically nervous, she now filled her mansion with the maddening whirl of her fashionable life. Estelle, since her marriage, had seen nothing of her father; the undeveloped, insignificant girl had suddenly become a woman of iron will, so imperious withal that Daguenet trembled in her presence. In these days he accompanied her to mass: he was converted, and he raged against his father-in-law for ruining them with a courtesan. M. Venot alone still remained kindly inclined toward the count, for he was biding his time. He had even succeeded in getting into Nana's immediate circle. In fact, he frequented both houses, where you encountered his continual smile behind doors. So Muffat, wretched at home, driven out by ennui and shame, still preferred to live in the Avenue de Villiers, even though he was abused there.

Was their reconciliation good for nothing then? She was sorry she had mixed herself up in it, since despite everything he was always at her heels. On the days when, out of anger, she forgot her own interest, she swore to play him such a dirty trick that he would never again be able to set foot in her place. But when she slapped her leg and yelled at him she might quite as well have spat in his face too: he would still have stayed and even thanked her. Then the rows about money matters kept continually recurring. She demanded money savagely; she rowed him over wretched little amounts; she was odiously stingy with every minute of her time; she kept fiercely informing him that she slept with him for his money, not for any other reasons, and that she did not enjoy it a bit, that, in fact, she loved another and was awfully unfortunate in needing an idiot of his sort! They did not even want him at court now, and there was some talk of requiring him to send in his resignation. The empress had said, "He is too disgusting." It was true enough.

Sometimes her landau, in its haste to get by, stopped a file of puissant turnouts, wherein sat plutocrats able to buy up all Europe or Cabinet ministers with plump fingers tight-pressed to the throat of France. She belonged to this Bois society, occupied a prominent place in it, was known in every capital and asked about by every foreigner. The splendors of this crowd were enhanced by the madness of her profligacy as though it were the very crown, the darling passion, of the nation. Then there were unions of a night, continual passages of desire, which she lost count of the morning after, and these sent her touring through the grand restaurants and on fine days, as often as not, to "Madrid." The staffs of all the embassies visited her, and she, Lucy Stewart, Caroline Hequet and Maria Blond would dine in the society of gentlemen who murdered the French language and paid to be amused, engaging them by the evening with orders to be funny and yet proving so blase and so worn out that they never even touched them.

However, he suffered not a little from the lesser indignities of their daily life. The mansion in the Avenue de Villiers was becoming a hell, a house full of mad people, in which every hour of the day wild disorders led to hateful complications. Nana even fought with her servants. One moment she would be very nice with Charles, the coachman. When she stopped at a restaurant she would send him out beer by the waiter and would talk with him from the inside of her carriage when he slanged the cabbies at a block in the traffic, for then he struck her as funny and cheered her up. Then the next moment she called him a fool for no earthly reason. She was always squabbling over the straw, the bran or the oats; in spite of her love for animals she thought her horses ate too much. Accordingly one day when she was settling up she accused the man of robbing her. At this Charles got in a rage and called her a whore right out; his horses, he said, were distinctly better than she was, for they did not sleep with everybody. She answered him in the same strain, and the count had to separate them and give the coachman the sack. This was the beginning of a rebellion among the servants. When her diamonds had been stolen Victorine and Francois left. Julien himself disappeared, and the tale ran that the master had given him a big bribe and had begged him to go, because he slept with the mistress. Every week there were new faces in the servants' hall. Never was there such a mess; the house was like a passage down which the scum of the registry offices galloped, destroying everything in their path. Zoe alone kept her place; she always looked clean, and her only anxiety was how to organize this riot until she had got enough together to set up on her own account in fulfillment of a plan she had been hatching for some time past.

The count put up with the stupidity of Mme Maloir, playing bezique with her in spite of her musty smell. He put up with Mme Lerat and her encumbrances, with Louiset and the mournful complaints peculiar to a child who is being eaten up with the rottenness inherited from some unknown father. But he spent hours worse than these. One evening he had heard Nana angrily telling her maid that a man pretending to be rich had just swindled her—a handsome man calling himself an American and owning gold mines in his own country, a beast who had gone off while she was asleep without giving her a copper and had even taken a packet of cigarette papers with him. The count had turned very pale and had gone downstairs again on tiptoe so as not to hear more. But later he had to hear all. Nana, having been smitten with a baritone in a music hall and having been thrown over by him, wanted to commit suicide during a fit of sentimental melancholia. She swallowed a glass of water in which she had soaked a box of matches. This made her terribly sick but did not kill her. The count had to nurse her and to listen to the whole story of her passion, her tearful protests and her oaths never to take to any man again. In her contempt for those swine, as she called them, she could not, however, keep her heart free, for she always had some sweetheart round her, and her exhausted body inclined to incomprehensible fancies and perverse tastes. As Zoe designedly relaxed her efforts the service of the house had got to such a pitch that Muffat did not dare to push open a door, to pull a curtain or to unclose a cupboard. The bells did not ring; men lounged about everywhere and at every moment knocked up against one another. He had now to cough before entering a room, having almost caught the girl hanging round Francis' neck one evening that he had just gone out of the dressing room for two minutes to tell the coachman to put the horses to, while her hairdresser was finishing her hair. She gave herself up suddenly behind his back; she took her pleasure in every corner, quickly, with the first man she met. Whether she was in her chemise or in full dress did not matter. She would come back to the count red all over, happy at having cheated him. As for him, he was plagued to death; it was an abominable infliction!

He would have willingly urged her on to this vice, to keep the men off her. But all was spoiled in this direction too. Nana deceived Satin as she deceived the count, going mad over some monstrous fancy or other and picking up girls at the street corners. Coming back in her carriage, she would suddenly be taken with a little slut that she saw on the pavement; her senses would be captivated, her imagination excited. She would take the little slut in with her, pay her and send her away again. Then, disguised as a man, she would go to infamous houses and look on at scenes of debauch to while away hours of boredom. And Satin, angry at being thrown over every moment, would turn the house topsy-turvy with the most awful scenes. She had at last acquired a complete ascendancy over Nana, who now respected her. Muffat even thought of an alliance between them. When he dared not say anything he let Satin loose. Twice she had compelled her darling to take up with him again, while he showed himself obliging and effaced himself in her favor at the least sign. But this good understanding lasted no time, for Satin, too, was a little cracked. On certain days she would very nearly go mad and would smash everything, wearing herself out in tempest of love and anger, but pretty all the time. Zoe must have excited her, for the maid took her into corners as if she wanted to tell her about her great design of which she as yet spoke to no one.

When she confessed her relations with Foucarmont he suffered so acutely, he thought the treachery of the young man so base, that he wished to insult him and fight a duel.

The growing needs entailed by her luxurious way of life only added fuel to her desires, and she finished a man up at one mouthful. First she had Foucarmont, who did not last a fortnight. He was thinking of leaving the navy, having saved about thirty thousand francs in his ten years of service, which he wished to invest in the United States. His instincts, which were prudential, even miserly, were conquered; he gave her everything, even his signature to notes of hand, which pledged his future. When Nana had done with him he was penniless. But then she proved very kind; she advised him to return to his ship. What was the good of getting angry? Since he had no money their relations were no longer possible. He ought to understand that and to be reasonable. A ruined man fell from her hands like a ripe fruit, to rot on the ground by himself.

She called him a dirty Jew; she seemed to be paying back an old grudge, of which she had no distinct recollection. He was fat; he was stupid, and she got him down and took two bites at a time in order the quicker to do for this Prussian. As for him, he had thrown Simonne over. His Bosphorous scheme was getting shaky, and Nana hastened the downfall by wild expenses. For a month he struggled on, doing miracles of finance. He filled Europe with posters, advertisements and prospectuses of a colossal scheme and obtained money from the most distant climes. All these savings, the pounds of speculators and the pence of the poor, were swallowed up in the Avenue de Villiers. Again he was partner in an ironworks in Alsace, where in a small provincial town workmen, blackened with coal dust and soaked with sweat, day and night strained their sinews and heard their bones crack to satisfy Nana's pleasures. Like a huge fire she devoured all the fruits of stock-exchange swindling and the profits of labor. This time she did for Steiner; she brought him to the ground, sucked him dry to the core, left him so cleaned out that he was unable to invent a new roguery. When his bank failed he stammered and trembled at the idea of prosecution. His bankruptcy had just been published, and the simple mention of money flurried him and threw him into a childish embarrassment. And this was he who had played with millions. One evening at Nana's he began to cry and asked her for a loan of a hundred francs wherewith to pay his maidservant. And Nana, much affected and amused at the end of this terrible old man who had squeezed Paris for twenty years, brought it to him and said:

He had for some time been longing for the honor of being ruined by her in order to put the finishing stroke on his smartness. He needed a woman to launch him properly; it was the one thing still lacking. In two months all Paris would be talking of him, and he would see his name in the papers. Six weeks were enough. His inheritance was in landed estate, houses, fields, woods and farms. He had to sell all, one after the other, as quickly as he could. At every mouthful Nana swallowed an acre. The foliage trembling in the sunshine, the wide fields of ripe grain, the vineyards so golden in September, the tall grass in which the cows stood knee-deep, all passed through her hands as if engulfed by an abyss. Even fishing rights, a stone quarry and three mills disappeared. Nana passed over them like an invading army or one of those swarms of locusts whose flight scours a whole province. The ground was burned up where her little foot had rested. Farm by farm, field by field, she ate up the man's patrimony very prettily and quite inattentively, just as she would have eaten a box of sweet-meats flung into her lap between mealtimes. There was no harm in it all; they were only sweets! But at last one evening there only remained a single little wood. She swallowed it up disdainfully, as it was hardly worth the trouble opening one's mouth for. La Faloise laughed idiotically and sucked the top of his stick. His debts were crushing him; he was not worth a hundred francs a year, and he saw that he would be compelled to go back into the country and live with his maniacal uncle. But that did not matter; he had achieved smartness; the Figaro had printed his name twice. And with his meager neck sticking up between the turndown points of his collar and his figure squeezed into all too short a coat, he would swagger about, uttering his parrotlike exclamations and affecting a solemn listlessness suggestive of an emotionless marionette. He so annoyed Nana that she ended by beating him.

After having thrown over the countess he had fallen into Rose's hands, and she treated him as a lawful wife would have done. Mignon was simply Madame's major-domo. Installed as master of the house, the journalist lied to Rose and took all sorts of precautions when he deceived her. He was as scrupulous as a good husband, for he really wanted to settle down at last. Nana's triumph consisted in possessing and in ruining a newspaper that he had started with a friend's capital. She did not proclaim her triumph; on the contrary, she delighted in treating him as a man who had to be circumspect, and when she spoke of Rose it was as "poor Rose." The newspaper kept her in flowers for two months. She took all the provincial subscriptions; in fact, she took everything, from the column of news and gossip down to the dramatic notes. Then the editorial staff having been turned topsy-turvy and the management completely disorganized, she satisfied a fanciful caprice and had a winter garden constructed in a corner of her house: that carried off all the type. But then it was no joke after all! When in his delight at the whole business Mignon came to see if he could not saddle Fauchery on her altogether, she asked him if he took her for a fool. A penniless fellow living by his articles and his plays—not if she knew it! That sort of foolishness might be all very well for a clever woman like her poor, dear Rose! She grew distrustful: she feared some treachery on Mignon's part, for he was quite capable of preaching to his wife, and so she gave Fauchery his CONGE as he now only paid her in fame.

They cut a regular dash with his coin; they would send him off full speed to the other end of Paris in order to be alone and then when he came back, they would crack jokes and make allusions he could not understand. One day, urged by the journalist, she bet that she would smack his face, and that she did the very same evening and went on to harder blows, for she thought it a good joke and was glad of the opportunity of showing how cowardly men were. She called him her "slapjack" and would tell him to come and have his smack! The smacks made her hands red, for as yet she was not up to the trick. La Faloise laughed in his idiotic, languid way, though his eyes were full of tears. He was delighted at such familiarity; he thought it simply stunning.

Nowadays he was trusting to the last relics of his personal dignity in order to remain "Monsieur" among the servants and intimates of the house, the man, in fact, who because he gave most was the official lover. And his passion grew fiercer. He kept his position because he paid for it, buying even smiles at a high price. He was even robbed and he never got his money's worth, but a disease seemed to be gnawing his vitals from which he could not prevent himself suffering. Whenever he entered Nana's bedroom he was simply content to open the windows for a second or two in order to get rid of the odors the others left behind them, the essential smells of fair-haired men and dark, the smoke of cigars, of which the pungency choked him. This bedroom was becoming a veritable thoroughfare, so continually were boots wiped on its threshold. Yet never a man among them was stopped by the bloodstain barring the door. Zoe was still preoccupied by this stain; it was a simple mania with her, for she was a clean girl, and it horrified her to see it always there. Despite everything her eyes would wander in its direction, and she now never entered Madame's room without remarking:

Outside, in the open air of the street, he would weep occasionally out of sheer shame and disgust and would vow never to enter the room again. And the moment the portiere had closed behind him he was under the old influence once more and felt his whole being melting in the damp warm air of the place, felt his flesh penetrated by a perfume, felt himself overborne by a voluptuous yearning for self-annihilation. Pious and habituated to ecstatic experiences in sumptuous chapels, he there re-encountered precisely the same mystical sensations as when he knelt under some painted window and gave way to the intoxication of organ music and incense. Woman swayed him as jealously and despotically as the God of wrath, terrifying him, granting him moments of delight, which were like spasms in their keenness, in return for hours filled with frightful, tormenting visions of hell and eternal tortures. In Nana's presence, as in church, the same stammering accents were his, the same prayers and the same fits of despair—nay, the same paroxysms of humility peculiar to an accursed creature who is crushed down in the mire from whence he has sprung. His fleshly desires, his spiritual needs, were confounded together and seemed to spring from the obscure depths of his being and to bear but one blossom on the tree of his existence. He abandoned himself to the power of love and of faith, those twin levers which move the world. And despite all the struggles of his reason this bedroom of Nana's always filled him with madness, and he would sink shuddering under the almighty dominion of sex, just as he would swoon before the vast unknown of heaven.

When once she had him fast in her room and the doors were shut, she treated herself to a man's infamy.

Since yesterday he had been searching for him in order to inform him that the Countess Sabine, in a supreme fit of moral aberration, had but now taken flight with the manager of one of the departments in a large, fancy emporium. It was a fearful scandal, and all Paris was already talking about it. Seeing him under the influence of such religious exaltation, Venot felt the opportunity to be favorable and at once told him of the meanly tragic shipwreck of his house. The count was not touched thereby. His wife had gone? That meant nothing to him; they would see what would happen later on. And again he was seized with anguish, and gazing with a look of terror at the door, the walls, the ceiling, he continued pouring forth his single supplication:

From that day forth Muffat belonged to him entirely; he again became strictly attentive to the duties of religion; his life was utterly blasted. He had resigned his position as chamberlain out of respect for the outraged modesty of the Tuileries, and soon Estelle, his daughter, brought an action against him for the recovery of a sum of sixty thousand francs, a legacy left her by an aunt to which she ought to have succeeded at the time of her marriage. Ruined and living narrowly on the remains of his great fortune, he let himself be gradually devoured by the countess, who ate up the husks Nana had rejected. Sabine was indeed ruined by the example of promiscuity set her by her husband's intercourse with the wanton. She was prone to every excess and proved the ultimate ruin and destruction of his very hearth. After sundry adventures she had returned home, and he had taken her back in a spirit of Christian resignation and forgiveness. She haunted him as his living disgrace, but he grew more and more indifferent and at last ceased suffering from these distresses. Heaven took him out of his wife's hands in order to restore him to the arms of God, and so the voluptuous pleasures he had enjoyed with Nana were prolonged in religious ecstasies, accompanied by the old stammering utterances, the old prayers and despairs, the old fits of humility which befit an accursed creature who is crushed beneath the mire whence he sprang. In the recesses of churches, his knees chilled by the pavement, he would once more experience the delights of the past, and his muscles would twitch, and his brain would whirl deliciously, and the satisfaction of the obscure necessities of his existence would be the same as of old.

He was growing accustomed to Fauchery and was beginning at last to find the presence of his wife's husband infinitely advantageous to him. He would leave all the little household cares to the journalist and would trust him in the active superintendence of all their affairs. Nay, he devoted the money gained by his dramatic successes to the daily expenditure of the family, and as, on his part, Fauchery behaved sensibly, avoiding ridiculous jealousy and proving not less pliant than Mignon himself whenever Rose found her opportunity, the mutual understanding between the two men constantly improved. In fact, they were happy in a partnership which was so fertile in all kinds of amenities, and they settled down side by side and adopted a family arrangement which no longer proved a stumbling block. The whole thing was conducted according to rule; it suited admirably, and each man vied with the other in his efforts for the common happiness. That very evening Mignon had come by Fauchery's advice to see if he could not steal Nana's lady's maid from her, the journalist having formed a high opinion of the woman's extraordinary intelligence. Rose was in despair; for a month past she had been falling into the hands of inexperienced girls who were causing her continual embarrassment. When Zoe received him at the door he forthwith pushed her into the dining room. But at his opening sentence she smiled. The thing was impossible, she said, for she was leaving Madame and establishing herself on her own account. And she added with an expression of discreet vanity that she was daily receiving offers, that the ladies were fighting for her and that Mme Blanche would give a pile of gold to have her back.

It was her ambition to make her fortune thereby, and she was investing all her savings in it.

It was with this in view that she had tried to entice Satin, a little pig at that moment dying in hospital, so terribly had she done for herself.

He opened the doors familiarly and visited the drawing room and the winter garden, returning thence into the hall. This overwhelming luxury, this gilded furniture, these silks and velvets, gradually filled him with such a feeling of admiration that it set his heart beating. When Zoe came down to fetch him she offered to show him the other rooms, the dressing room, that is to say, and the bedroom.

Amid the downfall of the house and the servants' wild, wasteful race to destruction, massed-up riches still filled every gaping hole and overtopped every ruined wall. And Mignon, as he viewed this lordly monument of wealth, began recalling to mind the various great works he had seen. Near Marseilles they had shown him an aqueduct, the stone arches of which bestrode an abyss, a Cyclopean work which cost millions of money and ten years of intense labor. At Cherbourg he had seen the new harbor with its enormous works, where hundreds of men sweated in the sun while cranes filled the sea with huge squares of rock and built up a wall where a workman now and again remained crushed into bloody pulp. But all that now struck him as insignificant. Nana excited him far more. Viewing the fruit of her labors, he once more experienced the feelings of respect that had overcome him one festal evening in a sugar refiner's chateau. This chateau had been erected for the refiner, and its palatial proportions and royal splendor had been paid for by a single material—sugar. It was with something quite different, with a little laughable folly, a little delicate nudity—it was with this shameful trifle, which is so powerful as to move the universe, that she alone, without workmen, without the inventions of engineers, had shaken Paris to its foundations and had built up a fortune on the bodies of dead men.

Then the thought of this old man going away half dead in a cab and of her poor rough, whom she would never set eyes on again now that she had driven him so wild, brought on what looked like the beginnings of melancholia. After that she grew vexed to hear about Satin's illness. The girl had disappeared about a fortnight ago and was now ready to die at Lariboisiere, to such a damnable state had Mme Robert reduced her. When she ordered the horses to be put to in order that she might have a last sight of this vile little wretch Zoe had just quietly given her a week's notice. The announcement drove her to desperation at once! It seemed to her she was losing a member of her own family. Great heavens! What was to become of her when left alone? And she besought Zoe to stay, and the latter, much flattered by Madame's despair, ended by kissing her to show that she was not going away in anger. No, she had positively to go: the heart could have no voice in matters of business.

Yes, I can tell you this now: when I used to go with them—see? I didn't enjoy it; no, I didn't enjoy it one bit. It bored me, on my honor. Well then, I ask you whether I've got anything to do with it! Yes, they bored me to death! If it hadn't been for them and what they made of me, dear boy, I should be in a convent saying my prayers to the good God, for I've always had my share of religion. Dash it, after all, if they have dropped their money and their lives over it, what do I care? It's their fault. I've had nothing to do with it!"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2854');"><p>Zoe ushered in Mignon, and Nana received him smilingly. She had cried a good deal, but it was all over now. Still glowing with enthusiasm, he complimented her on her installation, but she let him see that she had had enough of her mansion and that now she had other projects and would sell everything up one of these days. Then as he excused himself for calling on the ground that he had come about a benefit performance in aid of old Bose, who was tied to his armchair by paralysis, she expressed extreme pity and took two boxes. Meanwhile Zoe announced that the carriage was waiting for Madame, and she asked for her hat and as she tied the strings told them about poor, dear Satin's mishap, adding:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2855');"><p>"I'm going to the hospital. Nobody ever loved me as she did. Oh, they're quite right when they accuse the men of heartlessness! Who knows? Perhaps I shan't see her alive. Never mind, I shall ask to see her: I want to give her a kiss."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2855" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我到医院去……谁也没有像她那样爱过我。啊！人家说男人没有良心，这话一点也不错！……谁知道呢？也许我再也见不到她了，那不要紧，我去要求见她一次，我想拥抱她。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2856');"><p>Labordette and Mignon smiled, and as Nana was no longer melancholy she smiled too. Those two fellows didn't count; they could enter into her feelings. And they both stood and admired her in silent abstraction while she finished buttoning her gloves. She alone kept her feet amid the heaped-up riches of her mansion, while a whole generation of men lay stricken down before her. Like those antique monsters whose redoubtable domains were covered with skeletons, she rested her feet on human skulls. She was ringed round with catastrophes. There was the furious immolation of Vandeuvres; the melancholy state of Foucarmont, who was lost in the China seas; the smashup of Steiner, who now had to live like an honest man; the satisfied idiocy of La Faloise, and the tragic shipwreck of the Muffats. Finally there was the white corpse of Georges, over which Philippe was now watching, for he had come out of prison but yesterday. She had finished her labor of ruin and death. The fly that had flown up from the ordure of the slums, bringing with it the leaven of social rottenness, had poisoned all these men by merely alighting on them. It was well done—it was just. She had avenged the beggars and the wastrels from whose caste she issued. And while, metaphorically speaking, her sex rose in a halo of glory and beamed over prostrate victims like a mounting sun shining brightly over a field of carnage, the actual woman remained as unconscious as a splendid animal, and in her ignorance of her mission was the good-natured courtesan to the last. She was still big; she was still plump; her health was excellent, her spirits capital. But this went for nothing now, for her house struck her as ridiculous. It was too small; it was full of furniture which got in her way. It was a wretched business, and the long and the short of the matter was she would have to make a fresh start. In fact, she was meditating something much better, and so she went off to kiss Satin for the last time. She was in all her finery and looked clean and solid and as brand new as if she had never seen service before.
