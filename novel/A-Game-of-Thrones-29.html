</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2493');"><p>My lady, you ought cover your head," Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north. "You will take a chill."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2493" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，您还是把头包住，”他们骑马踽踽北行，途中罗德利克爵士一再告诫她，“不然会着凉的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2494');"><p>"It is only water, Ser Rodrik," Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a loose strand stuck to her forehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look, but for once she did not care. The southern rain was soft and warm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother’s kisses. It took her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered the godswood, drooping branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her brother’s laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves. She remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown between her fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he’d eaten so much mud he was sick for a week. How young they all had been.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2494" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“罗德利克爵士，淋点雨没什么大不了。”凯特琳回答。她的湿头发沉甸甸地垂下来，一撮松掉的发束黏贴在额头上，不难想像自己的模样有多狼狈，但这次她却不在乎。南国的雨柔软而温和，凯特琳喜欢用脸颊去体会这种轻如慈母亲吻的感觉。这感觉将她带回到童年时代，忆起在奔流城度过的那些灰蒙蒙的日子。她记得饱溢湿气的神木林，枝干低垂；记得弟弟追着她跑过一堆堆湿叶，笑声清脆。她也记得和莱莎玩泥巴的种种情景，记得泥团在手中的重量，滑溜的褐泞在指间流动的感觉。后来，她们咯咯笑着把做好的泥饼端给小指头吃，他竟当真吃了一堆，足足病了一个星期。啊，记得当时年纪还小。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2495');"><p>Catelyn had almost forgotten. In the north, the rain fell cold and hard, and sometimes at night it turned to ice. It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it, and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter. That was no rain for little girls to play in.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2495" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳本以为自己早已忘却了这些事。北境的雨寒冷而无情，有时入夜还会成霜。说是滋养生殖，转眼就变成作物杀手，连成人遇上也纷纷走避。这种雨，哪是给小女孩玩的呢？ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2496');"><p>"I am soaked through," Ser Rodrik complained. "Even my bones are wet." The woods pressed close around them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud. "We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot meal would serve us both."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2496" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“全身都湿透了，”罗德利克爵士抱怨，“湿到骨子里去了。”他们周围树林浓密，叶梢的落雨声伴着马蹄行走泥泞的响动。“夫人，我们今晚该找个有火的地方歇歇，若能吃点热东西更好。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2497');"><p>"There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead," Catelyn told him. She had slept many a night there in her youth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime, always riding somewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. The sweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded those smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha’s teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2497" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“前面路口有家旅店。”凯特琳告诉他。她年轻时与父亲外出曾多次在此借宿。霍斯特•徒利公爵壮年时在城里待不住，总是骑马到处晃荡。她还记得旅馆主人是个不分昼夜嚼着烟叶、名叫玛莎•海德的胖女人。玛莎似乎永远都是笑容满面，还常拿蛋糕给孩子们吃。她的蛋糕浸过蜂蜜，吃起来香味浓郁。只是凯特琳很怕她的笑容，因为烟草把牙齿染成了暗红色，笑起来似乎血淋淋，怪吓人的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2498');"><p>"An inn," Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully. "If only?.?.?.?but we dare not risk it. If we wish to remain unknown, I think it best we seek out some small holdfast?.?.?.?" He broke off as they heard sounds up the road; splashing water, the clink of mail, a horse’s whinny. "Riders," he warned, his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword. Even on the kingsroad, it never hurt to be wary.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2498" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有旅馆当然好，”罗德利克爵士满心向往地重复了一辫。“不过……我们最好还是别冒险，为了避免被人认出，还是找家民居借宿比较妥……”这时路上传来盔甲铿锵、马匹嘶鸣和雨水溅洒的声音，他急忙住口。“有人。”他一边出声警告，一边伸手握住剑柄。即便是在国王大道，小心谨慎也绝对有益无害。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2499');"><p>They followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them; a column of armed men noisily fording a swollen stream. Catelyn reined up to let them pass. The banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp, but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of Seagard. "Mallisters," Ser Rodrik whispered to her, as if she had not known. "My lady, best pull up your hood."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2499" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们循声而去，绕过一个慵懒的弯道，看见那一群成纵队行进的人马，全副武装，正嘈杂地渡过涨水的溪流。凯特琳拉住缰绳让他们先行。骑在队伍前列的人高举的旗臶已然湿透，垂挂下来，看不清晰。但来人都穿着蓝紫色的披风，海疆城的银色飞鹰纹章在肩头飞扬。“是梅利斯特家的人。”罗德利克爵士朝她耳语，生怕她不知道。“夫人，我看您还是把兜帽拉起来吧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2500');"><p>Catelyn made no move. Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them, surrounded by his knights, his son Patrek by his side and their squires close behind. They were riding for King’s Landing and the Hand’s tourney, she knew. For the past week, the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad; knights and freeriders, singers with their harps and drums, heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of honey, traders and craftsmen and whores, and all of them moving south.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2500" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳没有照办。杰森•梅利斯特伯爵本人就在队伍里面，骑士们围绕四周，身边是儿子派崔克，侍从们则跟在后方。她一眼就看出他们是赶往君临参加首相的比武大会。过去这一个星期，国王大道上到处都是骑士和自由骑手，带着竖琴和皮鼓的吟游诗人，满载啤酒花、玉米和一桶桶蜂蜜的马车，还有生意人，工匠和妓女，汹涌的人潮使得国王大道拥挤不堪，所有人都往南走。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2501');"><p>She studied Lord Jason boldly. The last time she had seen him he had been jesting with her uncle at her wedding feast; the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys, and his gifts had been lavish. His brown hair was salted with white now, his face chiseled gaunt by time, yet the years had not touched his pride. He rode like a man who feared nothing. Catelyn envied him that; she had come to fear so much. As the riders passed, Lord Jason nodded a curt greeting, but it was only a high lord’s courtesy to strangers chance met on the road. There was no recognition in those fierce eyes, and his son did not even waste a look.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2501" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她不顾被认出的风险，好好地打量了杰森伯爵一番。上次见他还是在她婚宴之上，当时他只顾着和她叔叔说笑。梅利斯特家族是徒利家族的臣属，此人出手送礼向来大方。如今他的棕发间杂了几丝白色，岁月把他的脸庞凿出了痕迹，却并未减损他的骄傲，他骑在马上的神情天不怕地不怕。凯特琳实在羡慕，她自己担惊受怕可太多了。他们经过时，杰森男爵简单地点头致意，但那只是贵族老爷路遇陌生人时的基本礼貌。那双锐利的眼睛并没有认出她，而他儿子则根本连看都懒得看。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2502');"><p>"He did not know you," Ser Rodrik said after, wondering.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2502" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他竟没认出您。”之后罗德利克爵士疑惑地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2503');"><p>"He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and tired. It would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord. I think we shall be safe enough at the inn, Ser Rodrik."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2503" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他只看到两个又湿又累，溅满泥浆的旅人站在路边，绝想不到其中一个会是他主子的女儿。我想我们就算进了旅馆也会很安全的，罗德利克爵士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2504');"><p>It was near dark when they reached it, at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the Trident. Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered, still chewing her sourleaf, but she gave them only the most cursory of looks, with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile. "Two rooms at the top of the stair, that’s all there is," she said, chewing all the while. "They’re under the bell tower, you won’t be missing meals, though there’s some thinks it too noisy. Can’t be helped. We’re full up, or near as makes no matter. It’s those rooms or the road."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2504" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>旅馆位于三河汇流处以北的岔路口，他们抵达时天已快黑。玛莎•海德还在嚼她的烟草，比凯特琳记忆中胖了点，头发也灰白了些，好在她只草草瞟了他们一眼，没有露出恐怖的血腥微笑。“只剩楼上两间客房，别的没了，”她一边说，嘴里一边嚼个没完。“两间都在钟塔下，所以不用担心错过用餐，只是有人会嫌吵。没办法，人太多，我们差不多客满了。如果不要，就请两位上路。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2505');"><p>It was those rooms, low, dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase. "Leave your boots down here," Masha told them after she’d taken their coin. "The boy will clean them. I won’t have you tracking mud up my stairs. Mind the bell. Those who come late to meals don’t eat." There were no smiles, and no mention of sweet cakes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2505" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们当然要。房间在低矮积尘的阁楼内，要经过狭窄老旧的楼梯爬上去。“把鞋子留在这儿，”玛莎收了钱后告诉他们，“伙计待会儿来清理。我可不想看你们踩着烂泥上楼。注意钟声，来晚了就没得吃了。”她脸上没有笑容，也只字未提香甜的蛋糕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2506');"><p>When the supper bell rang, the sound was deafening. Catelyn had changed into dry clothes. She sat by the window, watching rain run down the pane. The glass was milky and full of bubbles, and a wet dusk was falling outside. Catelyn could just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2506" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当晚餐的钟声真的敲响时，简直震耳欲聋。凯特琳换了干衣服，正坐在窗边，凝视雨滴溜下窗棂。玻璃模糊不清，水珠密布，雨夜正要降临。凯特琳勉强分辨得出两条大路交会处的泥泞渡口。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2507');"><p>The crossroads gave her pause. If they turned west from here, it was an easy ride down to Riverrun. Her father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most, and she yearned to talk to him, to warn him of the gathering storm. If Winterfell needed to brace for war, how much more so Riverrun, so much closer to King’s Landing, with the power of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a shadow. If only her father had been stronger, she might have chanced it, but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these past two years, and Catelyn was loath to tax him now.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2507" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>看到岔路，她飘忽的视线不禁停了下来。假如他们由此向西，便可轻松愉快地抵达奔流城。父亲总会在她需要的时候给予睿臹的建议，她也渴望和他谈谈，警告他即将来临的风暴。倘若临冬城当真不免一战，奔流城更是首当其冲，因为它既靠近君临，西面又有如阴影般的凯岩城势力。若是父亲身体健康一点，她或许还会考虑，然而霍斯特•徒利卧病在床已有两年之久，凯特琳不愿再加重他的负担。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2508');"><p>The eastern road was wilder and more dangerous, climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into the Mountains of the Moon, past high passes and deep chasms to the Vale of Arryn and the stony Fingers beyond. Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and impregnable, its towers reaching for the sky. There she would find her sister?.?.?.?and, perhaps, some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa knew more than she had dared to put in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters to ruin, and if it came to war, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2508" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>东边的路比较崎岖，也更险恶，攀越岩石山丘和浓密树林，进入明月山脉，再穿过陡峭隘口和深渊绝壁，则会到达艾林谷，以及更远处崎岖多石的五指半岛。雄立于艾林谷顶端的鹰巢城固若金汤，高塔直向天际。在那里她可以找到妹妹莱莎……或许还能找到某些奈德求索的答案。莱莎信里想必有所保留，不敢多说，说不定她正持有奈德需要的证据，足以导致兰尼斯特家的毁灭。倘若真的开战，他们也需要得到艾林家族和其臣属的东境贵族们的支持。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2509');"><p>Yet the mountain road was perilous. Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock slides were common, and the mountain clans were lawless brigands, descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in search of them. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord as any the Eyrie had ever known, had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains. Catelyn’s only strength was one elderly knight, armored in loyalty.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2509" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而山路崎岖难行，危机四伏。影子山猫四处出没不提，落石是常有的事，山区氏族部落更是目无法纪的盗匪，他们从峰峦间呼啸而至，杀人越货后，一见峡谷派出骑士追剿，便如积雪融化般消失得无影无踪。就连琼恩•艾林如此少见的英明领主，每次穿越山脉也必定带上大批人马。而此刻凯特琳惟一的人马是个老骑士，惟一的屏障是他的忠诚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2510');"><p>No, she thought, Riverrun and the Eyrie would have to wait. Her path ran north to Winterfell, where her sons and her duty were waiting for her. As soon as they were safely past the Neck, she could declare herself to one of Ned’s bannermen, and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the kingsroad.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2510" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>不，她想，奔流城和鹰巢城以后再说，此刻她应该北上直取临冬城，她的三个儿子和重责大任正对她翘首以盼。只等安然渡过颈泽，她便可对奈德的封臣宣布身份，然后派信使骑马先行，发布国王大道戒严的消息。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2511');"><p>The rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land clear enough in her memory. The marketplace was just across the way, and the village a mile farther on, half a hundred white cottages surrounding a small stone sept. There would be more now; the summer had been long and peaceful. North of here the kingsroad ran along the Green Fork of the Trident, through fertile valleys and green woodlands, past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2511" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>雨丝遮蔽了岔路远方的田野，但凯特琳记忆里的风景依旧清晰。市集在路的那一头，再走一里有个村落，五十来间白色农舍围绕着一间小小的石砌圣堂。经过漫长而平静的夏季，如今村里的房舍想必更多了。由此向北，国王大道与三叉戟河的支流绿叉河平行，穿过肥沃谷地和青葱林荫，穿过繁荣市镇、坚实农庄以及河间贵族的城堡。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2512');"><p>Catelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, whose quarrels her father was obliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of her line, who dwelt with her ghosts in the cavernous vaults of Harrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and bastards and grandbastards as well. All of them were bannermen to the Tullys, their swords sworn to the service of Riverrun. Catelyn wondered if that would be enough, if it came to war. Her father was the staunchest man who’d ever lived, and she had no doubt that he would call his banners?.?.?.?but would the banners come? The Darrys and Rygers and Mootons had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, while Lord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over, leaving some doubt as to which army he had planned to join (theirs, he had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her father had called him the Late Lord Frey). It must not come to war, Catelyn thought fervently. They must not let it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2512" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳对每一位河间贵族都了若指掌：积怨已久的布莱伍德和布雷肯家族，每有纷争她父亲就得出面调停；身为家族最后传人的河安伯爵夫人蛰居于赫伦堡空寂的地窖里，整日与逝者相伴；暴躁的佛雷侯爵死了七任太太，他巍立大河两岸的孪河城里早已四代同堂，内家、外家、私生、百系，难以尽数。他们全都是徒利家的封臣，宣誓效忠于奔流城。但倘若战争真的爆发，凯特琳却不知道这样的阵容够不够坚强。父亲是世上最坚定最可靠的人，届时他一定会召集封臣……然而诸侯们都会来么？戴瑞家、莱格家和慕顿家虽然也都是奔流城的臣属，然而在三河之役中，他们却与雷加•坦格利安并肩作战。佛雷侯爵则是战争结束后方才带着人马姗姗来迟，不禁让人怀疑他原本打算为哪一边效力（事后，他郑重其事地向胜利者表示自己一直站在他们这一边，但从那以后父亲便改口叫他“迟到的佛雷侯爵”）。不能开战，凯特琳焦急地想，绝不能让战争爆发。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2513');"><p>Ser Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor. "We had best make haste if we hope to eat tonight, my lady."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2513" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>钟声停止，罗德利克爵士过来敲她房门。“夫人，我们快下去罢，不然恐怕吃不到东西了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2514');"><p>"It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck," she told him. "Common travelers attract less notice. A father and daughter taken to the road on some family business, say."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2514" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“过颈泽之前，我们不以爵士、夫人相称会比较安全，”她告诉他，“扮成寻常旅人不会引人注意。嗯，就说我们是父女出门探亲好了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2515');"><p>"As you say, my lady," Ser Rodrik agreed. It was only when she laughed that he realized what he’d done. "The old courtesies die hard, my, my daughter." He tried to tug on his missing whiskers, and sighed with exasperation.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2515" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那就这样办，夫人。”罗德利克爵士刚表同意，凯特琳便笑了起来，他才恍然大悟自己又说错了话。“习惯了，一时真改不过来，夫……女儿。”他伸手想捻他早已不见的胡子，不由得困窘地叹气。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2516');"><p>Catelyn took his arm. "Come, Father," she said. "You’ll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table, I think, but try not to praise her. You truly don’t want to see her smile."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2516" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳挽起他的手。“来罢，老爹，”她说，“玛莎•海德烧得一手好菜，我想你会喜欢的。不过千万别当面夸她，她那张笑脸还是不看为妙。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2517');"><p>The common room was long and drafty, with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and a fireplace at the other. A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while Masha drew beer from the kegs, chewing her sourleaf all the while.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2517" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大厅很长，通风良好，一边立着一排大木酒桶，另一边则是火炉。跑堂小弟拿着烤肉叉子跑来跑去，玛莎从酒桶里倒出啤酒，嘴里嚼的烟草却也没停。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2518');"><p>The benches were crowded, townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of travelers. The crossroads made for odd companions; dyers with black and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen reeking of fish, an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened old septon, hard-bitten sellswords and soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2518" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>长椅上座无虚席，村民和农夫与来历各异的旅客并肩而坐。一手黑一手紫的染坊师傅和满身鱼腥的讨河人坐在一起；浑身肌肉的铁匠缩着身子挤在瘦小的老修士旁边；一副硬汉模样的流浪武士和轻声细语的生意人像老友般交换着路上的消息。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2519');"><p>The company included more swords than Catelyn would have liked. Three by the fire wore the red stallion badge of the Brackens, and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery grey. On their shoulder was another familiar sigil, the twin towers of House Frey. She studied their faces, but they were all too young to have known her. The senior among them would have been no older than Bran when she went north.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2519" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而用餐的人里有太多带着刀剑，看得凯特琳有些担心。坐在炉边那三个佩着布雷肯家的红色骏马徽章，还有一大群身穿蓝钢环甲，肩披银灰披风的人，他们肩头所绣的正是她熟悉的佛雷家双塔纹章。她一一打量他们的脸，但他们年纪都太小，认不出来。里面年纪稍长的，在她嫁到北方时也不过是布兰现在的年龄。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2520');"><p>Ser Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen. Across the table a handsome youth was fingering a woodharp. "Seven blessings to you, goodfolk," he said as they sat. An empty wine cup stood on the table before him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2520" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗德利克爵士在靠近厨房的长椅上找到两个位子，饭桌对面坐了个英俊的年轻人，手里正拨弄着木头竖琴。“好心人，七神保佑你们。”他们坐下时他开口道。一个空酒杯摆在他面前。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2521');"><p>"And to you, singer," Catelyn returned. Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that meant now. The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed them boldly and asked where they were going, and from whence they had come, and what news they had, letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer. "We left King’s Landing a fortnight ago," Catelyn replied, answering the safest of his questions.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2521" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“也保佑你，好歌手。”凯特琳回答。罗德利克爵士用一种“现在就要”的口气叫了面包、肉和啤酒。歌手约莫十八岁，他大胆地瞧着他们，问他们打哪儿来，往哪儿走，路上有些什么消息等等，连珠炮似的一串问题，叫人不及反应。“我们两个星期前从君临出发的。”凯特琳挑了最安全的问题回答。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2522');"><p>"That’s where I’m bound," the youth said. As she had suspected, he was more interested in telling his own story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices. "The Hand’s tourney means rich lords with fat purses. The last time I came away with more silver than I could carry?.?.?.?or would have, if I hadn’t lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2522" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我正要去那儿呢。”年轻人道。果然不出她所料，他对说自己的事远比听他们的事感兴趣。歌手们最爱的莫过于炫耀自己的声音。“首相比武大会上财主老爷肯定多的是，上回我赚的钱多到搬不动……呃，只可惜我后来把注下在 ‘弑君者’身上，输了个精光。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2523');"><p>"The gods frown on the gambler," Ser Rodrik said sternly. He was of the north, and shared the Stark views on tournaments.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2523" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸神在上，赌徒本该遭天谴。”罗德利克爵士口气严峻。身为北方人的他，和史塔克家一样对比武大会没好感。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2524');"><p>"They frowned on me, for certain," the singer said. "Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers altogether did me in."

"So long as the fire’s warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas, I am a happy man."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2542" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳看到他们一行四人：一个穿着守夜人黑衫的老头，两个仆从……还有他，小个子好端端地站在那里。“我手下睡马厩就好，至于我嘛，你也看得出来，我不需要多大的房间。”他自我解嘲地嘻嘻一笑。“所以只要火够温暖，稻草里没太多跳蚤，我就很乐意啦。”

</p></origin><translate id="div_2550" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>侏儒连看都没看房间这边一眼，凯特琳心里暗自庆幸，还好自己的位置与他们隔了这么多拥挤的餐桌和长凳。这时马瑞里安突然跳将起来。“兰尼斯特大人！”他叫道，“我可能荣幸地在您用餐时为您娱乐助兴？让我为您唱一首歌颂令尊大人君临大捷的歌罢！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2551');"><p>"Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper," the dwarf said dryly. His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away?.?.?.?and found Catelyn. He looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too late. The dwarf was smiling. "Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure," he said. "I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2551" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那我不反胃死才怪。”侏儒酸酸地说。他用大小不一的眼睛打量了歌手一眼，正准备挪开视线……却看到了凯特琳。他困惑地看了她半晌，她别过头，但为时已晚。侏儒露出微笑。“史塔克夫人，好个意外的惊喜。”他说，“很遗憾没能在临冬城见到您。”

Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords, and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no time to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. "You in the corner," she said to an older man she had not noticed until now. "Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat, ser?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2554" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我上次在此投宿时，还是徒利家的凯特琳。”她告诉老板娘。她听见人群低声议论，感觉到众人的眼光集中在自己身上。凯特琳环顾房间，看着众位骑士和誓言骑士，然后深吸一口气，缓和狂乱的心跳。她真要冒险吗？没有时间仔细思量，机会转瞬即逝。她只听见自己的声音在耳际回荡。“坐在角落那位先生，”她先前没注意到这位年纪较长的人。“您外衣上绣的可是赫伦堡的黑蝙蝠？”
