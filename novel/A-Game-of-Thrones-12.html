</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_894');"><p>Daenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of Pentos, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man’s life must be done beneath the open sky.
</p></origin><translate id="div_894" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮莉丝•坦格利安满心恐惧，在潘托斯城郊草原上与卓戈卡奥成了婚。之所以选在这里，是因为多斯拉克人认为所有的人生大事，都应该让苍天作见证。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_895');"><p>Drogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come, forty thousand Dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women, children, and slaves. Outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds, raising palaces of woven grass, eating everything in sight, and making the good folk of Pentos more anxious with every passing day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_895" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈号召他的卡拉萨参加婚礼，他们便都如约前来，包括浩浩荡荡四万名多斯拉克武士，以及难以计数的妇孺奴隶。他们带着为数众多的牲口，扎营于城墙之外，快速搭成草织的宫殿，吃辫目光所及的一切食物，让潘托斯的居民越来越不安。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_896');"><p>"My fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard," Illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been Drogo’s. The khal had joined his khalasar, his estate given over to Daenerys and her brother until the wedding.
</p></origin><translate id="div_896" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“其他总督把城市守卫翻了一倍。”有天晚上，伊利里欧边吃着一碟碟蜂蜜烤鸭和胡椒橙，边对他们说。卡奥已经回到卡拉萨之中，他的宅院就暂时让丹妮莉丝和哥哥居住，直到婚礼结束。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_897');"><p>"Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to sellswords and bravos," Ser Jorah Mormont jested. The exile had offered her brother his sword the night Dany had been sold to Kbal Drogo; Viserys had accepted eagerly. Mormont had been their constant companion ever since.
</p></origin><translate id="div_897" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我看咱们得尽快让丹妮莉丝公主嫁出门，免得潘托斯的财富都给佣兵和无赖赚跑了。”乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士玩笑道。丹妮被卖给卓戈卡奥的当晚，这位遭放逐的骑士便提议为哥哥效力。韦赛里斯迫不及待地答应下来，从那之后，莫尔蒙便成了随侍他们左右的伙伴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_898');"><p>Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard, but Viserys did not so much as smile. "He can have her tomorrow, if he likes," her brother said. He glanced over at Dany, and she lowered her eyes. "So long as he pays the price."
</p></origin><translate id="div_898" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊利里欧总督抖着胡子轻轻笑了，但韦赛里斯连嘴唇都没动一下。“他高兴的话，明天就要她也行。”哥哥说着瞟了丹妮一眼，她垂下眼睛。“只要他信守诺言。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_899');"><p>Illyrio waved a languid hand in the air, rings glittering on his fat fingers. "I have told you, all is settled. Trust me. The khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_899" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊利里欧无力地挥挥手，胖手指上一堆戒指闪闪发光。“我跟您说过，一切都打点妥当啦。卡奥既已答应要给你一顶王冠，他就一定说到做到。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_900');"><p>"Yes, but when?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_900" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好吧，可什么时候给呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_901');"><p>"When the khal chooses," Illyrio said. "He will have the girl first, and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dothrak. After that, perhaps. If the omens favor war."
</p></origin><translate id="div_901" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这就要看卡奥他的意思了。”伊利里欧道，“他当然会先要这女孩，等完婚之后，还要带着人马横跨草原，带她晋见维斯•多斯拉克的多希卡林。在那之后，他应该会实现诺言，如果预兆显示战争吉利的话。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_902');"><p>Viserys seethed with impatience. "I piss on Dothraki omens. The Usurper sits on my father’s throne. How long must I wait?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_902" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>韦赛里斯一脸不耐烦：“我管他妈的多斯拉克预兆。篡夺者坐在我父王的王座上，我还得等多久？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_903');"><p>Illyrio gave a massive shrug. "You have waited most of your life, great king. What is another few months, another few years?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_903" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊利里欧耸耸宽大的肩膀。“伟大的国王啊，您已经等了大半辈子，再多等几月……就算再多等个几年，又怎么样呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_904');"><p>Ser Jorah, who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak, nodded in agreement. "I counsel you to be patient, Your Grace. The Dothraki are true to their word, but they do things in their own time. A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_904" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>交游广泛，足迹远至维斯•多斯拉克的乔拉爵士点头同意。“陛下，我也建议您耐心等待。多斯拉克人言出必践，但方式却得照他们的意思来。地位较低的人或许可以恳求卡奥帮忙，但千万不能用以上对下之姿教训他。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_905');"><p>Viserys bristled. "Guard your tongue, Mormont, or I’ll have it out. I am no lesser man, I am the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. The dragon does not beg."
</p></origin><translate id="div_905" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>韦赛里斯怒道：“莫尔蒙，你讲话最好注意点，否则小心我把你舌头给割了。我可不是什么地位较低的人，我乃堂堂七国之君，真龙传人是不会卑躬屈膝的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_906');"><p>Ser Jorah lowered his eyes respectfully. Illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck. Honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat. There are no more dragons, Dany thought, staring at her brother, though she did not dare say it aloud.
</p></origin><translate id="div_906" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士恭敬地垂下眼睛。伊利里欧神秘地笑笑，撕下一只鸭翅膀，咬了起来，胡子上沾满蜂蜜和油汁。真龙已经不复存在了，丹妮怔怔地看着哥哥，却不敢大声说出来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_907');"><p>Yet that night she dreamt of one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear. She ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell. "You woke the dragon," he screamed as he kicked her. "You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon." Her thighs were slick with blood. She closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all around, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head slowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_907" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而那天晚上，她却梦见了一只龙。梦中韦赛里斯又在打她、欺负她。她浑身赤裸，害怕得手足无措。她想从他身边跑开，身体却不听使唤。他再度出手，把她打得踉跄倒地。“你唤醒了睡龙之怒，”他一边尖叫一边对她拳打脚踢，“你唤醒了睡龙，你唤醒了睡龙。”她的大腿淌满鲜血，正闭眼呻吟，只听一阵狰狞的撕裂，接着是一片雄浑的大火劈啪，仿佛有谁在回应。睁眼一看，韦赛里斯已经不见踪影，四周升起巨大火柱，火柱中间有一头巨龙。它缓缓转头，那对宛如熔岩的眼睛与她目光相接。这时她便醒了，醒来时浑身颤抖，冷汗直流。她这辈子从没这么害怕过……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_908');"><p>?.?.?.?until the day of her wedding came at last.
</p></origin><translate id="div_908" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>……除了这场婚礼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_909');"><p>The ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk, an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting. A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces, and there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo, above the seething sea of Dothraki. She had never seen so many people in one place, nor people so strange and frightening. The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits. They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank themselves blind on fermented mare’s milk and Illyrio’s fine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien in Dany’s ears.
</p></origin><translate id="div_909" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>婚宴从黎明开始，一直持续到天黑，其间充斥着无止尽的暴饮暴食和冲突打斗。草织宫殿间筑起一座土丘，丹妮被安置在卓戈卡奥身旁，位居这片多斯拉克人海之上。她从未见过这么多人聚集一起，也未见过如此奇怪又叫人害怕的族群。众位马王来自由贸易城邦拜访时也会穿戴华服，喷洒香水，然而在苍天之下，他们却遵守古老传统。不论男女，均赤裸胸膛，外罩彩绘皮背心，捆上马鬃绑腿，腰系青铜饰带。男性战士们用油坑里的动物脂肪把长长的发辪抹得乌黑光亮。他们大啖加了蜂蜜和胡椒的烤马肉，豪饮发酵马奶和伊利里欧的葡萄佳酿，隔着营火互相笑闹，话音在丹妮耳中显得格外陌生而刺耳。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_910');"><p>Viserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest. Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him. Theirs was a place of high honor, just below the khal’s own bloodriders, but Dany could see the anger in her brother’s lilac eyes. He did not like sitting beneath her, and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the portions they refused. He could do nothing but nurse his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person.
</p></origin><translate id="div_910" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>韦赛里斯坐在她正下方，穿着一袭崭新黑羊毛衫，胸前绣了一头猩红色的龙。伊利里欧和乔拉爵士坐在他旁边。他们实已居于高位，仅次于卡奥的血盟卫，但丹妮仍然看出哥哥那双淡紫色眼瞳里闪着怒火。他不高兴位于她之下，更受不了每次上菜仆人都会先给卡奥和他的新娘，然后才把挑剩的拿给他。但除了暗自生气，他不能做什么，于是就这么生着闷气，表情也随着时间流逝，随着每一次对他自尊的伤害越见恶劣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_911');"><p>Dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. Her brother had told her to smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes. She did her best to hide them, knowing how angry Viserys would be if he saw her crying, terrified of how Khal Drogo might react. Food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and Dothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos, but she waved it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it down.
</p></origin><translate id="div_911" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而丹妮无暇他顾，置身这片广大人海之中，她只感到前所未有的孤独。哥哥要她微笑，所以她努力保持笑容，直到脸部肌肉酸疼，眼泪也不争气地流了下来。她竭力隐藏泪水，因为她太清楚要是教韦赛里斯见到会有多生气，她更害怕卓戈卡奥的反应。食物一盘盘端至眼前，有香气四溢的肉块，肥厚的黑香肠，多斯拉克血馅饼，后来还有各式水果，甜菜汤，以及做工精巧的潘托斯蛋糕，但她都一一挥手赶开。她很清楚自己的胃搅成一团，没法吞下任何东西。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_912');"><p>There was no one to talk to. Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders, and laughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him. They had no common language. Dothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have welcomed the conversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_912" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>没有人陪她聊天解闷。卓戈卡奥朝下方的血盟卫大声嬉笑吆喝，随他们的回答而放声大笑，但他自始至终都不看身旁的丹妮一眼。他们没有共通的语言，她听不懂多斯拉克语，而卡奥只会说几句自由贸易城邦的瓦雷利亚方言，通行七国的辬准话语他一窍不通。就算只能跟伊利里欧和哥哥说话，她也非常乐意，只可惜他们的座位离她实在太远。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_913');"><p>So she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to herself. I am blood of the dragon, she told herself. I am Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone, of the blood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror.
</p></origin><translate id="div_913" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是她只能身披婚纱，端着一杯掺了蜂蜜的葡萄酒，不吃不动，静静地自言自语：“我是真龙传人，”她告诉自己，“我是风暴降生丹妮莉丝，龙石岛的公主，体内流着’征服者‘伊耿的血液。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_914');"><p>The sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die. Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal. Drogo watched without expression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over.
</p></origin><translate id="div_914" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>目睹当天第一个人丧命时，太阳才刚在天顶移动了四分之一。当时鼓声隆隆，女人们正为卡奥跳舞助兴。卓戈虽面无表情，视线却始终跟随她们的律动，不时还从腰带上解下一个青铜奖章抛过去，让她们为之争得你死我活。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_915');"><p>The warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had told her that might happen. "The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do."
</p></origin><translate id="div_915" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其他战士也在旁观赏。后来其中一个终于走进舞者的圆圈，伸手攫住一位舞者的臂膀，把她按倒在地，当场就像公马和母马交配似地做了起来。伊利里欧先前就提醒过她：“多斯拉克人交配的方式和他们养的牲畜没两样。卡拉萨里毫无隐私可言，他们对罪恶和耻辱的观念也与我们完全不同。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_916');"><p>Dany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert her eyes. Then two men seized the same woman. She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe. A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash. No one made a move to interfere.
</p></origin><translate id="div_916" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮明白了眼前发生的事后，突然害怕起来，忙将视线从交合中的两人身上转开，但紧接着另一个战士也走上前，然后又是一个，很快她连想不看也没办法了。只见两名男子抓住了同一个女人，她听见一声大叫，其中一人推了对方一把，眨眼功夫，两把亚拉克弯刀便已出鞘。这是一种半剑半镰刀的武器，刀刃很长、利如剃刀。两名战士随即展开一阵死亡剑舞，绕着圈子，相互杀伐，扑跳往来，刀锋流转，喊骂不绝。没有人出手干预。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_917');"><p>It ended as quickly as it began. The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow, one man missed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki’s waist, and opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling his entrails into the dust. As the loser died, the winner took hold of the nearest woman, not even the one they had been quarreling over, and had her there and then. Slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_917" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>死斗蓦然开始，也旋即结束。亚拉克弯刀交击的速度快得丹妮跟不上，但其中一名战士脚步没站稳，他的对手立刻挥刀画出一个圆唬刀锋砍进多斯拉克人腰部，将他自脊椎到腹部整个切开，内脏喷洒出来撒进尘土。败者挣扎惨死，胜者抓住最近的女人——还不是刚才为之而战的那个——当下做了起来。奴隶抬走尸首，舞蹈继续进行。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_918');"><p>Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too. "A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair," he had said. Her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died.
</p></origin><translate id="div_918" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这种情形，伊利里欧总督事前也警告过丹妮。“任何一场多斯拉克婚礼，若没有闹出至少三条人命，就算失败。”如此说来，她的婚礼想必受到上苍格外眷顾，因为在当天日落之前，一共死了十二个人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_919');"><p>As the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all she could do not to scream. She was afraid of the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all. She was afraid of her brother, of what he might do if she failed him. Most of all, she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask.
</p></origin><translate id="div_919" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>时间一分一秒过去，丹妮心中的恐惧却不减反增，最后她所能做的，就只剩下竭力控臸自己，不要发出尖叫。她害怕这些行径怪异野蛮，宛如披人皮野兽的多斯拉克人；害怕自己达不到哥哥的期望，不知他会对自己做出什么事来；但最教她害怕的，还是当天晚上，哥哥将她交给此刻坐在她身边喝酒，面无表情，残酷得像戴着一张青铜面具的怪异巨人后，他会在星空下对她做的事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_920');"><p>I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_920" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我是真龙传人。”她再度对自己说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_921');"><p>When at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped his hands together, and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt. Drogo stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him. It was time for her bride gifts.
</p></origin><translate id="div_921" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>最后，夕阳渐渐西落，卓戈卡奥拍拍手，所有的鼓声、叫喊和饮宴欢闹顿时戛然而止。卓戈起身，然后扶丹妮起来。赠送新娘礼的仪式开始了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_922');"><p>And after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage. Dany tried to put the thought aside, but it would not leave her. She hugged herself to try to keep from shaking.
</p></origin><translate id="div_922" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可她很清楚，当赠礼仪式结束，太阳下山之后，她就算是真正结婚。丹妮试图抛开这个念头，却徒劳无功，只能绷紧身子，想尽办法不要颤抖。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_923');"><p>Her brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids. Dany knew they had cost him nothing; Illyrio no doubt had provided the girls. Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped eyes, Doreah a fair-haired, blue-eyed Lysene girl. "These are no common servants, sweet sister," her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one. "Illyrio and I selected them personally for you. Irri will teach you riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and Doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love." He smiled thinly. "She’s very good, Illyrio and I can both swear to that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_923" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哥哥韦赛里斯送她三位女仆——丹妮知道他根本没花半文钱，必定是伊利里欧掏的腰包——其中伊丽和姬琪是生着杏眼，黑发褐肤的多斯拉克人，多莉亚则是金发蓝眼的里斯女孩。“好妹妹，这些可不是普通奴婢，”她们被依序带到她跟前时，哥哥告诉她，“都是我和伊利里欧精心为你挑选的。伊丽会教你骑马，姬琪会教你多斯拉克语，多莉亚则会教你床上功夫。”他浅浅一笑，“她可是这方面的专家，我和伊利里欧都可以保证。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_924');"><p>Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift. "It is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor exile could afford," he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her. They were histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common Tongue. She thanked him with all her heart.
</p></origin><translate id="div_924" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士为他的礼物致歉：“公主殿下，这点小东西实在不成敬意，但放逐在外，一贫如洗的我就只负担得起这个了。”说着他把一小叠旧书放在她面前，那是用辬准用语写成的七国历史和歌谣传奇，她满心感激地谢谢他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_925');"><p>Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce?.?.?.?and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked with gold. The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. "What are they?" she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder.
</p></origin><translate id="div_925" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伊利里欧总督轻声下令，四位粗壮的奴隶立刻抬着一个青铜装饰的雪松木箱快步向前。打开之后，她发现里面装满了自由贸易城邦所产最上等的天鹅绒和锦缎……其上还躺着三颗硕大的蛋。丹妮差点喘不过气来。这是她所见过最美的东西，三颗蛋外表各不相同，其上的纹彩富丽得使她以为表面镶满珠宝，而她得用两手才能抱住一颗。她小心翼翼地拿起来，本以为这是上等陶瓷、彩釉或玻璃臸成，想不到却比那沉重得多，仿佛是硬石做的。蛋壳表面覆盖着细小鳞片，它们随她指头转弄，映着落日余晖，散发出宛如金属般的光泽。其中一颗是深绿色，随着丹妮转动的角度露出各式的青铜斑点；另一颗是淡乳白色，有金色条纹；最后一颗是黑的，宛如午夜汪洋，却有生气勃发的暗红波浪和旋涡。“这是什么？”她小声问，口中充满惊奇。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_926');"><p>"Dragon’s eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai," said Magister Illyrio. "The eons have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty."
</p></origin><translate id="div_926" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是来自亚夏以东阴影之地的龙蛋。”伊利里欧总督说，“历经千万年而成化石，却依旧亮丽动人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_927');"><p>"I shall treasure them always." Dany had heard tales of such eggs, but she had never seen one, nor thought to see one. It was a truly magnificent gift, though she knew that Illyrio could afford to be lavish. He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to Khal Drogo.
</p></origin><translate id="div_927" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我会永远珍藏他们。”丹妮听过关于龙蛋的种种传闻，但从未亲眼目睹，更没想到会有机会见识。这实在是价值连城的厚礼，虽然她也知道伊利里欧花得起大钱。光是把她卖给卓戈卡奥，就让他赚了大批良驹和奴隶。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_928');"><p>The khal’s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons they were. Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold, and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was. Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings. "This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, O blood of my blood, and I am but a woman. Let my lord husband bear these in my stead." And so Khal Drogo too received his "bride gifts."
</p></origin><translate id="div_928" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>依照传统，卡奥的血盟卫赠与她三件耀眼武器。哈戈送她一把银柄长鞭，科霍罗送她一柄气派非凡的镀金亚拉克弯刀，柯索则送她一把比她人还高的双弧龙骨长弓。伊利里欧总督和乔拉爵士事先教过她传统的拒绝仪式。“吾血之血啊，这些都是伟大的战士应有的武器，但我仅是一介弱女子，就让我的夫君替我使用罢！”于是卓戈卡奥得到了她的“新娘礼”。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_929');"><p>Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair, medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice. "A handsome gift, Khaleesi," Magister Illyrio said of the last, after he had told her what it was. "Most lucky." The gifts mounted up around her in great piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she could want or use.
</p></origin><translate id="div_929" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其他多斯拉克人也纷纷上前，送她许多礼物：有珠宝拖鞋、银臸发环、奖章腰带、彩绘背心和轻软毛皮，纱丝和香精罐，针线、羽毛和小巧的紫玻璃瓶，以及一件以千只老鼠皮织成的睡衣。“卡丽熙①，这可是件好礼啊，”伊利里欧总督边对她解释，边说，“非常吉利的！”礼物在她身边堆得老高，远超出她的想像，更超乎她的真正需要。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_930');"><p>And last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her. An expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar. When he returned, the dense press of Dothraki gift-givers parted before him, and he led the horse to her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_930" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>最后，卓戈卡奥带来他自己的新娘礼。他大步离开她身边，一阵充满期待的静默便从营地中央散开，逐渐吞没了整个卡拉萨。他回来之时，送礼的多斯拉克人们向两边散开，原来他牵来了一匹马。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_931');"><p>She was a young filly, spirited and splendid. Dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was no ordinary animal. There was something about her that took the breath away. She was grey as the winter sea, with a mane like silver smoke.
</p></origin><translate id="div_931" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那是一匹年轻的小母马，精神抖擞、闪亮动人。仅凭丹妮对马有限的了解，就已经知道这并非匹寻常良驹。它有种叫她喘不过气的特臼，毛发灰如冬季的海，马鬃有若银色的烟。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_932');"><p>Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse’s neck, ran her fingers through the silver of her mane. Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated. "Silver for the silver of your hair, the khal says."
</p></origin><translate id="div_932" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她有些犹豫地伸手抚摸马的脖子，任手指滑过银色马鬃。卓戈卡奥用多斯拉克语说了几句，伊利里欧总督翻译道：“卡奥说，银色的马鬃正好配上你银色的头发。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_933');"><p>"She’s beautiful," Dany murmured.
</p></origin><translate id="div_933" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她好漂亮！”丹妮喃喃道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_934');"><p>"She is the pride of the khalasar, " Illyrio said. "Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal."
</p></origin><translate id="div_934" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她是全卡拉萨的骄傲，”伊利里欧说，“根据习俗，卡丽熙必须骑着与她身份地位相称的马儿，跟随在卡奥身边。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_935');"><p>Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist. He lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle, so much smaller than the ones she was used to. Dany sat there uncertain for a moment. No one had told her about this part. "What should I do?" she asked Illyrio.
</p></origin><translate id="div_935" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈跨步向前，伸手环住她的腰，有如抱小孩般把她轻松抱起，让她坐上狭小的多斯拉克马鞍。这鞍比她以前习惯的那种小许多。丹妮有些困惑地坐了一会儿。没人告诉她会如此发展。 “我该怎么做？”她问伊利里欧。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_936');"><p>It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered. "Take the reins and ride. You need not go far."
</p></origin><translate id="div_936" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>回答的是乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士，“握起缰绳骑上一段，不用太远。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_937');"><p>Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups. She was only a fair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback. Praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees.
</p></origin><translate id="div_937" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是丹妮紧张地双手握缰，把脚伸进矮矮的马镫里。她马术平平，只因长久以来多半乘船或搭马车、轿子旅行，骑马的机会不多。她祈祷自己不要摔下来，惹大家笑话，最后轻轻地一夹马肚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_938');"><p>And for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid. Or perhaps it was for the first time ever.
</p></origin><translate id="div_938" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，这几个小时以来，她第一次忘却了恐惧。或许，是她这辈子第一次。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_939');"><p>The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd parted for her, every eye upon them. Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying. The horse broke into a trot, and she smiled. Dothraki scrambled to clear a path. The slightest pressure with her legs, the lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded. She sent it into a gallop, and now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way. As she turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in her path. They were hemmed in on either side, with no room to stop. A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then, and she gave the filly her head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_939" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>银灰的小母马步伐平稳，轻盈如丝，众人让出路来，目光全集中在她身上。丹妮发现自己骑得远比料想的要快，而她感觉到的只有兴奋，并无恐惧。马儿开步小跑，她不禁笑了起来。多斯拉克人跌跌撞撞地让开。她只需双脚微微使力，轻轻一抖缰绳，母马便立即有回应。她催马飞奔，多斯拉克人纷纷闪开，一边对她又叫又笑。当她掉转马头，准备返回时，只见前方远处有个火堆。她们两边是人，无路可走。此刻丹妮莉丝心中突然有种前所未有的勇气，她把一切都交给小母马。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_941');"><p>When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio, she said, "Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind." The fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in Dothraki, and Dany saw her new husband smile for the first time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_941" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她在伊利里欧总督面前停下，说：“请告诉卓戈卡奥，他给了我风的力量。”这位肥胖的潘托斯人捻捻黄胡子，把她的话译为多斯拉克语，接着丹妮头一次看到她的新婚丈夫露出微笑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_942');"><p>The last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just then. Dany had lost all track of time. Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse, a lean red stallion. As the khal was saddling the horse, Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver, dug his fingers into her leg, and said, "Please him, sweet sister, or I swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before."
</p></origin><translate id="div_942" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在这时，夕阳的最后一抹余晖消失在潘托斯的高墙尽头。丹妮已完全没了时间概念。卓戈卡奥命令血盟卫们把他的坐骑牵来，那是匹精瘦的红色骏马。卡奥装配马鞍时，韦赛里斯闪到骑着银马的丹妮身边，伸出手指抠进她的大腿肉：“亲爱的好妹妹，你给我好好取悦他，否则我保证让你看看真正的唤醒睡龙是什么样子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_943');"><p>The fear came back to her then, with her brother’s words. She felt like a child once more, only thirteen and all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_943" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哥哥的这番话把恐惧又带了回来。她再度觉得自己像个小孩子，只有十三岁，孤零零的，对于即将发生在身上的事毫无准备。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_944');"><p>They rode out together as the stars came out, leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind. Khal Drogo spoke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk. The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode. "I am the blood of the dragon," she whispered aloud as she followed, trying to keep her courage up. "I am the blood of the dragon. I am the blood of the dragon." The dragon was never afraid.
</p></origin><translate id="div_944" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>星星出来的时候，他们一同骑马离开，将卡拉萨和草织宫殿抛在身后。卓戈卡奥一句话也没有说，径自催马狂奔，跑进愈加深沉的夜色。他长长发辪上的银铃一路轻声作响。“我是真龙传人，”她一边跟上，一边大声地对自己说，努力鼓起勇气。“我是真龙传人，我是真龙传人。”龙是不会害怕的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_945');"><p>Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream. Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers. She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, her limbs as weak as water. She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at her, she began to cry.
</p></origin><translate id="div_945" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>事后想来，她说不准他们究竟骑了多远，骑了多久，但当他们在一条小溪边的草地上停步时，天已经全黑。卓戈翻身下马，然后把她抱下来。在他手里，她觉得自己脆弱得好像玻璃，四肢无力犹如溺水。她穿着结婚礼服，站在原地颤抖，看他把马匹拴好，当他转头望她时，她的眼泪终于忍不住滑落。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_946');"><p>Khal Drogo stared at her tears, his face strangely empty of expression. "No," he said. He lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb.
</p></origin><translate id="div_946" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥看着她的泪水，脸上却奇怪地毫无表情。“不。”他抬起手，用长茧的拇指粗鲁地抹去她的泪水。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_947');"><p>"You speak the Common Tongue," Dany said in wonder.
</p></origin><translate id="div_947" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你会通用语？”丹妮惊奇地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_948');"><p>"No," he said again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_948" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不。”他又说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_949');"><p>Perhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than she had known he had, and somehow it made her feel a little better. Drogo touched her hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki. Dany did not understand the words, yet there was warmth in the tone, a tenderness she had never expected from this man.
</p></origin><translate id="div_949" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>或许他就只懂这个字，她心想，但总比她原先想像的要好得多，这稍稍安抚了她的情绪。卓戈轻触她的头发，一边用手抚弄她亮银色的发丝，一边用多斯拉克话喃喃自语。丹妮听不懂他在说些什么，然而话中却有种温暖的感觉，一种她原本不期待会在这个男人身上找到的温柔。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_950');"><p>He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up into his eyes. Drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone. Taking her lightly under the arms, he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream. Then he sat on the ground facing her, legs crossed beneath him, their faces finally at a height. "No," he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_950" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他伸出手指抚她下巴，托起她的头，让她直视他的双眼。与她相比，卓戈明显高出一大截，他比所有人都高出一截。他轻轻地自腋下抱起她，把她放在溪边的圆石上。然后他坐在地上，面对她，双脚盘坐，两人的脸终于处在同样高度。“不。”他说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_951');"><p>"Is that the only word you know?" she asked him.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_952');"><p>Drogo did not reply. His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him. He pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one by one. After a moment Dany leaned forward to help. When they were done, Drogo gestured. She understood. Slowly, carefully, she began to undo his braid.
</p></origin><translate id="div_952" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈没有回答。他又长又重的辪子在身旁的泥土地上缠绕成圈。他将辪子拉过右肩，开始一个一个解下铃铛。过了一会儿，丹妮也靠过去帮他。全部完成之后，卓戈做了个手势。这次她看懂了，便小心翼翼地为他缓缓松开辪子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_953');"><p>It took a long time. All the while he sat there silently, watching her. When she was done, he shook his head, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness, oiled and gleaming. She had never seen hair so long, so black, so thick.
</p></origin><translate id="div_953" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她花了好长时间。在这期间，他始终静静地坐在原地，凝望着她。她完成之后，他甩甩头，乌黑油亮的头发便如一条黑暗的河流般在他身后泼洒开来。她从未见过这么长、这么黑、这么厚实的头发。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_954');"><p>Then it was his turn. He began to undress her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_954" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然后轮到他了。他开始为她宽衣解带。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_955');"><p>His fingers were deft and strangely tender. He removed her silks one by one, carefully, while Dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her small breasts, she could not help herself. She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands. "No," Drogo said. He pulled her hands away from her breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. "No," he repeated.
</p></origin><translate id="div_955" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的手指不仅灵敏、而且出奇温柔。他轻缓地为她脱去一件件丝臼礼服，丹妮一动也不动地静静坐着，凝望他的双眸。当她小小的乳房暴露出来时，她实在克臸不住，下意识地伸手遮挡，并将视线转开。“不。”卓戈说。他把她遮住胸部的手拿开，温柔而坚定，然后他再度抬起她的脸，让她看着他。“不。”他重复。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_956');"><p>"No," she echoed back at him.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_957');"><p>He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks. The night air was chilly on her bare skin. She shivered, and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs. She was afraid of what would come next, but for a while nothing happened. Khal Drogo sat with his legs crossed, looking at her, drinking in her body with his eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_957" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他扶她站起，将她拉近，为她除去身上最后一件丝衣。夜风寒冷，凉如冰水，吹在赤裸的肌肤上，令她不禁颤抖，手脚也冒出鸡皮疙瘩。她很害怕接下来会发生的事，但她等了好久，什么也没有发生。卓戈卡奥仍旧双腿盘坐，定定地望着她，用眼睛享受她的躯体。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_958');"><p>After a while he began to touch her. Lightly at first, then harder. She could sense the fierce strength in his hands, but he never hurt her. He held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers, one by one. He ran a hand gently down her leg. He stroked her face, tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently around her mouth. He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. He turned her around, massaged her shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine.
</p></origin><translate id="div_958" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>又过了一会儿，他开始抚摸她。起初非常轻微，然后稍稍用力。她可以感觉出他手臂里蕴藏的力量，但他始终没有弄痛她。他握住她的手，抚弄她的指头，一根又一根。他爱抚她的脸颊，沿着耳朵的曲线，一根手指轻轻绕着她的嘴巴。他将双手伸进她的头发，用手指为她梳头，接着把她转过身去，按摩她的肩膀，指节沿着脊椎往下滑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_959');"><p>It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. He stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his thumbs, pinched them between thumb and forefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then more insistently, until her nipples stiffened and began to ache.
</p></origin><translate id="div_959" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>似乎又过了好久，他才将手伸向她的乳房。他抚摸着乳房下方的部位，直到她浑身发麻，又用拇指绕着乳头转，拿拇指和食指轻轻夹住，然后向外拉，起初非常轻微，随后渐渐加重，直到她乳头发硬，开始疼痛。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_960');"><p>He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes. "No?" he said, and she knew it was a question.
</p></origin><translate id="div_960" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时他停了下来，把她拉进怀里。丹妮面红耳赤，喘气不止，心脏狂跳。他用那双巨掌托起她的脸，两人四目相交。“不？”他说。她听懂这是个问句。
