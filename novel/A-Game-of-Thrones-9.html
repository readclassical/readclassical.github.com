</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_668');"><p>The hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey rode with his father, so Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, and even the queen’s funny little brother had all ridden out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the morrow they left for the south.
</p></origin><translate id="div_668" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>打猎的队伍于黎明启程，国王希望能为今天的晚宴多添一道野熊大餐。因为乔佛里王子与国王同行，所以罗柏也得到允许，跟着狩猎队伍一同前往。班扬叔叔、乔里、席恩•葛雷乔伊和罗德利克爵士他们都跟着一道去，就连王后的滑稽小弟也在队伍中。毕竟这是他们在北方最后的打猎机会，明天，国王的队伍就要动身南下。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_669');"><p>Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He thought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. He was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Night’s Watch. That was almost as good as going south with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_669" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰和琼恩、姐姐们以及瑞肯留在城里。瑞肯只是个小娃娃，女孩子们本来就不喜欢打猎，而琼恩和他的小狼则跑得不见踪影。布兰也没有努力去找他，因为他觉得琼恩似乎在生自己的气。琼恩这几天似乎在生城里每一个人的气，布兰很纳闷，他要和班扬叔叔到长城去加入守夜人军团，那可不是和跟国王南下一样的好事吗？要留在家里的人是罗柏，不是琼恩呀。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_670');"><p>For days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the red castle at King’s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? His father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords.
</p></origin><translate id="div_670" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这几天来，布兰兴奋得坐立不安。他很快就要在国王大道上策马驰骋了，不是骑小马喔，而是骑真正的骏马。父亲将成为国王的首相，他们会搬进君临，住进龙王建造的“红堡”. 老奶妈说那里闹鬼，地牢里有不为人知的恐怖酷刑，墙上还挂着龙头。布兰光想想就浑身打颤，但他却不害怕，有什么好怕的呢？他有父亲保护，还有国王和他所有的骑士与宣誓效忠的武士呢。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_671');"><p>Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another’s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.
</p></origin><translate id="div_671" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>有朝一日布兰自己也要当骑士，加入国王的御林铁卫。老奶妈说他们是全国最优秀的战士。御林铁卫一共只有七人，身穿白衣白甲，没有任何家室牵累，活着的惟一目的就是守护国王。关于他们的故事布兰早就听得滚瓜烂熟，倒背如流了：“镜盾”萨文，莱安•雷德温爵士，龙骑士伊蒙王子，几百年前死在对方剑下的孪生兄弟伊利克爵士和亚历克爵士——那是一场骨肉相残，姐弟交战，被后世吟游诗人称为“血龙狂舞”的战争，还有“白牛”杰洛•海陶尔，“拂晓神剑”亚瑟•戴恩爵士，以及“无畏的”巴利斯坦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_672');"><p>Two of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert. Bran had watched them with fascination, never quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the stories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn’t count anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they reached King’s Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine.
</p></origin><translate id="div_672" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这次有两名御林铁卫和劳勃国王一同北来，布兰瞠目结舌地看着他们，始终不敢上前攀谈。柏洛斯爵士是个秃了顶、双下巴的人，马林爵士则两眼低垂，须如铁锈。只有詹姆•兰尼斯特爵士看起来比较像故事里的伟大骑士，他也是七铁卫之一，不过罗柏说他杀了疯狂的老王，已经不能算御林铁卫了。如今世上最伟大的骑士是巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士，人称“无畏的”巴利斯坦，他是御林铁卫队长。父亲答应过他们，等抵达君临之后，一定会让他们见见巴利斯坦爵士。布兰每天在墙上画记号数日子，迫不及待想动身出发，去看看一个以往只存在于梦中的世界，过另一种从来无法想像的生活。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_673');"><p>Yet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the only home he had ever known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the hunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones who would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but "Hodor," the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_673" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可现在离出发只剩一天，布兰却突然若有所失起来。临冬城是他惟一熟悉的家园，父亲叮嘱他今天要向大家道别，他也尽力去试。打猎队伍离开后，他带着小狼在城堡里闲逛，打算和熟人们一个个说再见。老奶妈、厨师盖吉，铁匠密肯，还有负责帮他照顾小马，成天咧着嘴笑，除了“阿多”两个字以外，一句话也不会讲的马夫阿多。每次布兰去玻璃花园玩，阿多总会给他一颗黑莓。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_674');"><p>But it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn’t his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the godswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in his father’s kennel and Bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks.
</p></origin><translate id="div_674" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但他开不了口。他先去了马厩，看到自己的小马，只是现在已经不属于他了。他很快便会拥有一匹真正的马，而把小马留在这里，突然间布兰好想坐下来放声大哭，于是他赶紧跑开，以免阿多和其他马夫见到他眼中的泪水。他总共就说了这么一次再见，之后便一早上独自躲在神木林里，教他的小狼把丢出去的树枝叼回来，却徒劳无功。他的小狼比父亲兽舍里所有的猎狗都要聪明，他几乎可以肯定他听得懂他说的每一句话。只可惜他对叼树枝似乎没多少兴趣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_675');"><p>He was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon’s wolf, the white one, was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn’t white. He had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right.
</p></origin><translate id="div_675" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他到现在还无法决定给它取什么名字。罗柏的狼叫做“灰风”，因为它跑起来迅捷如风；珊莎的叫做“淑女”；艾莉亚用歌谣里某个古老的女巫王为她的狼命名；小瑞肯则把他的狼叫做“毛毛狗”——布兰觉得给冰原狼起这种名字实在很蠢；琼恩的那只白狼叫白灵。布兰真希望自己比琼恩先想到这个名字，即使他的狼毛色不是很白。过去这两周以来，他不知道已经想过多少名字了，偏偏就是没一个听来顺耳。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_676');"><p>Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn’t been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance.
</p></origin><translate id="div_676" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>最后他累了，便决定去爬墙。最近发生了这么多事情，他已经好几个星期没爬到残塔上玩了，这说不定还是他最后的机会呢。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_677');"><p>He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. "You stay here," he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall. "Lie down. That’s right. Now stay..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_677" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是他拔腿跑过神木林，还特地绕路避开心树旁边的那泓冷泉。布兰一直很怕心树，他总觉得树不应该长眼睛，叶子也不该生成手掌的模样。小狼跟在他身边。“你留在这儿。”他在武器库墙外哨兵树下对它说，“乖乖躺下，对，就这样，留在这儿别动——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_678');"><p>The wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl.
</p></origin><translate id="div_678" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小狼果然乖乖地留在原地，布兰搔了搔它的耳后根，然后转身一跃，抓住低垂的枝干，一翻身便上了树。可当他爬到一半，正游刃有余地穿梭枝丫时，小狼却霍地起身嗥叫开来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_679');"><p>Bran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes. A strange chill went through him. He began to climb again. Once more the wolf howled. "Quiet," he yelled. "Sit down. Stay. You’re worse than Mother." The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_679" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰低头一看，小狼便立刻安静，睁大那双亮闪闪的黄色眼珠往上瞧。布兰觉得有股诡异的寒意流贯全身。他继续爬，小狼又继续嗥。“别叫啦！”他喊，“乖乖坐好别动，你比妈还烦。”然而狼嗥却一直跟随着他，直到他跳上武器库屋顶，消失了踪影为止。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_680');"><p>The rooftops of Winterfell were Bran’s second home. His mother often said that Bran could climb before he could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he could not remember when he started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true.
</p></origin><translate id="div_680" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>临冬城的屋顶几乎可算是布兰的第二个家，母亲总说他连走路都还没学会，就先学会爬墙啦。布兰既不记得自己什么时候学会走路，也不知道自己什么时候学会爬墙，所以他猜她说得应该没错。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_681');"><p>To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn’t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_681" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>对一个小男孩而言，临冬城的城墙高塔、庭院甬道就像是座灰石砌成的广袤迷宫。在城堡比较老旧的部分，无数厅堂四处倾斜，容易让人产生不知置身何处之感。鲁温学士曾说，几千年来，城堡就像一棵不断蔓生的怪物般的石头巨树，枝干扭曲，盘根错节。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_682');"><p>When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a glance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.
</p></origin><translate id="div_682" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当布兰穿过错综复杂的倾颓古城，爬到接近天空的地方，全城的景致终于一览无遗。他很喜欢临冬城在他面前展开的辽阔样貌，城堡里的一切熙来攘往、人声喧哗都在他脚下，惟有天际飞鸟在头上盘旋。布兰往往就这样趴在首堡之上，置身在形状早已不复辨识、被风霜雨雪摧残殆尽的石像鬼间，俯瞡下方的城间百态。看着广场上拖运木材和钢铁的长工，看着玻璃花园里采集菜蔬的厨师，看着犬舍里来回奔跑、局促不安的猎狗，看着静默无语的神木林，看着深井边交头接耳的女侍，仿佛他才是城堡真正的主人，即使罗柏也无法体会这种境界。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_683');"><p>It taught him Winterfell’s secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn’t know that, Bran was convinced.
</p></origin><translate id="div_683" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他也因此挖掘出临冬城许多不为人知的秘密，比如当初建筑工人并没有把城堡附近的地势铲平，所以城墙外面不但有起伏丘陵，还有溪涧峡谷。布兰知道一座密闭的桥道，可以从钟塔的四楼直接通鸦巢的二层。他还知道如何从南门进入内城墙里边，顺着门梯爬三层，便能找到一条狭窄的石砌甬道，它可以绕行临冬城，最后抵达位于百尺高墙阴影下的北门底层。布兰相信就连鲁温师傅也不知道这条捷径。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_684');"><p>His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told her that he wouldn’t, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground. He had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep.
</p></origin><translate id="div_684" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>母亲一直很害怕布兰哪天会不小心滑下来，失足摔死。任他再三保证，她却怎么也不肯相信。有次她强迫他发誓不再往高处爬，结果这个诺言只勉强维持了两个星期，他每天都痛苦无比，最后有一天夜里，趁他兄弟熟睡的时候，他还是爬出了卧房窗户。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_685');"><p>He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience. The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen. They finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove.
</p></origin><translate id="div_685" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>翌日他满怀罪恶感地自行招认，艾德公爵叫他独自去神木林忏悔，还派了守卫监视，以确保他整晚都在林子里反省他不听话的行为。没想到第二天清晨，布兰却不见踪影，最后众人是在林间最高的一棵哨兵树的上层枝干找到睡得正香甜的他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_686');"><p>As angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. "You’re not my son," he told Bran when they fetched him down, "you’re a squirrel. So be it. If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your mother see you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_686" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>尽管父亲气得半死，终于还是忍不住笑道：“你一定不是我儿子，”当其他人把布兰抱下来时，他对儿子说，“你根本是只松鼠。算了，我认了，如果你真的非爬不可，那就去爬吧，尽量别让你母亲瞧见就是。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_687');"><p>Bran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her. Since his father would not forbid it, she turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not impressed. There were crows’ nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand. None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_687" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>布兰很努力，虽然他认为母亲对他的举动其实一清二楚。既然父亲不愿阻止他四处攀爬，她便转而采取迂回策略。首先来的是老奶妈，她跟他讲了一个故事，说从前有个不听话的坏小孩，越爬越高，最后被雷活活劈死，死后乌鸦还来啄他眼睛。布兰听了不为所动，因为残塔上多的是乌鸦窠巢，那里除了他没人会去，所以有时他会在口袋里装满玉米。一上塔顶，乌鸦便都开开心心地聚拢来从他手心啄食，怎么也不像会啄他眼睛的模样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_688');"><p>Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran’s clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, "I’m not made of clay. And anyhow, I never fall."
</p></origin><translate id="div_688" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>眼看这招无效，鲁温师傅便用陶土捏了个小男孩，为它穿上布兰的衣服，然后从城墙上丢下去，好让布兰了解他若是摔下，会有多么凄惨的结果。那是个有趣的实验，但事后布兰却只盯着鲁温师傅，面无表情地说：“我不是泥做的，而且我绝对不会摔下去。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_689');"><p>Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him down. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a game with his brothers, except that Bran always won. None of the guards could climb half so well as Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never saw him anyway. People never looked up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost like being invisible.
</p></origin><translate id="div_689" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在此之后，轮到了城里的守卫，有一段时间，只要他们发现他在屋顶上，就会吆喝追赶，想把他赶下来。那是最紧张刺激的时刻了，简直就像和哥哥弟弟们玩游戏，只不过，这游戏每次都是布兰获胜。卫兵们谁也没有布兰这种本事，连乔里也拿他没辙。不过多数时候他们根本就没看见他，人是从来不往上看的。这也是他喜欢爬墙的原因之一，仿佛可以因此隐身遁形。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_690');"><p>He liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between. He always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed; it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. He liked the way the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the crows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_690" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他很喜欢攀爬时那种一石高过一石，手脚并用，聚精会神的感觉。每次他都先把靴子脱掉，然后光着脚丫爬墙，如此一来让他觉得自己多出两只手。他喜欢每次事后浑身肌肉那种疲累却甜丝丝的酸疼；喜欢高处清冽的空气，冰冷甘美宛如冬雪甜桃；喜欢各式各样的鸟类，包括群聚残塔上的大乌鸦，筑巢乱石间的小麻雀和栖息在旧武器库积满灰尘阁楼里的老夜枭。布兰对这些事物通通了如指掌。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_691');"><p>Most of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Bran’s secret place.
</p></origin><translate id="div_691" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>不过他最喜欢的还是登上人迹罕至的地方，看着城堡以一种不曾为他人展示的样貌，在眼前灰蒙蒙地呈现出来。整座临冬城似乎都因此成了布兰的秘密基地。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_692');"><p>His favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for Bran and the crows.
</p></origin><translate id="div_692" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他对曾是临冬城最高了望台的残塔情有独钟。很久很久以前，在他父亲出生前约一百年，高塔遭暴雷击中，起火燃烧，顶端三分之一的建筑朝塔内崩塌，自此以后始终没有重建。父亲偶尔会派人进到残塔底层清理断垣残壁间的老鼠窝，然而除了布兰和乌鸦，从来没有人登上过塔顶废墟。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_693');"><p>He knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full weight on them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_693" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他知道两种登上塔顶的途径，一是直接从残塔外围爬上去，但是由于当年刷的泥浆早已干燥风化，砖石容易松落，因此布兰爬的时候不太敢把重心放在上面。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_694');"><p>The best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn’t hear you overhead. That brought you up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked. Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. You could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From there, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close. The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, and then the crows would come round to see if you’d brought any corn.
</p></origin><translate id="div_694" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>最好的方法还是从神木林出发，爬上高高的哨兵树，从武器库的屋顶跳到守卫室的屋顶，其间光着脚以免守卫听见，如此便可顺利抵达城中最古老的首堡后方。那是座低矮的圆形堡垒，其实它比乍看上去要高得多。如今堡内虽只有老鼠和蜘蛛，但当年建筑的古老石块仍旧提供了攀爬的最佳场所。你甚至可以直接爬到眼神空洞的石像鬼雕像驻守的空旷高台，两手勾紧，从这个石像鬼悬荡到那个石像鬼，随后抵达城楼北端。接着，只要全力伸展，便可够到倾斜的残塔。最后的部分只是翻越焦黑的乱石堆登上养鹰楼，爬不到十尺，乌鸦群便会竞相迎接，看你有没有带玉米粒给它们了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_695');"><p>Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices. He was so startled he almost lost his grip. The First Keep had been empty all his life.
</p></origin><translate id="div_695" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这天布兰一如往常，驾轻就熟地在石像鬼雕像间荡来荡去，不料却听到说话的声音。他吓得差点松手，首堡向来是个人迹罕至的地方呀！ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_696');"><p>"I do not like it," a woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath him, and the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side. "You should be the Hand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_696" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不喜欢这样，”有个女人的声音说。布兰下方有一排窗户，声音是从最后一扇窗里传出来的，“当首相的该是你才对。”

The man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting her there, because the woman started to moan, low in her throat. "Stop it," she said, "stop it, stop it. Oh, please?.?.?.?" But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast.
</p></origin><translate id="div_729" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>屋内有种细小而濡湿的声音，布兰发觉他们正在亲嘴。他张大眼睛，呼吸急促，惊恐地看着房里发生的这一切。男人伸手到女人两腿间，他一定弄痛了她，因为女人开始低声呻吟：“别……别这样，”她说，“住手，住手，噢，求求你……”可她的声音细小微弱，又始终没有把他推开。她反而把双手埋进他凌乱的亮金色头发里，把他的脸往自己胸前拉。

Bran tried to pull himself up, bending double as he reached for the gargoyle. He was in too much of a hurry. His hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone, and in his panic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. There was an instant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. He shot out a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught it again with his other hand. He swung against the building, hard. The impact took the breath out of him. Bran dangled, one-handed, panting.
