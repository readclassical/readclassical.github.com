</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2290');"><p>Jon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard. "Your feet should be farther apart," he urged. "You don’t want to lose your balance. That’s good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2290" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那个新兵走进训练场时，琼恩正在向戴利恩示范侧劈的诀窍。“两脚要张开一点，”他叮嘱道，“以免重心不稳，对，就是这样。出手的时候身体旋转，把全部的重心放在剑上。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2291');"><p>Dareon broke off and lifted his visor. "Seven gods," he murmured. "Would you look at this, Jon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2291" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>戴利恩停了下来，掀开面罩。“诸神在上，”他喃喃道，“琼恩，你快瞧瞧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2292');"><p>Jon turned. Through the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory. By the look of him, he must have weighed twenty stone. The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins. Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face, and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet. "They ?.?.?.?they told me I was to come here for?.?.?.?for training," he said to no one in particular.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2292" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩转身，隔着头盔的细窄眼缝，他看到了他平生所见最为肥胖的男孩站在兵器库门口。单凭目测，他大概有二十石重，肥大的下巴完全遮掩住刺绣外套的绒毛领口，圆滚滚的月亮脸上一对苍白的眼睛局促地四下转动，汗水淋漓的肥胖指头则在天鹅绒上衣上揩个不停。“他……他们叫我来这边……受训。”他不确定地道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2293');"><p>"A lordling," Pyp observed to Jon. "Southron, most like near Highgarden." Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers’ troupe, and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you’d been born just from the sound of your voice.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2293" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“公子哥儿一个，”派普对琼恩说，“南方来的，八成是高庭一带的人。”派普曾经跟着戏班走辫七国全境，自称凭口音便能分辨别人来自何方，操什么营生。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2294');"><p>A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy’s fur-trimmed surcoat. Jon did not recognize the sigil. Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said, "It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us pigs to man the Wall. Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2294" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>胖男孩穿着绒毛滚边的外套，胸前用鲜红丝线绣着一个大跨步的猎人。琼恩不认得这个家徽。只见艾里沙•索恩爵士望了望他的新手下说：“看来这年头南方连盗猎者和小偷都人手短缺，这会儿倒把猪送来防守长城啦。我说火腿大人，这身毛皮和天鹅绒敢情就是您的铠甲了？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2295');"><p>It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet, boiled leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat. As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory. That took half the morning. His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides. To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor. His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move. Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin. "Let us hope you are not as inept as you look," Ser Alliser said. "Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2295" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>众人很快便发现这新兵自己带来了全套行头：加衬垫的上衣，煮过的硬皮甲，铁铠和头盔，还有个包皮的大木盾，上面同样刻着他衣服上那个健步猎人纹章。由于这身装备没一件是黑的，艾里沙爵士便坚持要那新兵到武器库去换一套。这一换就是半早上。因为他的腰围太粗，唐纳•诺伊只好拆开整件胸甲，再帮他前后套上，两边用皮绳捆祝为了帮他戴上头盔，面罩便保不祝他的皮护手和绑腿紧紧地绑在四肢上，使他几乎动弹不得。全副武装之后，新来的小子看起来活像条煮得过熟的香肠，随时可能爆开。“希望你不像看起来那么不中用，”艾里沙爵士道，“霍德，试试猪头爵士有多厉害。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2296');"><p>Jon Snow winced. Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason. He was sixteen, tall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt. "This will be uglier than a whore’s ass," Pyp muttered, and it was.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2296" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩•雪诺听了立刻皱起眉头。霍德在采石场里出生，当过石匠的学徒，今年十六岁，高大又结实，打起人来下手很重，琼恩还没尝过更厉害的拳头。“这下有人要他妈的倒大霉了。”派普喃喃道，事情果真如他所料。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2297');"><p>The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers. "I yield," he shrilled. "No more, I yield, don’t hit me." Rast and some of the other boys were laughing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2297" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>打斗不到一分钟就告结束。胖子倒在地上，血从碎掉的头盔和肥短的手指间流出来，他全身都在颤抖。“我投降，”他尖叫，“别打了，我投降，不要打我。”雷斯特和其他几个男孩哄笑成一团。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2298');"><p>Even then, Ser Alliser would not call an end. "On your feet, Ser Piggy," he called. "Pick up your sword." When the boy continued to cling to the ground, Thorne gestured to Halder. "Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet." Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe’s upraised cheeks. "You can hit harder than that," Thorne taunted. Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat. The new boy screeched in pain.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2298" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>即便如此，艾里沙爵士还是不肯罢休。“猪头爵士，给我起来，”他叫道，“把剑捡起来。”眼看胖子还是躺在地上，索恩向霍德示意，“拿剑脊揍他，直到他爬起来为止。”霍德试探性地敲敲对手仰高的脸颊。“你该不会就这点力气罢？”索恩讥讽。霍德于是双手持剑，狠狠地砍将下去，力道之猛，虽然是用剑脊，皮甲还是应声破裂。新兵痛苦地哀嚎。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2299');"><p>Jon Snow took a step forward. Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm. "Jon, no," the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2299" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩跨前一步，派普忙伸出戴护套的手抓住他。“琼恩，不要冲动。”小个子一边紧张地瞄了艾里沙•索恩爵士一眼，一边悄声对他说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2300');"><p>"On your feet," Thorne repeated. The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and fell heavily again. "Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion," Ser Alliser observed. "Again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2300" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还不快给我起来。”索恩又说。胖男孩挣扎着想起身，谁知竟滑了一跤，又重重地摔倒在地。“猪头爵士有进步啰。”艾里沙爵士说，“再打。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2301');"><p>Halder lifted the sword for another blow. "Cut us off a ham!" Rast urged, laughing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2301" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>霍德举起剑准备继续。“给我们切块火腿唷！”雷斯特狞笑着催促他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2302');"><p>Jon shook off Pyp’s hand. "Halder, enough."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2302" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩甩开派普的手。“霍德，够了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2303');"><p>Halder looked to Ser Alliser.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2303" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>霍德转头去看艾里沙爵士。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2304');"><p>"The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble," the master-at-arms said in that sharp, cold voice of his. "I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2304" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“野种出来为农民打抱不平啦？”教头用他那尖锐而冷酷的声音说，“雪诺大人，你别忘了，我才是这里的头儿。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2305');"><p>"Look at him, Halder," Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could. "There’s no honor in beating a fallen foe. He yielded." He knelt beside the fat boy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2305" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“霍德，你看看他，”琼恩劝促道，故意不理睬索恩。“人家都投降了，你这样趁火打劫有什么意义？”他在胖子身旁蹲了下来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2306');"><p>Halder lowered his sword. "He yielded," he echoed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2306" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>霍德放下剑。“他投降了，”他跟着重复。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2307');"><p>Ser Alliser’s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow. "It would seem our Bastard is in love," he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet. "Show me your steel, Lord Snow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2307" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾里沙爵士黑玛瑙似的眼睛紧紧盯着琼恩•雪诺不放。“我说哪，原来咱们野种谈恋爱啦。”他边看着琼恩扶起胖子边说，“雪诺大人，亮剑。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2308');"><p>Jon drew his longsword. He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and he feared he was well beyond it now.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2308" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩抽出长剑，他只敢反抗艾里沙爵士到某种程度，而他暗自担心这回做得太过火了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2309');"><p>Thorne smiled. "The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it. Rat, Pimple, help our Stone Head here." Rast and Albett moved to join Halder. "Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal. All you need do is get past the Bastard."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2309" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>索恩微笑道：“野种打算为他心爱的小姐而战，所以我们得好好打一场。小老鼠、雀斑男，你们跟大笨头一边。”雷斯特和阿贝特走到霍德旁边。“你们三个人应该够猪小姐受的了。但首先，你们要打发掉挡路的野种。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2310');"><p>"Stay behind me," Jon said to the fat boy. Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him, but never three. He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight. He braced himself for the assault.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2310" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“躲在我背后。”琼恩对胖子说。艾里沙爵士常叫两人打他一个，但从来没有三对一。他自知今晚上床时大概会伤痕累累。于是他屏气凝神，准备大干一场。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2311');"><p>Suddenly Pyp was beside him. "Three to two will make for better sport," the small boy said cheerfully. He dropped his visor and slid out his sword. Before Jon could even think to protest, Grenn had stepped up to make a third.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2311" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派普突然出现在他身边。“我想三打二应该会更精彩。”小个子开心地说。他放下面罩，抽出佩剑。琼恩还来不及抗议，葛兰也走上前来加入他们。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2312');"><p>The yard had grown deathly quiet. Jon could feel Ser Alliser’s eyes. "Why are you waiting?" he asked Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft, but it was Jon who moved first. Halder barely got his sword up in time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2312" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>整个广场顿时一片死寂。琼恩感觉得出艾里沙爵士的眼神。“你们还等什么？”他用轻得吓人的声音问雷斯特和其他人，然而最先出手的却是琼恩，霍德差点就不及举剑格挡。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2313');"><p>Jon drove him backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels. Know your foe, Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Halder, brutally strong but short of patience, with no taste for defense. Frustrate him, and he would leave himself open, as certain as sunset.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2313" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩不断进攻，逼得这个年长的男孩节节后退。要了解你的敌人，罗德利克爵士曾经这么教他，而琼恩很了解霍德，他壮得惊人，但缺乏耐心，向来不惯防守。只要想办法激怒他，他自会门户洞开，破绽百出。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2314');"><p>The clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him. Jon blocked a savage cut at his head, the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together. He slammed a sidestroke into Halder’s ribs, and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain. The counterstroke caught Jon on the shoulder. Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up his neck, but for an instant Halder was unbalanced. Jon cut his left leg from under him, and he fell with a curse and a crash.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2314" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时其他人也加入战局，刀剑交击声刹时响彻广常琼恩挡下一记照头挥来的猛击，力道之大震得他手臂酸麻。他一记侧劈打中霍德的肋骨，只听对方一声闷哼，随即反手砍中琼恩肩膀。锁甲铿锵一声，疼痛直逼脖颈，但霍德也暂时重心不稳，于是琼恩猛力扫他左腿，他咒骂着轰然倒地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2315');"><p>Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him, giving Albett more than he cared for, but Pyp was hard-pressed. Rast had two years and forty pounds on him. Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper’s helm like a bell. As Rast went reeling, Pyp slid in under his guard, knocked him down, and leveled a blade at his throat. By then Jon had moved on. Facing two swords, Albett backed away. "I yield," he shouted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2315" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>葛兰依照琼恩教他的诀窍，稳稳地守住阵脚，让阿贝特大感头痛，但派普就没这么好过了。雷斯特大他两岁，又比他重上四十磅，所以他打得很吃力。琼恩闪到雷斯特身后，大力一挥，将这强奸犯的头盔当铃铛敲打，眼看雷斯特头晕眼花，派普乘机突破防线，将他击倒，然后举剑顶着他的喉咙。这时琼恩早已转换阵地，阿贝特一看自己陷入以一打二的劣势，急忙退后叫道：“我投降。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2316');"><p>Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust. "The mummer’s farce has gone on long enough for today." He walked away. The session was at an end.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2316" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾里沙•索恩爵士一脸嫌恶地环视全场：“你们这些小鬼耍把戏也耍得太久了，今天就到此为止。”说完他走开去，当日的练习便告结束。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2317');"><p>Dareon helped Halder to his feet. The quarryman’s son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard. "For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2317" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>戴利恩扶霍德起身，采石匠的儿子摘下头盔狠狠地摔到广场对面。“雪诺，刚才那一刹那，我还以为逮到你破绽了呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2318');"><p>"For an instant, you did," Jon replied. Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing. He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his teeth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2318" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯，但只有那一刹那。”琼恩回答。覆盖在护甲和皮革下的肩膀隐隐作痛，他收起剑，想取下头盔，但刚抬手就痛得龇牙咧嘴。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2319');"><p>"Let me," a voice said. Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently. "Did he hurt you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2319" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“让我来。”一个声音说。粗厚的手指解开他喉咙的皮带，轻轻地捧起头盔。“伤得严重吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2320');"><p>"I’ve been bruised before." He touched his shoulder and winced. The yard was emptying around them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2320" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不是第一次了。”他摸摸肩膀，皱紧眉头，广场上除了他们几个一片空旷。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2321');"><p>Blood matted the fat boy’s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder. "My name is Samwell Tarly, of Horn?.?.?.?" He stopped and licked his lips. "I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I?.?.?.?left. I’ve come to take the black. My father is Lord Randyll, a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden. I used to be his heir, only?.?.?.?" His voice trailed off.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2321" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>胖男孩的发际有凝固的血块，正是刚才霍德砍裂头盔的地方。“我是山姆威尔•塔利，来自角……”他停下来舔舔嘴，“我的意思是……那是我……我 ‘曾经’是角陵塔利家族的人。我前来加入黑衫军，家父是蓝道伯爵，高庭提利尔家族的封臣。我本来是爵位继承人，不过……”他没有说下去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2322');"><p>"I’m Jon Snow, Ned Stark’s bastard, of Winterfell."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2322" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我是琼恩•雪诺，临冬城公爵奈德•史塔克的私生子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2323');"><p>Samwell Tarly nodded. "I?.?.?.?if you want, you can call me Sam. My mother calls me Sam."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2323" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆威尔•塔利点点头。“我……如果你愿意的话，可以叫我山姆，我妈都这样叫我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2324');"><p>"You can call him Lord Snow," Pyp said as he came up to join them. "You don’t want to know what his mother calls him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2324" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你呢，则要尊称他雪诺大人，”派普边说边凑过来。“你不会想知道他妈怎么叫他的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2325');"><p>"These two are Grenn and Pypar," Jon said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2325" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这两位是葛兰和派普。”琼恩说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2326');"><p>"Grenn’s the ugly one," Pyp said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2326" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“长得丑的是葛兰。”派普道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2327');"><p>Grenn scowled. "You’re uglier than me. At least I don’t have ears like a bat."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2327" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>葛兰一脸不悦地说：“你比我丑咧，起码我没生一对蝙蝠耳。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2328');"><p>"My thanks to all of you," the fat boy said gravely.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2328" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我衷心地感谢你们。”胖男孩正色道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2329');"><p>"Why didn’t you get up and fight?" Grenn demanded.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2329" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“刚才你怎么不站起来反击啊？”葛兰问他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2330');"><p>"I wanted to, truly. I just?.?.?.?I couldn’t. I didn’t want him to hit me anymore." He looked at the ground. "I?.?.?.?I fear I’m a coward. My lord father always said so."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2330" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我也想，真的，可我……我就是做不到。我也不想一直被揍。”他看看地面，“我……我猜我是窝囊废一个，家父常这么说。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2331');"><p>Grenn looked thunderstruck. Even Pyp had no words to say to that, and Pyp had words for everything. What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward?
</p></origin><translate id="div_2331" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>葛兰的表情如遭雷击，就连派普也说不出话来，而他一向对任何事情都爱发表意见。怎么会有人自称窝囊废呢？ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2332');"><p>Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces. His eyes met Jon’s and darted away, quick as frightened animals. "I?.?.?.?I’m sorry," he said. "I don’t mean to?.?.?.?to be like I am." He walked heavily toward the armory.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2332" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆威尔•塔利想必是从他们脸上读出了他们的想法，他的视线刚碰到琼恩的眼睛，随即像受惊的动物般转开。“我……对不起，”他说，“我……也不想这样的。”他沉重地走向武器库。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2333');"><p>Jon called after him. "You were hurt," he said. "Tomorrow you’ll do better."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2333" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩叫住他。“你受伤了，”他说，“明天你就会进步的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2334');"><p>Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder. "No I won’t," he said, blinking back tears. "I never do better."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2334" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆一脸哀怨地回过头。“才不会，”他强忍泪水说，“我永远都不会进步。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2335');"><p>When he was gone, Grenn frowned. "Nobody likes cravens," he said uncomfortably. "I wish we hadn’t helped him. What if they think we’re craven too?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2335" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等他走后，葛兰皱起眉头。“胆小鬼人人讨厌，”他很不舒服地说，“早知道咱们就不帮他了。要是别人把咱们也当胆小鬼那还得了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2336');"><p>"You’re too stupid to be craven," Pyp told him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2336" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你太笨啦，当不成胆小鬼的。”派普告诉他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2337');"><p>"I am not," Grenn said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2337" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我才不笨。”葛兰说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2338');"><p>"Yes you are. If a bear attacked you in the woods, you’d be too stupid to run away."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2338" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你笨死了。要在树林里遇到大熊，你都不会跑哟。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2339');"><p>"I would not," Grenn insisted. "I’d run away faster than you." He stopped suddenly, scowling when he saw Pyp’s grin and realized what he’d just said. His thick neck flushed a dark red. Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2339" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我当然会跑，”葛兰坚持，“而且跑得比你快。”他看到派普嘻皮笑脸，赶紧住口，这才恍然大悟，气得脸红脖子粗。琼恩让他们吵个痛快，自己走回武器库，挂回佩剑，脱下一身伤痕累累的铠甲。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2340');"><p>Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for swordplay, the afternoons for work. The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where their skills lay. Jon cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the Lord Commander’s table, but for every day spent hunting, he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the armory, spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use, or pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword. Other times he ran messages, stood at guard, mucked out stables, fletched arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his counts and inventories.

It was lonely and boring work, even with Ghost along for company, but Jon found he did not mind. On a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the Wall, and the air was always cold and bracing. He could think here, and he found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly?.?.?.?and, oddly, of Tyrion Lannister. He wondered what Tyrion would have made of the fat boy. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, the dwarf had told him, grinning. The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had.

A group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire. His friends were at the bench nearest the west wall, laughing. Pyp was in the middle of a story. The mummer’s boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices, and he did not tell his tales so much as live them, playing all the parts as needed, a king one moment and a swineherd the next. When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess, he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter, and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser.

Most nights it’s my father, but sometimes it’s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle." The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing. The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of him. Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower, but they’d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way.

He had never told anyone of the dream, and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it. "Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones. That always scares me. I start to run then, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone. And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It’s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don’t want to. I’m afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it’s not them I’m afraid of. I scream that I’m not a Stark, that this isn’t my place, but it’s no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream." He stopped, frowning, embarrassed. "That’s when I always wake." His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his cell. Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak. He would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur. "Do you dream of Horn Hill?" Jon asked.

His passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as he was. But he grew ill at the sight of blood, and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered. A dozen masters-at-arms came and went at Horn Hill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted. The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and starved. One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial. Another dressed him in his mother’s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor. He only grew fatter and more frightened, until Lord Randyll’s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing. "One time," Sam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, "two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it didn’t make me brave as they’d promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them scourged."

</p></origin><translate id="div_2379" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他怎么会来这儿？”山姆问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2380');"><p>"Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter. The girl was two years older, and Dareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father’s eye she named it rape, so here he is. When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder." Jon smiled. "Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing. Drinking songs he learned in his father’s winesink. Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart." They laughed at that together.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2380" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“金树城的罗宛伯爵发现女儿被他睡了。那个女的大他两岁，戴利恩发誓是她帮他爬进卧室窗户的，可在父亲严厉的目光下，她指称自己是被强暴，于是他就来啦。伊蒙师傅听过他唱歌后，说他的声音像加了蜜的雷。”琼恩微笑，“陶德有时也唱歌，如果你把那也算做是歌的话。他都唱些打他爹那儿学来的饮酒歌，派普说他的声音是加了尿的屁。”两人齐声哈哈大笑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2381');"><p>"I should like to hear them both," Sam admitted, "but they would not want me there." His face was troubled. "He’s going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn’t he?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2381" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们两人的歌声我都想听听，”山姆承认。“但他们不会欢迎我的。”他满脸愁容道，“他明天还会逼我打架，对吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2382');"><p>"He is," Jon was forced to say.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2382" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没错。”琼恩很不情愿地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2383');"><p>Sam got awkwardly to his feet. "I had better try to sleep." He huddled down in his cloak and plodded off.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2383" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆蹒跚地站起身。“我想办法睡一会儿好了。”他裹紧斗篷离开。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2384');"><p>The others were still in the common room when Jon returned, alone but for Ghost. "Where have you been?" Pyp asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2384" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩带着白灵回到大厅时，其他人都还在。“你跑哪儿去啦？”派普问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2385');"><p>"Talking with Sam," he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2385" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“跟山姆聊天。”他说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2386');"><p>"He truly is craven," said Grenn. "At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got his pie, but he was too scared to come sit with us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2386" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他实在窝囊透顶，”葛兰道，“晚上吃饭，长凳上明明还有空位，可他拿了馅饼偏偏就不敢过来跟我们一起坐。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2387');"><p>"The Lord of Ham thinks he’s too good to eat with the likes of us," suggested Jeren.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2387" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“火腿大人太尊贵啦，不跟我们这种人同桌用饭的。”杰伦猜测。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2388');"><p>"I saw him eat a pork pie," Toad said, smirking. "Do you think it was a brother?" He began to make oinking noises.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2388" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们看看他吃猪肉饼的样子，”陶德狞笑道，“简直就是在跟兄弟叙旧。”说完他学起了猪叫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2389');"><p>"Stop it!" Jon snapped angrily.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2389" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“闭嘴！”琼恩愤怒地斥道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2390');"><p>The other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury. "Listen to me," Jon said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be. Pyp backed him, as he’d known he would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise. Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon knew the words to move him. One by one the rest fell in line. Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were required. At the end they had all agreed?.?.?.?all but Rast.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2390" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其他男孩被他突如其来的怒气吓住，纷纷沉默下来。“听我说。”琼恩平静地告诉他们该怎么做。如他所料，派普站在他这边，但令人惊喜的是霍德也表示支持。葛兰起初还有些犹豫，但琼恩知道怎样才能说动他。其他人也纷纷同意。琼恩或好言劝说，或以利相诱，有时出言羞辱，必要的话也用武力要挟。最后所有人都愿意照他的话去做……只有雷斯特不肯。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2391');"><p>"You girls do as you please," Rast said, "but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I’m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon." He laughed in Jon’s face and left them there.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2391" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们要孬种就孬种罢，”雷斯特说，“但如果索恩叫我跟猪小姐打，我可是会好好切他一大块火腿下来。”他当着琼恩的面冷笑两声，转身便走。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2392');"><p>Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell. Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs. Jon could hear Rast’s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest. The direwolf’s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy’s throat, just enough to draw blood. "Remember, we know where you sleep," Jon said softly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2392" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>几小时后，当全城的人都在沉睡时，他们三个到他寝室去了一趟。当葛兰抓住他的手，派普坐上他的腿，白灵扑到他胸膛的时候，琼恩可以听见雷斯特急促的喘息。冰原狼的两眼如一对彤红的火烬，他用牙齿轻轻划破男孩喉咙柔软的皮肤，微微见血。“别忘了，我们知道你睡在哪儿。”琼恩轻声说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2393');"><p>The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2393" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>隔天早上，琼恩听见雷斯特对阿贝特和陶德解释，说他刮胡子的时候如何不小心被剃刀刮伤。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2394');"><p>From that day forth, neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly. When Ser Alliser matched them against him, they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow, clumsy strokes. If the master-at-arms screamed for an attack, they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg. Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse, yet Sam remained unhurt. A few nights later, at Jon’s urging, he joined them for the evening meal, taking a place on the bench beside Halder. It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in time he was laughing at Pyp’s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2394" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从那天起，不论是雷斯特或其他人，谁都不会伤害山姆威尔•塔利。若艾里沙爵士要他们和他单打，他们就站在原地，拨开他缓慢笨拙的攻击。假如教头扯着喉咙叫他们进攻，他们便跳到山姆身边，然后轻轻地在他胸甲、头盔或脚上点一记。艾里沙爵士气得半死，出言胁迫，骂他们是懦夫、娘娘腔，什么难听的话都出了笼，但依旧没人动山姆半根汗毛。几天后的一个晚上，他在琼恩的敦促下，坐在霍德旁边跟大家一起吃晚餐。之后又过了两个星期，他才鼓起勇气加入谈话，很快就跟其他人一样，被派普的鬼脸逗得哈哈大笑，然后开起葛兰的玩笑来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2395');"><p>Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. One night he visited Jon in his cell. "I don’t know what you did," he said, "but I know you did it." He looked away shyly. "I’ve never had a friend before."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2395" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆威尔•塔利虽然臃肿笨拙，胆子又小，但他可不笨。有天夜里，他来到琼恩的寝室，“我不知道你做了什么，”他说：“但我知道是你做的。”他害羞地转开视线。“我本来一个朋友也没有。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2396');"><p>"We’re not friends," Jon said. He put a hand on Sam’s broad shoulder. "We’re brothers."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2396" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们不是朋友，”琼恩拍拍山姆宽阔的肩膀，“我们是兄弟。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2397');"><p>And so they were, he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave. Robb and Bran and Rickon were his father’s sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them. Catelyn Stark had seen to that. The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night’s Watch.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2397" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们的确是兄弟啊，山姆离开后，他暗自思量。罗柏、布兰和瑞肯都是父亲的孩子，他也依然爱着他们，但由于凯特琳•史塔克的关系，琼恩知道自己终究不是他们的一分子。临冬城的灰墙或许仍令他魂牵梦萦，然而现在黑城堡才是他的生命皈依，他的手足兄弟则是山姆、葛兰、霍德、派普和其他无法见容于舓会。穿着黑衣的守夜人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2398');"><p>"My uncle spoke truly," he whispered to Ghost. He wondered if he would ever see Benjen Stark again, to tell him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2398" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“叔叔说得没错呢。”他悄声对白灵说，却不知此生能否与班扬•史塔克重逢，好当面感谢他。
