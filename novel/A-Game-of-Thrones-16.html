</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1230');"><p>Eddard Stark had left before dawn, Septa Mordane informed Sansa as they broke their fast. "The king sent for him. Another hunt, I do believe. There are still wild aurochs in these lands, I am told."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1230" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>早餐的时候，茉丹修女告诉珊莎，艾德•史塔克大人天亮前就离了营。“国王找他去的，我想肯定又是去外面打猎。听说这附近还有野牛出没哪。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1231');"><p>"I’ve never seen an aurochs," Sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table. The direwolf took it from her hand, as delicate as a queen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1231" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我从没见过野牛。”珊莎喂了块培根给餐桌底下的淑女，冰原狼像王后般优雅地从她手上衔过去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1232');"><p>Septa Mordane sniffed in disapproval. "A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table," she said, breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1232" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>茉丹修女不以为然地哼了一声。“好人家的小姐不在用餐时喂狗的。”她掰开一块蜂窝，让蜜滴到面包上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1233');"><p>"She’s not a dog, she’s a direwolf," Sansa pointed out as Lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue. "Anyway, Father said we could keep them with us if we want."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1233" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她才不是狗呢，她是冰原狼。”珊莎纠正。淑女伸出粗糙的舌头舔了舔她的手指。“反正父亲大人说小狼可以陪我们作伴。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1234');"><p>The septa was not appeased. "You’re a good girl, Sansa, but I do vow, when it comes to that creature you’re as willful as your sister Arya." She scowled. "And where is Arya this morning?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1234" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>修女看来很不服气。“珊莎，你是个好女孩，但只要一说到那只野东西，你就倔得跟你妹妹艾莉亚一个样。”她皱起眉头，“说到艾莉亚，她这会儿又跑哪儿去了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1235');"><p>"She wasn’t hungry," Sansa said, knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cook’s boy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1235" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她肚子不饿。”珊莎道。她心里很清楚，艾莉亚八成早就溜进厨房，好说歹说地跟哪个厨房小弟讨到一顿丰盛早餐了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1236');"><p>"Do remind her to dress nicely today. The grey velvet, perhaps. We are all invited to ride with the queen and Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse, and we must look our best."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1236" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“得提醒她今天穿得体面些。那件灰色的天鹅绒衣服不错。王后和弥赛菈公主邀请我们过去一同搭乘轮宫，我们可要表现出最好的一面才行。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1237');"><p>Sansa already looked her best. She had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone, and picked her nicest blue silks. She had been looking forward to today for more than a week. It was a great honor to ride with the queen, and besides, Prince Joffrey might be there. Her betrothed. Just thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside, even though they were not to marry for years and years. Sansa did not really know Joffrey yet, but she was already in love with him. He was all she ever dreamt her prince should be, tall and handsome and strong, with hair like gold. She treasured every chance to spend time with him, few as they were. The only thing that scared her about today was Arya. Arya had a way of ruining everything. You never knew what she would do. "I’ll tell her," Sansa said uncertainly, "but she’ll dress the way she always does." She hoped it wouldn’t be too embarrassing. "May I be excused?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1237" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎的表现已经好得不能再好。她把栗色长发梳得发亮，然后穿上她最好的蓝丝绒礼服。最近这一个多星期，她天天都在盼望今天的到来。能与王后作伴是至高无尚的荣耀，更何况乔佛里可能也在。那可是她的未婚夫呢。虽然他们还要等许多年才会成婚，但每当想到他，她心里总会产生一阵奇怪的悸动。算起来珊莎还根本不了解乔佛里，可她却已经爱上他了。他具有她心目中白马王子的每一项优点，高大英挺，体格强壮，一头漂亮金发。她珍视与他共处的每一个机会，可惜这样的时刻屈指可数。今天她惟一担心的便是艾莉亚。艾莉亚有种把每件事都搞砸的本领，你永远不知道她接下去会闯出什么祸来。“我去跟她讲，”她不太确定地说，“但她爱怎么穿是她的事。”她只能祈祷别太离谱了。“我可以先告退了吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1238');"><p>"You may." Septa Mordane helped herself to more bread and honey, and Sansa slid from the bench. Lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inn’s common room.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1238" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你去罢。”茉丹修女又拿了一堆面包和蜂蜜，珊莎滑下长凳，跑出旅店大厅，淑女紧跟在后。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1239');"><p>Outside, she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the men broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another day’s march. The inn was a sprawling three-story structure of pale stone, the biggest that Sansa had ever seen, but even so, it had accommodations for less than a third of the king’s party, which had swollen to more than four hundred with the addition of her father’s household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1239" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>门外，人们正忙着拆除大小营帐，把东西装上马车，准备新一天的行程。她在叫骂声和木头车轮的嘎吱声中站立了片刻。这是栋占地广阔，白石砌成的三层建筑，珊莎还没见过比这更大的旅馆。即便如此，却只能容纳国王手下不到三分之一的人手。加上她父亲的随从和沿途加入的自由骑手，国王的队伍已经超过了四百人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1240');"><p>She found Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while she brushed dried mud from her fur. The direwolf was not enjoying the process. Arya was wearing the same riding leathers she had worn yesterday and the day before.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1240" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她在三叉戟河畔找到了妹妹。艾莉亚正死命按住娜梅莉亚，想把她身上干涸结块的泥巴刷掉，但显然小狼并不领情。艾莉亚身上穿的正是昨天那套皮革马装，她前天穿的也是这套。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1241');"><p>"You better put on something pretty," Sansa told her. "Septa Mordane said so. We’re traveling in the queen’s wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1241" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我看你还是快换件像样的衣服吧，”珊莎对她说。“这可是茉丹修女说的。今天我们要和弥赛菈公主一起搭乘王后的轮宫呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1242');"><p>"I’m not," Arya said, trying to brush a tangle out of Nymeria’s matted grey fur. "Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1242" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不去。”艾莉亚一边说，一边试着把娜梅莉亚身上一撮打结的毛梳整齐。“我跟米凯要骑马到河上游的浅滩去找红宝石。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1243');"><p>"Rubies," Sansa said, lost. "What rubies?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1243" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“红宝石，”珊莎不明白，“什么红宝石？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1244');"><p>Arya gave her a look like she was so stupid. "Rhaegar’s rubies. This is where King Robert killed him and won the crown."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1244" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚白了她一眼，仿佛把她当成蠢蛋。“当然是雷加的红宝石啊。当年劳勃国王就是在那儿杀死他夺得王位的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1245');"><p>Sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief. "You can’t look for rubies, the princess is expecting us. The queen invited us both."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1245" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎难以置信地望着自己骨瘦如柴的小妹。“不准你去找什么红宝石，公主正等着我们呢，王后邀请的是我们两人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1246');"><p>"I don’t care," Arya said. "The wheelhouse doesn’t even have windows, you can’t see a thing."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1246" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我才不管。”艾莉亚说，“轮宫里连扇窗户都没有，什么也看不见。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1247');"><p>"What could you want to see?" Sansa said, annoyed. She had been thrilled by the invitation, and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything, just as she’d feared. "It’s all just fields and farms and holdfasts."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1247" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“外面有什么好看？”珊莎不悦地说。对于这次邀请她可是满心期待，但她蠢笨的妹妹却要搞砸一切，正如她所害怕的。“不过是些田地、农场和村落罢了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1248');"><p>"It is not," Arya said stubbornly. "If you came with us sometimes, you’d see."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1248" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“才不是呢。”艾莉亚固执地说，“哪天你跟我们一起去看看就知道了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1249');"><p>"I hate riding," Sansa said fervently. "All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1249" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我最讨厌骑马了，”珊莎激动地说，“只会溅得一身泥沙，浑身酸麻。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1250');"><p>Arya shrugged. "Hold still," she snapped at Nymeria, "I’m not hurting you." Then to Sansa she said, "When we were crossing the Neck, I counted thirty-six flowers I never saw before, and Mycah showed me a lizard-lion."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1250" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚耸耸肩。“别动，”她斥责娜梅莉亚。“我不会伤害你的。”然后她转向珊莎说，“不是啦，穿越颈泽的时候，我一共发现了三十六种以前没见过的花，米凯还给我看了一只蜥狮呢。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1251');"><p>Sansa shuddered. They had been twelve days crossing the Neck, rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog, and she had hated every moment of it. The air had been damp and clammy, the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night, they had to stop right on the kingsroad. Dense thickets of half-drowned trees pressed close around them, branches dripping with curtains of pale fungus. Huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water, but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were quicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and lizard lions floating half-submerged in the water, like black logs with eyes and teeth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1251" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎听了浑身颤抖。他们沿着蜿蜒的堤道，缓慢地通过看似永无止尽的黑色泥泞，一共花了十二天的时间方才穿越颈泽。对于这趟旅程，她可是从头痛恨到尾。那里的空气阴湿黏腻，加上堤道太狭窄，夜里连扎营都没办法，只好停留在国王大道上。长年浸泡在腐沼之中的浓密树丛，从道路两旁朝他们步步进逼，枝干间垂下帘幕般的菌类植物。巨大的花朵盛开在烂泥坑里，漂浮在死水潭上。可假如你愚蠢到想离开堤道去采摘，四处随时有流沙等着将你吞噬。密林里有虎视眈眈的毒蛇，水中有半浮半沉的蜥狮，看起来活像长了眼睛和牙齿的黑木头。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1252');"><p>None of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her horsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept hoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers. That just made her worse.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1252" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>想也知道，这些全难不倒艾莉亚。有次她居然满脸堆着马一样的笑容，头发乱成一团，衣服全是泥泞，拎了一束烂兮兮的紫绿花朵回来送给爸爸。珊莎一直希望哪天父亲大人会叫艾莉亚注意礼节，有点她应有的淑女模样，可他从没这么做过，这一次，他反而拥抱她并感谢那些花。简直就是火上浇油。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1253');"><p>Then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on her arms. Sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it, and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the itching. She had bruises on her arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded green-and-yellow splotches, Sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep. How she had gotten those only the seven gods knew.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1253" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>事后大家才知道，那些紫花叫做“毒吻花”，而艾莉亚的双臂果然都起了红疹子。珊莎本以为这次的教训够她受了，没想到艾莉亚却只是笑笑，隔天一听她那朋友米凯说涂上烂泥可以减轻疼痛，便立刻照办，把自己弄得活像个未开化的沼泽女人。这还不止，晚上妹妹脱衣服睡觉时，珊莎注意到她的手臂和肩膀上有不少擦伤，深紫的瘀青和褪色的黄绿色脏东西。这些究竟是她打哪儿弄来的，恐怕就只有天上的七神知道了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1254');"><p>Arya was still going on, brushing out Nymeria’s tangles and chattering about things she’d seen on the trek south. "Last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses. You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of Nymeria." The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya scolded her. "Stop that, I have to do the other side, you’re all muddy."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1254" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>瞧她现在吧，艾莉亚仍旧没完没了，一边梳理娜梅莉亚的毛团，一边絮絮叨叨这次南下的所见所闻。“上星期我们找到一座很阴森的了望塔，昨天我们才追赶了一大群野马。你真该来看看他们一闻到娜梅莉亚拔腿就跑的模样。”小狼在她的魔掌下扭个不停，艾莉亚又叱道：“别闹，还有一边要弄呢，瞧你全身都是泥巴。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1255');"><p>"You’re not supposed to leave the column," Sansa reminded her. "Father said so."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1255" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你不该擅自脱队，”珊莎提醒她，“父亲大人说过的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1256');"><p>Arya shrugged. "I didn’t go far. Anyway, Nymeria was with me the whole time. I don’t always go off, either. Sometimes it’s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1256" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚一耸肩：“我又没跑远。反正有娜梅莉亚陪在身边。况且我也不是每次都脱队，有时候跟着货车一起走，到处串串门子也挺有意思。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1257');"><p>Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with anybody. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher’s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block. Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but Arya seemed to prefer his company to hers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1257" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚专门结交哪些人，珊莎太清楚了：侍从、马夫与女仆，老头子和不穿衣服的小孩，还有满嘴粗话，出身低贱的自由骑手。艾莉亚跟任何人都能做朋友，而这米凯是最糟糕的一个：他是个屠夫的学徒，十三岁，野得很，躺在运肉的货车上，闻起来活像只待宰的猪。光瞧见他就足以令珊莎作呕，谁知艾莉亚却宁可与他为伍。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1258');"><p>Sansa was running out of patience now. "You have to come with me," she told her sister firmly. "You can’t refuse the queen. Septa Mordane will expect you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1258" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎觉得自己快要失去耐性。“你一定要跟我去，”她语气坚定地告诉妹妹，“你不能拒绝王后的邀请，茉丹修女正等着你呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1259');"><p>Arya ignored her. She gave a hard yank with the brush. Nymeria growled and spun away, affronted. "Come back here!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1259" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚充耳不闻，她突然猛力一刷，娜梅莉亚吃痛，低吼一声，扭头便跑。“你给我回来！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1260');"><p>"There’s going to be lemon cakes and tea," Sansa went on, all adult and reasonable. Lady brushed against her leg. Sansa scratched her ears the way she liked, and Lady sat beside her on her haunches, watching Arya chase Nymeria. "Why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1260" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“等下有柠檬蛋糕和茶可吃喔，”珊莎继续说，摆出一副大人说理的口吻。淑女蹭了蹭她的脚，珊莎用她喜欢的方式帮她搔搔耳朵，淑女便后脚蹲地，在她身边坐了下来，看着艾莉亚追赶娜梅莉亚。“当你可以舒舒服服靠着羽毛枕头，和王后一起享受蛋糕时，怎么会想骑着臭马，弄得四肢酸痛，满身大汗呢？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1261');"><p>"I don’t like the queen," Arya said casually. Sansa sucked in her breath, shocked that even Arya would say such a thing, but her sister prattled on, heedless. "She won’t even let me bring Nymeria." She thrust the brush under her belt and stalked her wolf. Nymeria watched her approach warily.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1261" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不喜欢王后。”艾莉亚随口道。珊莎听了倒抽一口冷气，即便是由艾莉亚口中说出来，她仍旧十分震惊。但艾莉亚却满不在乎地继续下去，“她连让我带娜梅莉亚都不准。”她把梳子往腰带里一插，偷偷地朝她的小狼走去。娜梅莉亚小心翼翼地看着她逼近。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1262');"><p>"A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf," Sansa said. "And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them, you know that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1262" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“御用轮宫本来就不是让狼撒野的地方。”珊莎说，“而且你也知道弥赛菈公主很怕它们。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1263');"><p>"Myrcella is a little baby." Arya grabbed Nymeria around her neck, but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off. Frustrated, Arya threw down the brush. "Bad wolf!" she shouted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1263" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“弥赛是个小娃娃。”艾莉亚一把攫住娜梅莉亚的脖子，可她才拔出梳子，冰原狼便使劲一扭逃开了。艾莉亚气得丢下梳子。“你这个大坏蛋！”她吼道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1264');"><p>Sansa couldn’t help but smile a little. The kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master. She gave Lady a quick little hug. Lady licked her cheek. Sansa giggled. Arya heard and whirled around, glaring. "I don’t care what you say, I’m going out riding." Her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant she was going to do something willful.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1264" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎不禁微笑。以前临冬城里的驯兽长法兰曾对她说过，有什么样的主人就会养出什么样的动物。她轻轻抱了淑女一下，淑女舔舔她的脸颊，珊莎咯咯直笑。艾莉亚听见笑声，转身怒视道：“我不管你怎么说，我就是要去骑马。”她那张又长又顽固的马脸露出一种即将任性而为的表情。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1265');"><p>"Gods be true, Arya, sometimes you act like such a child," Sansa said. "I’ll go by myself then. It will be ever so much nicer that way. Lady and I will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1265" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“老天爷，艾莉亚，有时候你才真像个小孩子。”珊莎道，“那我就自己去啰。你不去更好，这样我和淑女就可以把所有的柠檬蛋糕吃完，好好享受美好时光。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1266');"><p>She turned to walk off, but Arya shouted after her, "They won’t let you bring Lady either." She was gone before Sansa could think of a reply, chasing Nymeria along the river.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1266" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她转身要走，艾莉亚却在她身后叫道：“他们也不会让你带上淑女的。”珊莎还没想好如何回嘴，她便沿着河岸追赶娜梅莉亚，跑得不见人影了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1267');"><p>Alone and humiliated, Sansa took the long way back to the inn, where she knew Septa Mordane would be waiting. Lady padded quietly by her side. She was almost in tears. All she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty, the way they were in the songs. Why couldn’t Arya be sweet and delicate and kind, like Princess Myrcella? She would have liked a sister like that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1267" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎觉得既孤单又羞愤，只好独自返回下榻的旅店，她知道茉丹修女一定在等她。淑女静静地走在她身边，走着走着，她的眼泪便掉了下来。她只不过希望一切都像歌谣里描绘的那样顺利美好，为何艾莉亚偏偏不能当个甜美优雅又善良的好女孩，像弥赛菈公主那样呢？有个那样的妹妹该有多好埃
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1268');"><p>Sansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart, could be so different. It would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like their half brother Jon. She even looked like Jon, with the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring. And Jon’s mother had been common, or so people whispered. Once, when she was littler, Sansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn’t been some mistake. Perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister. But Mother had only laughed and said no, Arya was her daughter and Sansa’s trueborn sister, blood of their blood. Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about it, so she supposed it had to be true.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1268" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎怎么也想不透，年龄仅仅相差两岁的姐妹，个性怎么会差那么多。艾莉亚要是个私生女就好了，就像她们的私生子哥哥琼恩。说老实话，艾莉亚连长相都跟琼恩非常神似，两人都有史塔克家的长脸和棕发，却完全没有他们母亲的容貌、肤色与头发。听别人闲话，琼恩的妈妈不过是一介平民而已。珊莎小时候，有一次忍不住问母亲是否弄错了，会不会是什么古灵精怪把她真正的妹妹给抱走了？但母亲只笑笑，然后说没这回事，艾莉亚的确是她女儿，也是珊莎的亲妹妹。珊莎想不出母亲有什么理由要骗她，便把她的话当真了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1269');"><p>As she neared the center of camp, her distress was quickly forgotten. A crowd had gathered around the queen’s wheelhouse. Sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees. The doors had been thrown open, she saw, and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps, smiling down at someone. She heard her saying, "The council does us great honor, my good lords."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1269" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>好在走近营地，方才的种种不快都被她抛在脑后。王后的行宫外正聚集了一群人，珊莎听见他们兴奋地交谈，像是一大群蜜蜂嗡嗡作响。行宫的大门敞开，王后站在木头阶梯的最上层，对着人群里的某人微笑。珊莎听见她说：“两位大人，重臣们真是太周到了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1270');"><p>"What’s happening?" she asked a squire she knew.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1270" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“发生了什么事？”她问一个认识的侍从。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1271');"><p>"The council sent riders from King’s Landing to escort us the rest of the way," he told her. "An honor guard for the king."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1273');"><p>One knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales, brilliant as a field of new-fallen snow, with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun. When he removed his helm, Sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor, yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that. From his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the Kingsguard.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1274');"><p>His companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green. He was the handsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon; tall and powerfully made, with jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face, and laughing green eyes to match his armor. Cradled under one arm was an antlered helm, its magnificent rack shimmering in gold.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1274" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的同伴年约二十，一身精钢打造的深绿铠甲，绿如密林。他是珊莎所见过的最英俊的男子，体格高大魁梧，黑玉般的及肩长发衬托出他修整干净的脸庞，那双带着笑意的蓝眼，正好与盔甲的颜色交相辉映。他怀抱一顶鹿角盔，两只华丽的鹿角金光闪闪。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1275');"><p>At first Sansa did not notice the third stranger. He did not kneel with the others. He stood to one side, beside their horses, a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence. His face was pockmarked and beardless, with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks. Though he was not an old man, only a few wisps of hair remained to him, sprouting above his ears, but those he had grown long as a woman’s. His armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather, plain and unadorned, and it spoke of age and hard use. Above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible; a two-handed greatsword, too long to be worn at his side.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1275" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎起初没注意到第三个陌生人。他形容憔悴，神情冷酷，并未像其他人一样屈膝下跪，而是独自站在他们的坐骑旁，默默地观望。此人满脸麻子，没有胡须，两眼深邃，面颊凹陷。虽然并不老，头发却没剩几根，只在双耳上面冒出几撮，不过他把这些仅存的头发留得跟女人家一样长。他硬皮衣外罩上铁灰色的锁子甲，虽式样平凡，毫无装饰，却历尽沧桑，看得出岁月的痕迹。在他右肩之后，可以见到一把脏污的皮革剑柄，大抵是他的双手巨剑太长，没法佩在腰间。

She stepped backward and bumped into someone.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1277');"><p>Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders, and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father, but when she turned, it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her, his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile. "You are shaking, girl," he said, his voice rasping. "Do I frighten you so much?"

Still, Sansa wrenched away from him, and the Hound laughed, and Lady moved between them, rumbling a warning. Sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf. They were all gathered around gaping, she could feel their eyes on her, and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter.

Tears filled her eyes.

No one will hurt you. Put away your swords, all of you. The wolf is her little pet, that’s all." He looked at Sandor Clegane. "And you, dog, away with you, you’re scaring my betrothed."

They explored the caves by the riverbank, and tracked a shadowcat to its lair, and when they grew hungry, Joffrey found a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady. They dined on trout fresh from the river, and Sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before. "My father only lets us have one cup, and only at feasts," she confessed to her prince.

</p></origin><translate id="div_1318" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有我在不用怕。”乔佛里从剑鞘里拔出‘狮牙’，金属和皮革的摩擦却让她浑身颤抖。“走这边。”说着他策马穿过一排树林。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1319');"><p>Beyond, in a clearing overlooking the river, they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights. Their swords were wooden sticks, broom handles from the look of them, and they were rushing across the grass, swinging at each other lustily. The boy was years older, a head taller, and much stronger, and he was pressing the attack. The girl, a scrawny thing in soiled leathers, was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boy’s blows, but not all. When she tried to lunge at him, he caught her stick with his own, swept it aside, and slid his wood down hard on her fingers. She cried out and lost her weapon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1319" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>树林那端有片空地，地势恰好俯瞡河流。他们在这里找到一对正玩着骑士游戏的男孩女孩，两人正以木棍（其实是扫帚杆）为剑，在草地上横冲直撞，精力充沛地相互砍杀。男孩的年龄要大几岁，个子则足足高出一头，体格也强壮许多，处于发动攻势的一方。女孩一身干瘦，穿着脏兮兮的皮衣，正手忙脚乱地抵挡男孩的攻击，却无法完全避开。当她试图反击时，被对方用剑挡住，并将她的剑往旁一扫，顺势用力劈她手指。她痛得立刻丢下武器大叫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1320');"><p>Prince Joffrey laughed. The boy looked around, wide-eyed and startled, and dropped his stick in the grass. The girl glared at them, sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out, and Sansa was horrified. "Arya?" she called out incredulously.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1320" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔佛里王子哈哈大笑。男孩睁大眼睛吃惊地转过头来，随即一松手，木棍落地。女孩瞪着他们，一边吮着指关节想把刺吸出来，珊莎吓坏了。“艾莉亚，是你吗？”她难以置信地惊呼道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1321');"><p>"Go away," Arya shouted back at them, angry tears in her eyes. "What are you doing here? Leave us alone."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1321" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“走开。”艾莉亚眼里满是愤怒的泪水，大声地朝他们嚷嚷，“你们来这里做什么？不要管我们的事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1322');"><p>Joffrey glanced from Arya to Sansa and back again. "Your sister?" She nodded, blushing. Joffrey examined the boy, an ungainly lad with a coarse, freckled face and thick red hair. "And who are you, boy?" he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1322" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔佛里看看艾莉亚，又看看珊莎，目光扫了几辫。“这是你妹妹？”珊莎红着脸点头。乔佛里转而仔细审视那名男孩，他是个满脸雀斑，一头浓密红发的丑陋少年。“小子，你又是谁？”他以命令的口吻问，丝毫没在意对方年纪还大他一岁。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1323');"><p>"Mycah," the boy muttered. He recognized the prince and averted his eyes. "M’lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1323" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我叫米凯，”男孩低声说，他认出眼前的王子，连忙移开视线。“王子殿下。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1324');"><p>"He’s the butcher’s boy," Sansa said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1324" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他是屠夫的学徒。”珊莎解释说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1325');"><p>"He’s my friend," Arya said sharply. "You leave him alone."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1325" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他是我朋友，”艾莉亚语气尖锐地道，“你们别欺负他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1326');"><p>"A butcher’s boy who wants to be a knight, is it?" Joffrey swung down from his mount, sword in hand. "Pick up your sword, butcher’s boy," he said, his eyes bright with amusement. "Let us see how good you are."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1326" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“杀猪小弟也想当骑士，是吗？”乔佛里翻身下马，手中握剑。“屠夫小弟，把你的剑捡起来。”他眼里闪着愉悦的光芒，“咱们来瞧瞧你够不够格。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1327');"><p>Mycah stood there, frozen with fear.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1327" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>米凯吓得伫立原地。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1328');"><p>Joffrey walked toward him. "Go on, pick it up. Or do you only fight little girls?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1328" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔佛里朝他走去。“快啊，快捡，难道你只敢欺负小女生？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1329');"><p>"She ast me to, m’lord," Mycah said. "She ast me to."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1329" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，是她逼我的，”米凯说，“是她逼我这么做的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1330');"><p>Sansa had only to glance at Arya and see the flush on her sister’s face to know the boy was telling the truth, but Joffrey was in no mood to listen. The wine had made him wild. "Are you going to pick up your sword?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1330" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎只需瞄艾莉亚一眼，看见妹妹倏地红了脸，便知男孩所言不假。但乔佛里听不进去，刚喝的那些酒让他性子野了起来。“你到底捡还是不捡？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1331');"><p>Mycah shook his head. "It’s only a stick, m’lord. It’s not no sword, it’s only a stick."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1331" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>米凯摇头：“大人，这不过是根木棒，不是剑，只是根棍子罢了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1332');"><p>"And you’re only a butcher’s boy, and no knight." Joffrey lifted Lion’s Tooth and laid its point on Mycah’s cheek below the eye, as the butcher’s boy stood trembling. "That was my lady’s sister you were hitting, do you know that?" A bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into Mycah’s flesh, and a slow red line trickled down the boy’s cheek.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1332" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你也不过是个杀猪小弟，根本不是骑士。”乔佛里举起“狮牙”，剑尖指着米凯眼睛下方的脸颊，屠夫学徒站在原地颤抖。“刚才你打的是我这位小姐的妹妹，你知不知道？”一朵殷红的血花在剑刺入的地方绽放，男孩的脸上缓缓流下一道红线。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1333');"><p>"Stop it!" Arya screamed. She grabbed up her fallen stick.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1333" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“住手！”艾莉亚尖叫，随即一把抓起刚才掉落的木棍。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1334');"><p>Sansa was afraid. "Arya, you stay out of this."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1334" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎好害怕。“艾莉亚，你别插手。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1335');"><p>"I won’t hurt him?.?.?.?much," Prince Joffrey told Arya, never taking his eyes off the butcher’s boy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1335" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不会把他……伤得太厉害。”乔佛里王子告诉艾莉亚，他的视线自始至终没离开屠夫的小徒弟。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1336');"><p>Arya went for him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1336" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚朝他扑去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1337');"><p>Sansa slid off her mare, but she was too slow. Arya swung with both hands. There was a loud crack as the wood split against the back of the prince’s head, and then everything happened at once before Sansa’s horrified eyes. Joffrey staggered and whirled around, roaring curses. Mycah ran for the trees as fast as his legs would take him. Arya swung at the prince again, but this time Joffrey caught the blow on Lion’s Tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands. The back of his head was all bloody and his eyes were on fire. Sansa was shrieking, "No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you, you’re spoiling it," but no one was listening. Arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at Joffrey’s head. She hit his horse instead, and the blood bay reared and went galloping off after Mycah. "Stop it, don’t, stop it!" Sansa screamed. Joffrey slashed at Arya with his sword, screaming obscenities, terrible words, filthy words. Arya darted back, frightened now, but Joffrey followed, hounding her toward the woods, backing her up against a tree. Sansa didn’t know what to do. She watched helplessly, almost blind from her tears.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1337" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎见状急忙跳下马，但已经太迟了。艾莉亚双手握住木棒，朝王子后脑狠狠一敲，只听喀啦一声，棍子应声开裂。乔佛里则踉跄旋身，大声骂着粗话。米凯拔腿便往林子里逃。艾莉亚挥棒再打，但这回乔佛里举起 “狮牙”，把她手中的扫帚棍打断、震飞。他后脑勺全是血，眼里燃烧着怒火，珊莎拚命尖叫：“住手，你们两个都住手，你们把事情都搞砸了。”但没人听她的话。艾莉亚捡起石块朝乔佛里的头掷去，却打中了他的马。血红色的骏马扬起前腿，跟在米凯后面狂奔。“住手！不要打了！”珊莎尖叫。乔佛里挥剑朝艾莉亚猛砍，嘴里不停喝骂着可怕的脏话。这时艾莉亚也害怕得急步后退，但乔佛里节节进逼，把她逼到没有退路的林边。珊莎不知如何是好，只能无助地在旁观望，视线几乎被泪水所掩盖。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1338');"><p>Then a grey blur flashed past her, and suddenly Nymeria was there, leaping, jaws closing around Joffrey’s sword arm. The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet, and they rolled in the grass, the wolf snarling and ripping at him, the prince shrieking in pain. "Get it off," he screamed. "Get it off!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1338" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说时迟，那时快，一团灰影从她身边闪过，下一刻娜梅莉亚已跃上乔佛里右手，张口便咬。狼把人扑倒在地，他手一松剑便掉落，人和狼双双在草地上打滚，狼不停咆哮撕扯，王子则惨叫连连。“把它弄走！”他尖叫道，“快把它弄走！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1339');"><p>Arya’s voice cracked like a whip. "Nymeria!"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1340');"><p>The direwolf let go of Joffrey and moved to Arya’s side. The prince lay in the grass, whimpering, cradling his mangled arm. His shirt was soaked in blood. Arya said, "She didn’t hurt you?.?.?.?much." She picked up Lion’s Tooth where it had fallen, and stood over him, holding the sword with both hands.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1340" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>冰原狼立时放开乔佛里，跑到艾莉亚身边。王子躺在草丛里，抱着受伤的手臂啜泣。他的衣服上全是血。艾莉亚说：“她也没把你……伤得太厉害嘛。”她捡起 “狮牙”，站在他跟前，双手握剑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1341');"><p>Jofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her. "No," he said, "don’t hurt me. I’ll tell my mother."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1343');"><p>Arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting her whole body into the throw. The blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river. It hit the water and vanished with a splash. Joffrey moaned. Arya ran off to her horse, Nymeria loping at her heels.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1343" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚猛地一旋身，用尽全身力气把剑抛了出去。宝剑飞过河面，蓝钢打造的剑身在阳光下闪闪发光，最后噗通一声掉进水里，刹时便沉了下去。乔佛里见状又是一声呻吟。艾莉亚跑向她的坐骑，娜梅莉亚跟在她后面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1344');"><p>After they had gone, Sansa went to Prince Joffrey. His eyes were closed in pain, his breath ragged. Sansa knelt beside him. "Joffrey," she sobbed. "Oh, look what they did, look what they did. My poor prince. Don’t be afraid. I’ll ride to the holdfast and bring help for you." Tenderly she reached out and brushed back his soft blond hair.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1344" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她们离开后，珊莎走到王子身旁。他痛苦地紧闭双眼，呼吸急促。珊莎在他身旁跪下。“乔佛里，”她抽噎道，“噢，看看她们做了什么好事，把你伤成这样。我可怜的王子，你别害怕，我这就骑马去刚才的庄园，找人来帮忙。”她伸手温柔地拨开他柔软的金发。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1345');"><p>His eyes snapped open and looked at her, and there was nothing but loathing there, nothing but the vilest contempt. "Then go," he spit at her. "And don’t touch me."
