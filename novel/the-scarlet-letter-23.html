</p></origin><translate id="div_665" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>#ch 第二十三章 红字的显露
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_666');"><p>The eloquent voice, on which the souls of the listening audience had been borne aloft as on the swelling waves of the sea, at length came to a pause.  There was a momentary silence, profound as what should follow the utterance of oracles.  Then ensued a murmur and half-hushed tumult, as if the auditors, released from the high spell that had transported them into the region of another's mind, were returning into themselves, with all their awe and wonder still heavy on them.  In a moment more the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the church.  Now that there was an end, they needed more breath, more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which they relapsed, than that atmosphere which the preacher had converted into words of flame, and had burdened with the rich fragrance of his thought. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_666" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>犹如汹涌的海港般载着听众的灵魂高高升起的雄辩的话音，终于告一段落。那一刹那的静穆，如同宣告了神谕之后一般深沉。随后便是一阵窃窃私语和压低嗓门的瞳哗；似乎听众们从把他们带到另中种心境去的高级咒语中解脱出来，如今依然怀着全部惊惧的重荷重新苏醒了。过了一会儿，人群便开始从教堂的大门蜂拥而出。如今布道已经结束，他们步出被牧师化作火一般语言的、满载着他思想的香馥的气氛，需要换上另一种空气，才更适合支持他们的世俗生活。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_667');"><p>In the open air their rapture broke into speech.  The street and the market-place absolutely babbled, from side to side, with applauses of the minister.  His hearers could not rest until they had told one another of what each knew better than he could tell or hear. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_667" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>来到户外，他们如醉如痴的狂喜进发成语言。街道上、市场中、到处都翻腾着对牧师的腆美之词。他的听众们滔滔不绝地彼此诉说着每个人所知道的一切，直到全都说尽听够为止。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_668');"><p>According to their united testimony, never had man spoken in so wise, so high, and so holy a spirit, as he that spake this day; nor had inspiration ever breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through his.  Its influence could be seen, as it were, descending upon him, and possessing him, and continually lifting him out of the written discourse that lay before him, and filling him with ideas that must have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience.  His subject, it appeared, had been the relation between the Deity and the communities of mankind, with a special reference to the New England which they were here planting in the wilderness.  And, as he drew towards the close, a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him, constraining him to its purpose as mightily as the old prophets of Israel were constrained, only with this difference, that, whereas the Jewish seers had denounced judgments and ruin on their country, it was his mission to foretell a high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people of the Lord.  But, throughout it all, and through the whole discourse, there had been a certain deep, sad undertone of pathos, which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural regret of one soon to pass away.  Yes; their minister whom they so loved--and who so loved them all, that he could not depart heavenward without a sigh--had the foreboding of untimely death upon him, and would soon leave them in their tears.  This idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the last emphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced; it was as if an angel, in his passage to the skies, had shaken his bright wings over the people for an instant--at once a shadow and a splendour--and had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_668" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们异口同声地断言，从来没有淮象他今天这样讲得如此睿智、如此祟高、如此神圣；也没有哪个凡人的口中能够象他这样吐出如此鲜明的启示。显而易见，那启示的力量降临到了他身上，左右着他，不断地把他从面前的讲稿上提高，并以一些对他本人和对听众都妙不可言的观念充实着他。他所讲的主题音乐是上帝与人类社会的关系，尤指他们在这里垦荒播种的新英格兰。当他的布道接近结尾的时候，似是预言的一种精神降临在他身上，如同当年支配着以色列的老预言家一样强有力地迫使他就范；唯一不同的是，犹太人预言家当年宣告的是他们国内的天罚和灭亡，而他的使命则是预示新近在这里集结起来的上帝的臣民们的崇高而光荣的命运。但是，贯穿布道词始终的，一直有某种低沉、哀伤的悲调，使人们只能将其解释为一个即将告别人世的人的自然的仟悔。是啊；他们如此爱戴、也如此热爱他们的牧师不能不叹息一声就离开他们飞向天国啊！他们的牧师已经预感到那不合时宜的死亡的降临，很快就要在他们的哭声中离他们而去了！想到牧师弥留世上的时间已经不长，他那番布道词所产生的效果就更增加了最终强调的力量；如同一个天使在飞往天国的途中在人们的头上扇动了一下明亮的翅膀，随着一片阴影和一束光彩，向他们洒下了一阵黄金般的真理。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_669');"><p>Thus, there had come to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale--as to most men, in their various spheres, though seldom recognised until they see it far behind them--an epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph than any previous one, or than any which could hereafter be.  He stood, at this moment, on the very proudest eminence of superiority, to which the gifts or intellect, rich lore, prevailing eloquence, and a reputation of whitest sanctity, could exalt a clergyman in New England's earliest days, when the professional character was of itself a lofty pedestal.  Such was the position which the minister occupied, as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit at the close of his Election Sermon.  Meanwhile Hester Prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory, with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast! 
</p></origin><translate id="div_669" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，丁梅斯代尔牧师先生来到了他一生中空前绝后的最辉煌也是最充满胜利的时期，许多人在他们不同的领域里也曾有过这样的时期；只是经过好久以后他们往往才意识到。此时，他是站在最骄傲的卓越地位之上，在早期的新英格兰，牧师这一职业本身已然是一座高高的础座，而一个牧师要想达到他如今那种高度，还有赖于智慧的天赋、丰富的学识、超凡的口才和最无理的圣洁的名声。当我们的这位牧师结束了他在庆祝选举日的布道，在讲坛的靠垫上向前垂着头时，所处的正是这样一个高位。与此同时，海丝特·白兰却站在刑台的旁边，胸前依然灼烧着红字！
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_670');"><p>Now was heard again the clamour of the music, and the measured tramp of the military escort issuing from the church door.  The procession was to be marshalled thence to the town hall, where a solemn banquet would complete the ceremonies of the day. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_670" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时又听到了铿锵的音乐和卫队的整齐的步伐声从教堂门口传出。游行队伍将从那里走到镇议事厅，以厅中的一个庄严的宴会来结束这一天的庆典。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_671');"><p>Once more, therefore, the train of venerable and majestic fathers were seen moving through a broad pathway of the people, who drew back reverently, on either side, as the Governor and magistrates, the old and wise men, the holy ministers, and all that were eminent and renowned, advanced into the midst of them. When they were fairly in the marketplace, their presence was greeted by a shout.  This--though doubtless it might acquire additional force and volume from the child-like loyalty which the age awarded to its rulers--was felt to be an irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their ears. Each felt the impulse in himself, and in the same breath, caught it from his neighbour.  Within the church, it had hardly been kept down; beneath the sky it pealed upward to the zenith.  There were human beings enough, and enough of highly wrought and symphonious feeling to produce that more impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast, or the thunder, or the roar of the sea; even that mighty swell of many voices, blended into one great voice by the universal impulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many.  Never, from the soil of New England had gone up such a shout!  Never, on New England soil had stood the man so honoured by his mortal brethren as the preacher! 
</p></origin><translate id="div_671" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，人们又一次看到，由令人肃然起敬的威风凛凛的人士组成的队伍走在宽宽的通道上，夹道观看的群众在总督和官员们、贤明的长者、神圣的牧师以及一切德高望重的人们走道他们身边时，纷纷敬畏地向后退避。这支队伍出现在市场时，人群中进发出一阵欢呼，向他们致意。这种欢呼无疑额外增加了声势，表明了当年人们对其统治者孩提式的忠诚，但也让人感到，仍在听众耳际回荡的高度紧张的雄辩布道所激起的热情借此而不可遏止地爆发。每一个人不但自身感到了这种冲动，而且也从旁边的人身上感受到了程度相当的冲动。在教堂里的时候，这种冲动已经难以遏制；如今到了露天，便扶摇直冲云霄。这里有足够多的人，也有足够高的激昂交汇鲍情感，可以发出比狂风的呼啸、闪电的雷鸣或大海的咆哮更为震撼人心的声响；众心结成一心，形成一致的冲动，众声融成一声，发出巨大的浪涛声。在新英格兰的土壤中还从未进发出这样响彻云霄的欢呼！在新英格兰的土地上还从未站立过一个人象这位布道师那样受到他的人间兄弟的如此尊崇！
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_672');"><p>How fared it with him, then?  Were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head?  So etherealised by spirit as he was, and so apotheosised by worshipping admirers, did his footsteps, in the procession, really tread upon the dust of earth? 
</p></origin><translate id="div_672" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那么他本人又如何呢？他头上的空中不是有光环在光芒四射吗？他既然被神灵感化得如此空灵，为崇拜者奉若神明，他那在队伍中移动着的脚步，当真是踏在尘埃之上吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_673');"><p>As the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward, all eyes were turned towards the point where the minister was seen to approach among them.  The shout died into a murmur, as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpse of him. How feeble and pale he looked, amid all his triumph!  The energy--or say, rather, the inspiration which had held him up, until he should have delivered the sacred message that had brought its own strength along with it from heaven--was withdrawn, now that it had so faithfully performed its office. The glow, which they had just before beheld burning on his cheek, was extinguished, like a flame that sinks down hopelessly among the late decaying embers.  It seemed hardly the face of a man alive, with such a death-like hue: it was hardly a man with life in him, that tottered on his path so nervously, yet tottered, and did not fall! 
</p></origin><translate id="div_673" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>军人和文官的队伍向前行进的时候，所有的目光全都投向牧师在大队中慢慢走来的方向。随着人群中一部分又一部分的人瞥见了他的身影，欢呼声渐渐乎息为一种喃喃声。他在大获全胜之际，看起来是多么虚弱和苍白啊！他的精力——或者毋宁说，那个支撑着他传达完神圣的福音并由上天借此赋予他该福音本身的力量的神启——在他忠诚地克尽厥责之后，已经被撤回去了。人们刚才看到的在他面颊上烧灼的红光已经黯淡，犹如在余烬中无可奈何地熄灭的火焰。他脸色那样死灰，实在不象一个活人的面孔；他那样无精打采地踉跄着，实在不象一个体内尚有生命的人；然而他还在跌跌撞撞地前进着，居然没有倒下！
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_674');"><p>One of his clerical brethren--it was the venerable John Wilson--observing the state in which Mr. Dimmesdale was left by the retiring wave of intellect and sensibility, stepped forward hastily to offer his support.  The minister tremulously, but decidedly, repelled the old man's arm.  He still walked onward, if that movement could be so described, which rather resembled the wavering effort of an infant, with its mother's arms in view, outstretched to tempt him forward.  And now, almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress, he had come opposite the well-remembered and weather-darkened scaffold, where, long since, with all that dreary lapse of time between, Hester Prynne had encountered the world's ignominious stare. There stood Hester, holding little Pearl by the hand!  And there was the scarlet letter on her breast!  The minister here made a pause; although the music still played the stately and rejoicing march to which the procession moved.  It summoned him onward--inward to the festival!--but here he made a pause. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_674" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的一位担任教职的兄弟，就是年长的约翰，威尔逊，观察到了丁梅斯代尔先生在智慧和敏感退潮之后陷入的状态，慌忙迈步上前来搀扶他。而丁梅斯代尔牧师却哆里哆嗦地断然推开了那老人的胳臂。他还继续朝前“走”着——如果我们还把那种动作说成是“走”的话，其实更象一个婴儿看到了母亲在前面伸出双手来鼓励自己前进时那种播摇晃晃的学步。此时，牧师已经茫茫然，不知移步迈向何方，他来到了记忆犹新的那座因风吹日晒雨淋而发黑的刑台对面，在相隔许多凄风苦雨的岁月之前，海丝特·白兰曾经在那上面遭到世人轻辱的白眼。现在海丝特就站在那儿，手中领着小珠儿！而红字就在她胸前！牧师走到这里停下了脚步，然而，音乐依然庄严地演奏着，队伍合着欢快的进行曲继续向前移动。乐声召唤他向前进，乐声召唤他去赴宴！但是他却停了下来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_675');"><p>Bellingham, for the last few moments, had kept an anxious eye upon him.  He now left his own place in the procession, and advanced to give assistance judging, from Mr. Dimmesdale's aspect that he must otherwise inevitably fall.  But there was something in the latter's expression that warned back the magistrate, although a man not readily obeying the vague intimations that pass from one spirit to another.  The crowd, meanwhile, looked on with awe and wonder.  This earthly faintness, was, in their view, only another phase of the minister's celestial strength; nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be wrought for one so holy, had he ascended before their eyes, waxing dimmer and brighter, and fading at last into the light of heaven! 
</p></origin><translate id="div_675" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>贝灵汉在这几分钟里始终焦虑地注视着他。此时贝灵汉离开了队伍中自己的位置，走上前来帮助他，因为从丁梅斯代尔先生的面容来判断，不去扶他一把就一定会摔倒的。但是，牧师的表情中有一种推拒之意，令这位达官不敢上前，尽管他并不是那种乐于听命于人与人之间心息相通的隐约暗示的人。与此同时，人群则怀着谅惧参半的心情观望着。在他们看来，这种肉体的衰竭只不过是牧师的神力的另一种表现；设若象他这样神圣的人，就在众人眼前飞升，渐黯又渐明，最终消失在天国的光辉中，也不会被视为难以企及的奇迹。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_676');"><p>He turned towards the scaffold, and stretched forth his arms. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_676" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他转向刑台，向前伸出双臂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_677');"><p>"Hester," said he, "come hither!  Come, my little Pearl!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_677" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“海丝特，”他说，“过来呀！来，我的小珠儿！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_678');"><p>It was a ghastly look with which he regarded them; but there was something at once tender and strangely triumphant in it.  The child, with the bird-like motion, which was one of her characteristics, flew to him, and clasped her arms about his knees.  Hester Prynne--slowly, as if impelled by inevitable fate, and against her strongest will--likewise drew near, but paused before she reached him.  At this instant old Roger Chillingworth thrust himself through the crowd--or, perhaps, so dark, disturbed, and evil was his look, he rose up out of some nether region--to snatch back his victim from what he sought to do!  Be that as it might, the old man rushed forward, and caught the minister by the arm. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_678" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他盯着她们的眼神十分可怖；但其中马上就映出温柔和奇异的胜利的成分。那孩子，以她特有的鸟儿一般的动作，朝他飞去，还搂住了他的双膝。海丝特·白兰似乎被必然的命运所推动，但又违背她的坚强意志，也缓缓向前，只是在她够不到他的地方就站住了。就在此刻，老罗杰·齐灵渥斯从人群中脱颖而出——由于他的脸色十分阴暗、十分慌乱、十分邪恶，或许可以说他是从地狱的什么地方钻出来的——想要抓住他的牺牲品，以免他会做出什么举动！无论如何吧，反正那老人冲到前面，一把抓住了牧师的胳臂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_679');"><p>"Madman, hold!  what is your purpose?" whispered he.  "Wave back that woman!  Cast off this child!  All shall be well!  Do not blacken your fame, and perish in dishonour!  I can yet save you! Would you bring infamy on your sacred profession?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_679" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“疯子，稳住！你要干什么？”他小声说。“挥开那女人！甩开这孩子！一切都会好的！不要玷污你的名声，不光彩地毁掉自己！我还能拯救你！你愿意给你神圣的职业蒙受耻辱吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_680');"><p>"Ha, tempter!  Methinks thou art too late!" answered the minister, encountering his eye, fearfully, but firmly.  "Thy power is not what it was!  With God's help, I shall escape thee now!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_680" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哈，诱惑者啊！我认为你来得太迟了！”牧师畏惧而坚定地对着他的目光，回答说。“你的权力如今已不象以前了！有了上帝的帮助，我现在要逃脱你的羁绊了！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_681');"><p>He again extended his hand to the woman of the scarlet letter. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_681" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他又一次向戴红字的女人伸出了手。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_682');"><p>"Hester Prynne," cried he, with a piercing earnestness, "in the name of Him, so terrible and so merciful, who gives me grace, at this last moment, to do what--for my own heavy sin and miserable agony--I withheld myself from doing seven years ago, come hither now, and twine thy strength about me!  Thy strength, Hester; but let it be guided by the will which God hath granted me!  This wretched and wronged old man is opposing it with all his might!--with all his own might, and the fiend's!  Come, Hester--come!  Support me up yonder scaffold." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_682" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“海丝特·白兰，”他以令人撕心裂肺的真诚呼叫道，“上帝啊，他是那样的可畏，又是那样的仁慈，在这最后的时刻，他已恩准我——为了我自己沉重的罪孽和悲惨的痛楚——来做七年前我规避的事情，现在过来吧，把你的力量缠绕到我身上吧！你的力量，海丝特；但要让那力量遵从上帝赐于我的意愿的指导！这个遭受委屈的不幸的老人正在竭力反对此事！竭尽他自己的，以及魔鬼的全力！来吧，海丝特，来吧！扶我登上这座刑台吧！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_683');"><p>The crowd was in a tumult.  The men of rank and dignity, who stood more immediately around the clergyman, were so taken by surprise, and so perplexed as to the purport of what they saw--unable to receive the explanation which most readily presented itself, or to imagine any other--that they remained silent and inactive spectators of the judgement which Providence seemed about to work.  They beheld the minister, leaning on Hester's shoulder, and supported by her arm around him, approach the scaffold, and ascend its steps; while still the little hand of the sin-born child was clasped in his.  Old Roger Chillingworth followed, as one intimately connected with the drama of guilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors, and well entitled, therefore to be present at its closing scene. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_683" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>人群哗然，骚动起来。那些紧靠在牧师身边站着的有地位和身分的人万分震惊，对他们目睹的这一切实在不解：既不能接受那显而易见的解释，又想不出别的什么涵义，只好保持沉默，静观上天似乎就要进行的裁决。他们眼睁睁地瞅着牧师靠在海丝特的肩上，由她用臂膀搀扶着走近刑台，跨上台阶；而那个由罪孽而诞生的孩子的小手还在他的手中紧握着。老罗杰·齐灵渥斯紧随在后，象是与这出他们几人一齐参加演出的罪恶和悲伤的戏剧密不可分，因此也就责无旁贷地在闭幕前亮了相。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_684');"><p>"Hadst thou sought the whole earth over," said he looking darkly at the clergyman, "there was no one place so secret--no high place nor lowly place, where thou couldst have escaped me--save on this very scaffold!"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_686');"><p>Yet he trembled, and turned to Hester, with an expression of doubt and anxiety in his eyes, not the less evidently betrayed, that there was a feeble smile upon his lips. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_686" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而他却颤抖着，转向海丝特，眼睛中流露着疑虑的神色，嘴角上也同样明显地带着一丝无力的微笑。

</p></origin><translate id="div_689" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“至于你和珠儿，听凭上帝的旨意吧，”牧师说；“而上帝是仁慈的！上帝已经在我眼前表明了他的意愿，我现在就照着去做。海丝特，我已经是个垂死的人了。那就让我赶紧承担起我的耻辱吧！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_690');"><p>Partly supported by Hester Prynne, and holding one hand of little Pearl's, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale turned to the dignified and venerable rulers; to the holy ministers, who were his brethren; to the people, whose great heart was thoroughly appalled yet overflowing with tearful sympathy, as knowing that some deep life-matter--which, if full of sin, was full of anguish and repentance likewise--was now to be laid open to them.  The sun, but little past its meridian, shone down upon the clergyman, and gave a distinctness to his figure, as he stood out from all the earth, to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of Eternal Justice.

At last--at last!--I stand upon the spot where, seven years since, I should have stood, here, with this woman, whose arm, more than the little strength wherewith I have crept hitherward, sustains me at this dreadful moment, from grovelling down upon my face!  Lo, the scarlet letter which Hester wears!  Ye have all shuddered at it!  Wherever her walk hath been--wherever, so miserably burdened, she may have hoped to find repose--it hath cast a lurid gleam of awe and horrible repugnance round about her.  But there stood one in the midst of you, at whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered!"

But he fought back the bodily weakness--and, still more, the faintness of heart--that was striving for the mastery with him.  He threw off all assistance, and stepped passionately forward a pace before the woman and the children.

The angels were for ever pointing at it! (The Devil knew it well, and fretted it continually with the touch of his burning finger!) But he hid it cunningly from men, and walked among you with the mien of a spirit, mournful, because so pure in a sinful world!--and sad, because he missed his heavenly kindred!  Now, at the death-hour, he stands up before you!  He bids you look again at Hester's scarlet letter!  He tells you, that, with all its mysterious horror, it is but the shadow of what he bears on his own breast, and that even this, his own red stigma, is no more than the type of what has seared his inmost heart!  Stand any here that question God's judgment on a sinner!  Behold!  Behold, a dreadful witness of it!"

But it were irreverent to describe that revelation.  For an instant, the gaze of the horror-stricken multitude was concentrated on the ghastly miracle; while the minister stood, with a flush of triumph in his face, as one who, in the crisis of acutest pain, had won a victory.  Then, down he sank upon the scaffold!  Hester partly raised him, and supported his head against her bosom.  Old Roger Chillingworth knelt down beside him, with a blank, dull countenance, out of which the life seemed to have departed.

The great scene of grief, in which the wild infant bore a part had developed all her sympathies; and as her tears fell upon her father's cheek, they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow, nor forever do battle with the world, but be a woman in it.  Towards her mother, too, Pearl's errand as a messenger of anguish was fulfilled.

It may be, that, when we forgot our God--when we violated our reverence each for the other's soul--it was thenceforth vain to hope that we could meet hereafter, in an everlasting and pure reunion.  God knows; and He is merciful!  He hath proved his mercy, most of all, in my afflictions.  By giving me this burning torture to bear upon my breast!  By sending yonder dark and terrible old man, to keep the torture always at red-heat!  By bringing me hither, to die this death of triumphant ignominy before the people!  Had either of these agonies been wanting, I had been lost for ever!  Praised be His name!  His will be done!  Farewell!"
