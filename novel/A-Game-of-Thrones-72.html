</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6655');"><p>It seemed a thousand years ago that Catelyn Stark had carried her infant son out of Riverrun, crossing the Tumblestone in a small boat to begin their journey north to Winterfell. And it was across the Tumblestone that they came home now, though the boy wore plate and mail in place of swaddling clothes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6655" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>多年以前，凯特琳怀抱襁褓里的儿子，离开奔流城，搭乘小船渡过腾石河，北上临冬城。而今想起来，仿佛是千年前的事。而今，他们同样渡过腾石河，重返家园，然而当初那个婴儿，已经长成了披甲戴剑的英挺战士。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6656');"><p>Robb sat in the bow with Grey Wind, his hand resting on his direwolf s head as the rowers pulled at their oars. Theon Greyjoy was with him. Her uncle Brynden would come behind in the second boat, with the Greatjon and Lord Karstark.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6656" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>划桨起起落落，罗柏和灰风坐在船首，他把手放在冰原狼的头上，席恩•葛雷乔伊陪伴着他。布林登叔叔坐在后面的第二艘船上，与大琼恩和卡史塔克伯爵一道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6657');"><p>Catelyn took a place toward the stern. They shot down the Tumblestone, letting the strong current push them past the looming Wheel Tower. The splash and rumble of the great waterwheel within was a sound from her girlhood that brought a sad smile to Catelyn’s face. From the sandstone walls of the castle, soldiers and servants shouted down her name, and Robb’s, and "Winterfell!" From every rampart waved the banner of House Tully: a leaping trout, silver, against a rippling blue-and-red field. It was a stirring sight, yet it did not lift her heart. She wondered if indeed her heart would ever lift again. Oh, Ned?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6657" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳坐在船尾，他们乘船顺流而下，任腾石河强劲的水流载着他们经过高大的水车塔。塔内巨大水车辘辘轮转，水声哗啦，儿时种种回1 艺牵起凯特琳嘴角一抹哀伤的微笑。城中军民排列在砂岩城墙上，高喊着他们母子的名字，高喊着“临冬城万岁!”每一座壁垒上都飘扬着徒利家族的旗臶：一尾腾跃的银色鳟鱼，衬着波动的红蓝底色。这是一幅令人振奋的景象，然而凯特琳的心却高兴不起来，她怀疑自己的心这辈子还能不能再感受喜悦。噢，奈德……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6658');"><p>Below the Wheel Tower, they made a wide turn and knifed through the churning water. The men put their backs into it. The wide arch of the Water Gate came into view, and she heard the creak of heavy chains as the great iron portcullis was winched upward. It rose slowly as they approached, and Catelyn saw that the lower half of it was red with rust. The bottom foot dripped brown mud on them as they passed underneath, the barbed spikes mere inches above their heads. Catelyn gazed up at the bars and wondered how deep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it ought to be replaced. Thoughts like that were seldom far from her mind these days.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6658" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们在水车塔下转了个大弯，直直地穿越汹涌河水，船夫使劲划桨，水门的巨大拱形映入眼帘，她听见绞链的卷动，巨大的铁闸门缓缓升起。当他们逐渐接近，凯特琳发现闸门下半部几乎全是红色铁锈，它们长年浸在水中，“水门”正是因此而得名。穿过闸门时，褐色烂泥不住滴下，门底尖刺距离头顶仅有几寸。凯特琳抬头看着铁栅，不禁纳闷其锈蚀的程度有多严重，若是遇上撞锤，这道闸门又究竟能撑多久，到底该不该换新的?这些日子以来，她脑中所想尽是这类事情。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6659');"><p>They passed beneath the arch and under the walls, moving from sunlight to shadow and back into sunlight. Boats large and small were tied up all around them, secured to iron rings set in the stone. Her father’s guards waited on the water stair with her brother. Ser Edmure Tully was a stocky young man with a shaggy head of auburn hair and a fiery beard. His breastplate was scratched and dented from battle, his blue-and-red cloak stained by blood and smoke. At his side stood the Lord Tytos Blackwood, a hard pike of a man with close-cropped salt-and-pepper whiskers and a hook nose. His bright yellow armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vine-and-leaf patterns, and a cloak sewn from raven feathers draped his thin shoulders. It had been Lord Tytos who led the sortie that plucked her brother from the Lannister camp.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6659" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们穿过拱门和城墙，从阳光下走进阴影中，接着又回到日光照耀下。四周停泊着大小船只，均稳固地系在石中铁环上。弟弟正带着父亲的卫士们在临水阶梯上等候他们。艾德慕•徒利爵士是个体格壮硕的年轻人，一蓬枣红头发，一把火红胡须，胸甲上尽是战争遗留的刮痕和凹陷，红蓝披风沾染了血渍与烟尘。站在他身边的是泰陀斯•布莱伍德伯爵，身躯硬挺，留了短短的灰胡子，生了个鹰钩鼻，亮黄色的盔甲上用黑玉镶成繁复的藤蔓图案，削瘦的肩膀上垂着鸦羽披风。率兵出城突击，将弟弟从兰尼斯特军营地里救出来的人，正是泰陀斯伯爵。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6660');"><p>"Bring them in," Ser Edmure commanded. Three men scrambled down the stairs knee-deep in the water and pulled the boat close with long hooks. When Grey Wind bounded out, one of them dropped his pole and lurched back, stumbling and sitting down abruptly in the river. The others laughed, and the man got a sheepish look on his face. Theon Greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted Catelyn by the waist, setting her on a dry step above him as water lapped around his boots.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6660" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“带他们进来。”艾德慕爵士下令。三个人步下阶梯，走到及膝深的水里，用长钩把小艇拉过去。灰风一跃而出，却将对方一人吓得慌忙后退，步履踉跄，跌坐水中，众人哈哈大笑，那人则露出难为情的表情。席恩•葛雷乔伊跳到船边，将凯特琳拦腰抱到干燥的石阶上，任凭流水拍打他的靴子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6661');"><p>Edmure came down the steps to embrace her. "Sweet sister," he murmured hoarsely. He had deep blue eyes and a mouth made for smiles, but he was not smiling now. He looked worn and tired, battered by battle and haggard from strain. His neck was bandaged where he had taken a wound. Catelyn hugged him fiercely.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6661" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾德慕走下阶梯拥抱她。“亲爱的姐姐。”他哑着嗓子说。他生了一对深邃的蓝眼睛，那双唇天生便该用来微笑，只是现在他却笑不出来。他的模样筋疲力竭，因为一连串的战争、压力而显得憔悴不堪，脖子上受伤的地方还绑了绷带。凯特琳紧紧地搂住他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6662');"><p>"Your grief is mine, Cat," he said when they broke apart. "When we heard about Lord Eddard?.?.?.?the Lannisters will pay, I swear it, you will have your vengeance."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6662" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“凯特，我和你一样难过。”他们分开时，他这么说，“当我们听说艾德大人出事的时候……兰尼斯特家会付出代价的，我对天发誓，一定为你复仇雪恨。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6663');"><p>"Will that bring Ned back to me?" she said sharply. The wound was still too fresh for softer words. She could not think about Ned now. She would not. It would not do. She had to be strong. "All that will keep. I must see Father."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6663" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那能让奈德活过来吗?”她语气尖锐地说。伤口还太新，听不得安慰的话语。现在她无法去想与奈德有关的事，也不愿去想。这样是不行的，她必须坚强。“这些以后再说，我要去见父亲。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6664');"><p>"He awaits you in his solar," Edmure said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6664" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他正在书房里等你。”艾德慕道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6665');"><p>"Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady," her father’s steward explained. When had that good man grown so old and grey? "He instructed me to bring you to him at once."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6665" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，霍斯特大人卧病在床。”父亲的总管解释。这好人何时变得如此灰白苍老? “他吩咐我立刻带您去见他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6666');"><p>"I’ll take her." Edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower bailey, where Petyr Baelish and Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for her favor. The massive sandstone walls of the keep loomed above them. As they pushed through a door between two guardsmen in fish-crest helms, she asked, "How bad is he?" dreading the answer even as she said the words.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6666" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“让我带她去。”艾德慕陪着她步上临水阶梯，穿越下层庭院，培提尔和布兰登•史塔克就在那里为她拼斗过。巍峨的砂岩城墙高耸于头顶，他推开由一道两名头戴鱼纹盔的卫土把守的门，她借机询问：“他的情形有多坏?”她一边说，心里一边害怕即将听到的答案。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6667');"><p>Edmure’s look was somber. "He will not be with us long, the maesters say. The pain is?.?.?.?constant, and grievous."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6667" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾德慕神情严肃。“学士说他在人世的时间不长了。病痛时常发作……而且相当厉害。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6668');"><p>A blind rage filled her, a rage at all the world; at her brother Edmure and her sister Lysa, at the Lannisters, at the maesters, at Ned and her father and the monstrous gods who would take them both away from her. "You should have told me," she said. "You should have sent word as soon as you knew."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6668" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一股无名怒火陡然充斥了她的内心，她痛恨这整个世界，痛恨弟弟艾德慕和妹妹莱沙，痛恨兰尼斯特家族，痛恨学士，痛恨奈德和父亲，尤其痛恨将他俩自她身边夺走的狰狞诸神。“你应该早点告诉我，”她说，“你知道情形就应该跟我说。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6669');"><p>"He forbade it. He did not want his enemies to know that he was dying. With the realm so troubled, he feared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he was?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6669" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是他不准，他不想让敌人知道自己将不久人世。眼下王国如此动乱，若是兰尼斯特家知道他这么虚弱，他怕他们会……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6670');"><p>"?.?.?.?they might attack?" Catelyn finished, hard. It was your doing, yours, a voice whispered inside her. If you had not taken it upon yourself to seize the dwarf?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6670" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“……出兵进攻厂凯特琳艰难地替他说完。一切都是你的错，你的错啊，她心中有个声音在说，假如你没有头脑发热，逮捕那侏儒…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6671');"><p>They climbed the spiral stair in silence.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6671" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们沉默地登上螺旋梯。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6672');"><p>The keep was three-sided, like Riverrun itself, and Lord Hoster’s solar was triangular as well, with a stone balcony that jutted out to the east like the prow of some great sandstone ship. From there the lord of the castle could look down on his walls and battlements, and beyond, to where the waters met. They had moved her father’s bed out onto the balcony. "He likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers," Edmure explained. "Father, see who I’ve brought. Cat has come to see you?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6672" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>主堡和奔流城本身一样是三边造型，霍斯特公爵的书房也是三角形，东边有一突出的石臸阳台，像是一艘巨大砂岩舰只的船首。从那里，公爵大人可将自己的城墙、堡垒和对面河流交界处尽收眼底。父亲的床已被移到阳台上。“他喜欢晒太阳，观看河上风景。”艾德慕解释，“父亲，看看我带谁来了? 凯特来看您了……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6673');"><p>Hoster Tully had always been a big man; tall and broad in his youth, portly as he grew older. Now he seemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off his bones. Even his face sagged. The last time Catelyn had seen him, his hair and beard had been brown, well streaked with grey. Now they had gone white as snow.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6673" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>霍斯特•徒利一向体形硕大：年轻时高大魁梧，步入老年后则显得有些臃肿。然而如今的他看起来却似乎有点萎缩，全身肌肉都融进了骨头，脸庞是那么干瘪。凯特琳上次见他时，他的头发和胡子还是棕褐里带了点灰，如今却整个变成了雪白。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6674');"><p>His eyes opened to the sound of Edmure’s voice. "Little cat," he murmured in a voice thin and wispy and wracked by pain. "My little cat." A tremulous smile touched his face as his hand groped for hers. "I watched for you?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6674" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>听到艾德慕的声音，他睁开眼睛。“小凯特，”声音细小，充满痛苦，“我的小凯特。”他脸上露出一抹颤巍巍的微笑，他摸索着要握她的手。“我在等你哪……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6675');"><p>"I shall leave you to talk," her brother said, kissing their lord father gently on the brow before he withdrew.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6675" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们谈吧。”说着弟弟轻轻吻了父亲大人的额头，然后转身离开。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6676');"><p>Catelyn knelt and took her father’s hand in hers. It was a big hand, but fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the strength gone from it. "You should have told me," she said. "A rider, a raven?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6676" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳跪下来，握住父亲的手。那手从前虽大，如今却显得枯槁，皮肤松垮垮地覆盖着骨头，早巳丧失了所有的力量。“您早该跟我说，”她说，“派人送信，或是叫乌儿……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6677');"><p>"Riders are taken, questioned," he answered. "Ravens are brought down?.?.?.?" A spasm of pain took him, and his fingers clutched hers hard. "The crabs are in my belly?.?.?.?pinching, always pinching. Day and night. They have fierce claws, the crabs. Maester Vyman makes me dreamwine, milk of the poppy?.?.?.?I sleep a lot?.?.?.?but I wanted to be awake to see you, when you came. I was afraid?.?.?.?when the Lannisters took your brother, the camps all around us?.?.?.?was afraid I would go, before I could see you again?.?.?.?I was afraid?.?.?.?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_6677" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“使者会被抓，被严刑逼供，”他回答，“渡鸦会被舐下来……”一阵剧痛突然袭来，他的指头紧紧抓住她的手。“螃蟹在我肚子里……夹啊夹，夹个不停，日夜不休地夹。他们的钳子好生锐利啊，这些螃蟹。韦曼师傅调了梦酒给我喝，还有罂粟花奶……所以我睡得很多……但你来的时候，我一定要醒着，好好看看你。兰尼斯特家抓走你弟弟那会儿……我好害怕……到处是他们的营地……我好怕我就这么走了，没机会再见你一面……我好怕……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6678');"><p>"I’m here, Father," she said. "With Robb, my son. He’ll want to see you too."

Ser Marq Piper was with him, and they brought a Darry, Ser Raymun’s son, a lad no older than Bran.

Lord Blackwood would have none of it. They should finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood. March to Harrenhal and bring Roose Bolton’s army down as well.

If I must trade our four Lannisters for their two Starks, I will call that a bargain and thank the gods. I want you safe, Robb, ruling at Winterfell from your father’s seat. I want you to live your life, to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son. I want to write an end to this. I want to go home, my lords, and weep for my husband."

They had almost listened, almost?.?.?.?but the moment was gone. There would be no peace, no chance to heal, no safety. She looked at her son, watched him as he listened to the lords debate, frowning, troubled, yet wedded to his war. He had pledged himself to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, but she saw his true bride plain before her now: the sword he had laid on the table.

" Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne? What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods are wrong. The Others take the Lannisters too, I’ve had a bellyful of them." He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword. "Why shouldn’t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead!" He pointed at Robb with the blade. "There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m’lords," he thundered. "The King in the North!"
