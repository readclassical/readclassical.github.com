</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6530');"><p>The mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch. "Easy, sweet lady," he said in a soft voice, quieting her with a touch. Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead breath on his face, but Jon paid it no mind. He strapped his roll to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy. "Ghost," he called softly, "to me." And the wolf was there, eyes like embers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6530" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩•雪诺扎紧马鞍上的皮带，母马则轻声嘶叫。“好女孩，别怕，”他轻声安抚它。寒风在马厩间细语，宛如迎面袭击来的冰冷死气，但琼恩未加理会。他把铺盖捆上马鞍，结疤的手指僵硬而笨拙。“白灵，”他轻声呼唤，“过来。”狼立刻出现，双眼如两团火烬。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6531');"><p>"Jon, please. You must not do this."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6531" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“琼恩，求求你，别这样。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6532');"><p>He mounted, the reins in his hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the night. Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door, a full moon peering over his shoulder. He threw a giant’s shadow, immense and black. "Get out of my way, Sam."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6532" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他骑上马，握紧缰绳，策马转头，面对黑夜。山姆威尔•塔利站在马厩门口，一轮满月从他肩膀后照进，洒下一道巨人般的影子，硕大而黑暗。“山姆，别挡道。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6533');"><p>"Jon, you can’t," Sam said. "I won’t let you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6533" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“琼恩，你不能这样一走了之，”山姆说，“我不会放你走。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6534');"><p>"I would sooner not hurt you," Jon told him. "Move aside, Sam, or I’ll ride you down."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6534" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不想伤害你，”琼恩告诉他，“山姆，你走开，不然我就踩过去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6535');"><p>"You won’t. You have to listen to me. Please?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6535" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你不会的。听我说，求求你……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6536');"><p>Jon put his spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door. For an instant Sam stood his ground, his face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his mouth a widening O of surprise. At the last moment, when they were almost on him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and fell. The mare leapt over him, out into the night.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6536" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩双脚一踢，母马立即朝门飞奔而去。刹那间，山姆站在原地，脸庞如同身后那轮满月般又圆又白，嘴巴惊讶地张成一个大圆。就在人马即将撞上的最后一刻，他跳了开去，并如琼恩所预料地，步履踉跄，跌倒在地。母马跳过他，冲进黑夜。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6537');"><p>Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head. Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side. Men watched from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south. No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables. He hoped Sam hadn’t hurt himself, falling like that. He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way. "I warned him," Jon said aloud. "It was nothing to do with him, anyway." He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers. They still pained him, but it felt good to have the wrappings off.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6537" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩掀起厚重斗篷的兜帽，拍拍母马的头。他骑马离开静谧的黑城堡，白灵紧随在旁。他知道身后的长城上有人值守，但他们面朝极北，而非南方。除了正从马厩的泥地上挣扎起身的山姆•塔利，不会有人见到他离去。眼看山姆摔成那样，琼恩暗自希望他没事才好。他那么肥胖，手脚又笨拙，很可能因此摔断手腕，或扭到脚踝。“我警告过他了，”琼恩大声说，“而且本来就不干他的事。”他一边骑，一边活动自己灼伤的手，结疤的指头开开阖阖。疼痛依旧，不过取掉绷带后的感觉真好。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6538');"><p>Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad. He needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone. On the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was more important than deception. It was not as though they would not guess where he was going.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6538" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他沿着蝴蝶结般蜿蜒的国王大道飞奔，月光将附近的丘陵洒成一片银白。他得在计划被人发觉前尽可能地远离长城。等到明天，他将被迫离开道路，穿越田野、树：丛和溪流以摆脱追兵，但眼下速度比掩护更重要。毕竟他的目的地显而易见。：
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6539');"><p>The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall?.?.?.?if Sam Tarly did not betray him. The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a brother. If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King’s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6539" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>熊老习惯黎明起床，所以琼恩至少还有天亮前的时间，用来尽量拉开与长城间：的距离……假定山姆•塔利没有背叛他。胖男孩虽然尽忠职守，且胆子又小，但；他把琼恩当亲兄弟看待。若是被人间起，山姆肯定会说出实情，不过琼恩不认为他 有那个勇气，敢大半夜去找国王塔的守卫，把莫尔蒙吵醒。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6540');"><p>When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear’s breakfast from the kitchen, they’d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him. Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when he fled in disgrace. Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade. Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man. He knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son’s disgrace. That seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust, but it couldn’t be helped. No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were betraying someone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6540" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等到明天，发现琼恩没去厨房帮熊老端早餐，大家便会到寝室来查找，随后看到孤零零躺在床上的长爪。留下那把宝剑很不容易，但琼恩还不至于恬不知耻地将它带走。就连乔拉•莫尔蒙亡命天涯前，也没有这么做。莫尔蒙司令一定能找到更适合佩带那把剑的人。想起老人，琼恩心里很不好受。他知道自己这样弃营逃跑，无异是在总司令丧子之痛上洒盐。想到他对自己如此信任，这实在是忘恩负义的作法，但他别无选择。不管怎么做，琼恩都会背叛某个人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6541');"><p>Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron had it easier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods’ will and help sort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6541" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>即使到了现在，他依旧不知自己的做法是否荣誉。南方人的作派比较简单，他们有修士可供咨询，由他们传达诸神意旨，协助理清对错。然而史塔克家族信奉的是无名古神，心树就算听见了，也不会言语。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6542');"><p>When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk. He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through. There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6542" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当黑城堡的最后一丝灯火消失在身后，琼恩便放慢速度，让母马缓步而行。眼前还有漫漫长路，他却只有这匹马可供依凭。往南的路上，沿途都有村庄农舍，如有必要，他可以和他们交换新的马匹，不过若是母马受伤或瘫倒在地就不成了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6543');"><p>He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he’d need to steal them. He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak. His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail. Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken. A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be watching for him. Once Maester Aemon’s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe haven. Not even at Winterfell. Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense. He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should. Better not to call there at all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6543" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他得尽快找到新衣服，恐怕还只能去偷。眼下的他从头到脚都是黑色高统黑皮革马靴，粗布黑长裤黑外衣，无袖黑皮革背心，厚重的黑羊毛披风。长剑和匕首包在黑鞘里，鞍袋里则是黑环甲和头盔。如果他被捕，这每一件都足以致他于死地。在颈泽以北，任何穿黑衣的陌生人进了村舍庄园，都会被投以冷漠的怀疑眼光，并遭到监视。而一旦伊蒙师傅的渡鸦送出消息，自己便再也找不到容身之所，即便临冬城也一样。布兰或许会放他进城，但鲁温师傅很清楚该怎么做，他会履行职责，关上城门，把琼恩赶走。所以，打一开始他就没动临冬城的主意。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6544');"><p>Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind’s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father’s solar, the turret room where he had slept. Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage’s beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6544" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>虽然如此，在他脑海里，却能清晰地见到城堡的影像，仿佛昨天才刚离开：高耸的大理石墙；香气四溢、烟雾弥漫的城堡大厅，里面到处是乱跑的狗；父亲的书房；自己在塔楼上的卧室。在他心底的某一部分，只想再瞧瞧布兰的欢笑，再吃一个盖奇做的牛肉培根派，再听老奶妈说关于森林之子和傻瓜佛罗理安的故事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6545');"><p>But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his father’s son, and Robb’s brother. The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont. Nor was he Aemon Targaryen. Three times the old man had chosen, and three times he had chosen honor, but that was him. Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven, or because he was strong and true. Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6545" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可是，他并非因为这些才离开长城：他之所以离开，只因为他是父亲的儿子，罗柏的兄弟。他不会因为别人送他一把剑，即便像长爪那么好的剑，就变成莫尔蒙家族的人。他也不是伊蒙•坦格利安。老人做了三次抉择，三次都选择了荣誉，但那是他。即便现在，琼恩还是不敢确定，老学士做出那样的选择，究竟是因为懦弱无力，还是因为心地坚强、忠于职守。但无论如何，他了解老人的困惑，关于抉择的痛苦，他太了解了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6546');"><p>Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was done with denials. He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned. For the rest of his life, however long that might be, he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name. Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man’s hand be raised against him. But it made no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother’s side and help avenge his father.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6546" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂•兰尼斯特曾说：多数人宁可否认事实，也不愿面对真相，但琼恩已经想透了种种磨难。他清楚地知道自己是谁：他是琼恩•雪诺，不但是私生子，更是背离誓约的逃兵，既无母亲，亦无朋友，将遭天谴。终其一生——不论他这一生能有多长——都将被迫流浪，成为阴影中沉默的孤民，不敢说出真名。无论走到七国何处，必将生活在谎言之中，否则别人会对他群起而攻之。但是，只要他能与兄弟并肩作战，为父亲报仇雪恨，所有这些都无足轻重。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6547');"><p>He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair. Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised. He tried to imagine the look on Robb’s face when he revealed himself. His brother would shake his head and smile, and he’d say?.?.?.?he’d say?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6547" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他记得自己最后一次见到罗柏的情景。当时罗柏站在广场上，红褐头发间雪花融化。如今琼恩可能必须易容之后，才能偷偷去见他。他试着想像当自己揭开真面目时，罗柏脸上会是什么表情。他的兄弟会摇摇头，面露微笑，然后他说……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6548');"><p>He could not see the smile. Hard as he tried, he could not see it. He found himself thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day they’d found the direwolves. "You said the words," Lord Eddard had told him. "You took a vow, before your brothers, before the old gods and the new." Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump. Bran’s eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand. He remembered the look on Father’s face when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6548" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他会说他拼凑不出那抹微笑，无论怎么努力，就是想不出来。他反而不自觉地想起他们找到冰原狼那天，被父亲砍头的逃兵。”你立下了誓言，”艾德公爵告诉那人，“你在你的弟兄们以及新旧诸神面前立下了誓约。”戴斯蒙和胖汤姆把逃兵拖到木桩前。布兰的眼睛睁得像盘子，琼恩还特意提醒他别让小马乱动。他记起当席恩•葛雷乔伊递上寒冰时，父亲脸上的表情，随后又想起鲜血溅落雪地，席恩扬腿把人头踢到他脚边。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6549');"><p>He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger. Would it have been any different? It must, surely, surely?.?.?.?and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty. He had to, or else?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6549" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他不禁想，假如逃兵是艾德公爵的亲弟弟班扬，而非一个衣着破烂的陌生人， 他会怎么做?两者会有差别吗?一定会，一定会的，一定……毫无疑问，罗柏也一定：会欢迎他。他怎么可能不欢迎他呢?除非……；
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6550');"><p>It did not bear thinking about. Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he clutched the reins. Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the kingsroad, as if to outrun his doubts. Jon was not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand. If he must perish, let it be with a sword in his hand, fighting his father’s killers. He was no true Stark, had never been one?.?.?.?but he could die like one. Let them say that Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6550" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>还是别多想的好。他握紧缰绳，手指隐隐作痛。琼恩再度夹紧马肚，顺着国王大：道疾驰，仿佛要驱离心中的疑惑。琼恩不怕死，但他不要这种被五花大绑，像个寻常：强盗般斩首示众的死法。倘若他非死不可，他甘愿手握利剑，死在与杀父仇人的决斗中。他生来就不是真正的史塔克族人，从来不是……但他可以死得像个史塔克。就让大家都知道艾德•史塔克膝下不只三个儿子，而是四个。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6551');"><p>Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, red tongue lolling from his mouth. Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed. The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight. He vanished behind, but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6551" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>白灵跟着他的速度跑了一里，红红的舌头伸在嘴巴外悬荡。他催马加速，人马低头飞奔。冰原狼则放慢脚步，停了下来，左顾右盼，眼睛在月色中闪着红光。不久，他消失在后方，琼恩知道他会按自己的步调跟随。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6552');"><p>Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the road: Mole’s Town. A dog barked as he rode through, and he heard a mule’s raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village was still. Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows, leaking between wooden slats, but only a few.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6552" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>前方的道路两旁，摇曳的灯火穿过树林照过来。这里是鼹鼠村。他催马奔过，听到一阵狗吠，以及马厩里传来的驴叫，除此之外，村子悄然无声。有几处炉火微光从禁闭的窗户中穿透而出，或自房舍木板间流泄出来，但寥寥无几。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6553');"><p>Mole’s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door. On the Wall, he’d heard men call the whores "buried treasures." He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6553" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其实鼹鼠村比乍看之下要大得多，只是四分之三的部分位于地底，由一个个既深且暖的地窖组成，经由错综复杂的隧道彼此衔接。就连妓院也在地下，从地面上看，它们只是比厕所大不了多少的小木屋，门上挂了盏红灯笼。长城上守军把妓女们叫做“地底的宝藏”，他不禁揣测今晚有多少黑衣弟兄在下面挖宝呢?这当然也算是一种背誓，只是无人在意。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6554');"><p>Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again. By then both he and the mare were damp with sweat. He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching. A bank of melting snow lay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, water trickling off to form small shallow pools. Jon squatted and brought his hands together, cupping the runoff between his fingers. The snowmelt was icy cold. He drank, and splashed some on his face, until his cheeks tingled. His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days, and his head was pounding too. I am doing the right thing, he told himself, so why do I feel so bad?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6554" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>直到把村子远远地抛在后面，琼恩方才再次减速。这时，他和母马都已经满身大汗。于是他跳下马背，只觉浑身发抖，灼伤的手更是疼痛。树丛下有大堆融雪，在月光下映舐发亮，涓滴细流从中淌出，汇聚成浅浅的小池。琼恩蹲下来，双手合掌，捧起雪水。融雪冰冷刺骨，他喝了几口，接着洗脸，直洗得两颊发麻。他感觉到头昏脑胀，手指也好几天没有痛得这么厉害。我做得没错，他告诉自己，可我为何这么难受?
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6555');"><p>The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while. The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone. That run had been truly stupid, an invitation to a broken neck. Jon wondered what had gotten into him. Was he in such a great rush to die?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6555" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>马儿仍旧气喘吁吁，于是琼恩牵它走了一段。道路很窄，只能勉强容两人并肩而骑，表面更被细小沟渠所切割，布满碎石。刚才那样狂奔委实愚蠢，分明就是自找麻烦，稍不小心就会摔断脖子。琼恩不禁纳闷，自己究竟怎么搞的? 就这么急着寻死么?
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6556');"><p>Off in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up. His mare whinnied nervously. Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around his mouth. "Ghost!" he shouted. "Ghost, to me." The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6556" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>远方的树林里传来动物的受惊尖叫，他立刻抬头，母马也不安地哼着。是他的狼找到猎物了?他把手环在嘴边，“白灵!”他叫道，“白灵！到我这儿来！”但惟一的回应只是身后某只猫头鹰振翅高飞的声响。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6557');"><p>Frowning, Jon continued on his way. He led the mare for half an hour, until she was dry. Ghost did not appear. Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he was concerned about his missing wolf. "Ghost," he called again. "Where are you? To me! Ghost!" Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even a half-grown direwolf, unless?.?.?.?no, Ghost was too smart to attack a bear, and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6557" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩皱起眉头，继续上路。他牵马走了半小时，直到它身上千透为止。但白灵始终没有出现。琼恩想上马赶路，却又担心不知去向的狼。“白灵，”他再度叫喊，“你在哪里?快过来!白灵!”这片林子里应该没什么能威胁到冰原狼——就算这只冰原狼尚未发育完全也罢，除非……不，白灵绝不会蠢到去攻击熊，而假使这附近有狼群，琼恩也一定能听见它们的嚎叫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6558');"><p>He should eat, he decided. Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up. There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept. In his saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple. He’d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he’d filched from the kitchens, but he would save the meat for the morrow. After it was gone he’d need to hunt, and that would slow him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6558" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>最后他决定先吃点东西再说。食物可以稍微安抚脾胃，更能多给白灵一点时间跟上。此时尚无危险，黑城堡依然在沉睡中。于是他从鞍袋里找出一块饼干，一小片乳酪和一个干瘪的褐色苹果。他还带了腌牛肉，以及从厨房偷来的一片培根，但他想把肉留到明天。因为等食物没了，他就得自己打猎，而那一定会拖延他的行程。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6559');"><p>Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad. He kept the apple for last. It had gone a little soft, but the flesh was still tart and juicy. He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses, and from the north. Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare. Could he outrun them? No, they were too close, they’d hear him for a certainty, and if they were from Castle Black?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6559" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩坐在树下，吃着饼干和乳酪，任母马沿着国王大道吃草。他把苹果留到最后，虽然摸起来有些软，果肉仍然酸甜多汁。听到声音时，他正在啃果核：是蹄声，从北方来。琼恩一跃而起，奔向母马。跑得掉吗?不，距离太近，一定会暴露声音，何况假如他们从黑城堡来……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6560');"><p>He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels. "Ouiet now," he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches. If the gods were kind, the riders would pass by.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6611');"><p>Of the ride back, Jon Snow remembered little. It seemed shorter than the journey south, perhaps because his mind was elsewhere. Pyp set the pace, galloping, walking, trotting, and then breaking into another gallop. Mole’s Town came and went, the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished. They made good time. Dawn was still an hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of them, dark against the pale immensity of the Wall. It did not seem like home this time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6611" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>回程途中发生过什么，琼恩•雪诺记得不多，只觉这趟路似乎比南行短暂得多，或许是他心不在焉的缘故罢。派普带队，不时飞奔，慢走，小跑，接着又恢复奔驰。鼹鼠村来了又去，妓院门口悬着的红灯早已熄灭。派普把时间掌握得很好，距离天亮刚好还有一个小时，琼恩见到黑城堡的黑塔楼出现在前方，衬着背后硕大无朋的苍白长城。只是这回，城堡再也没了家的感觉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6612');"><p>They could take him back, Jon told himself, but they could not make him stay. The war would not end on the morrow, or the day after, and his friends could not watch him day and night. He would bide his time, make them think he was content to remain here?.?.?.?and then, when they had grown lax, he would be off again. Next time he would avoid the kingsroad. He could follow the Wall east, perhaps all the way to the sea, a longer route but a safer one. Or even west, to the mountains, and then south over the high passes. That was the wildling’s way, hard and perilous, but at least no one wouid follow him. He wouldn’t stray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6612" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们可以抓他回去，琼恩告诉自己，但他们无法留住他。南方的战争不是一两天就能解决的事，而他的朋友不可能日夜都守着他。他只需耐心等待时机，让他们放松警惕，以为他心甘情愿留下来……然后就再度逃走。下一次，他不走国王大道，而是沿着长城东行，或许就这么一直走到海边，然后往南翻越崇山峻岭。那是野人们常走的路，崎岖难行，危机四伏，却足以摆脱追兵。从始至终，他与国王大道和临冬城都将保持一百里格以上的距离。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6616');"><p>When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn. Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear’s breakfast. Today it was three brown eggs boiled hard, with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums. Jon carried the food back to the King’s Tower. He found Mormont at the window seat, writing. His raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders, muttering, "Corn, corn, corn." The bird shrieked when Jon entered. "Put the food on the table," the Old Bear said, glancing up. "I’ll have some beer."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6616" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>天亮之后，琼恩像往常一样走进厨房。三指哈布把熊老的早餐交给他，什么也没说。今天的早餐包括三颗褐色的白煮蛋，油炸面包，火腿肉片以及一碗有些皱的李子。琼恩端着东西回到国王塔，发现莫尔蒙正坐在窗边写东西。乌鸦在他肩膀上来回踱步，边走边念：“玉米!玉米!玉米!”琼恩一进房间，乌鸦便提声尖叫。“把早餐放桌上。”熊老抬头道，“我还想喝点啤酒。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6617');"><p>Jon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, and filled a horn. Hobb had given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall. Jon crushed it in his fist. The juice trickled through his fingers. Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day, and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6617" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩打开一扇紧闭的窗户，从外面的窗台上拿了啤酒瓶，倒满一角杯。之前哈布给了他一个刚从长城储藏室里拿出来的柠檬，现下还是冰的。琼恩用拳头捏破它，果汁从指缝间滴下。莫尔蒙每天都喝掺柠檬的啤酒，宣称这是他依旧一口好牙的原因。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6618');"><p>"Doubtless you loved your father," Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn. "The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember when I told you that?"

If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole’s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6632" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我希望你也别怕继续活下去。”莫尔蒙边说边用匕首切开火腿，还拿一小块喂乌鸦。“你不算逃兵——因为你没走成。眼下你不就好端端站在这里?要是我把每个半夜溜到鼹鼠村的孩子都抓来砍头，那防守长城的就只剩鬼魂了。不过呢，或许你打算明天再跑，或许再隔两个星期。是不是?小子，你有没有这样想?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6633');"><p>Jon kept silent.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6634');"><p>"I thought so." Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg. "Your father is dead, lad. Do you think you can bring him back?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6634" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我就知道。”莫尔蒙剥开白煮蛋的壳，“小子，你父亲死了，你有办法让他起死回生吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6635');"><p>"No," he answered, sullen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6635" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有。”他闷闷不乐地回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6636');"><p>"Good," Mormont said. "We’ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and it’s not something I care to see again." He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth. "Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him. Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you’ll find in all the Night’s Watch. Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you such a mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6636" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那敢情好。”莫尔蒙道，“你我都见识过死人复活是什么样，我可不想再碰上那种事。”他两大口吞下煮蛋，从齿缝间吐出几片蛋壳。“你的兄弟虽然上了战场，但他身后有全北境的军力，随便他哪一个封臣手下的士兵都比整个守夜人军团的人加起来还多，你觉得他们会需要你的帮助?难道说你真那么厉害，还是说你随身带着古灵精怪，帮你的剑附加魔法?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6637');"><p>Jon had no answer for him. The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell. Pushing his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6637" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩无话可说。乌鸦啄着一颗蛋，穿破蛋壳，将长长的喙伸进去，拉出丝丝蛋白和蛋黄。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6638');"><p>The Old Bear sighed. "You are not the only one touched by this war. Like as not, my sister is marching in your brother’s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in men’s mail. Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful. Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters." Frowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched. "Or perhaps it does. Be that as it may, I’d still grieve if she were slain, yet you don’t see me running off. I said the words, just as you did. My place is here?.?.?.?where is yours, boy?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6638" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>熊老叹道：“你也不是惟一被战争波及的人。依我看，我妹妹此刻也应该带着她那群女儿，穿着男人的盔甲，加入你兄弟的军队去了南方。梅格是个上了年纪的老怪物，个性固执，脾气又差，说实话，我根本受不了那糟女人，但这并不代表我对她的感情不如你爱你的异母妹妹。”莫尔蒙皱着眉头拾起最后一颗蛋，用力握住，直到外壳碎裂。“或许不如你。但总之，她若在战场上被杀，我一定很难过，可你瞧，我并没打算逃跑。因为我和你一样都发过誓，我的职责所在是这里……你呢，孩子?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6639');"><p>I have no place, Jon wanted to say, I’m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now not even a father. The words would not come. "I don’t know."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6640');"><p>"I do," said Lord Commander Mormont. "The cold winds are rising, Snow. Beyond the Wall, the shadows lengthen. Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk, streaming south and east toward the sea, and mammoths as well. He says one of his men discovered huge, misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch. Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn. Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new, secret stronghold he’s found, to what end the gods only know. Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we’ve lost this past year?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6640" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可我知道，”莫尔蒙总司令说，“雪诺，冷风正要吹起，长城之外，阴影日长。卡特•派克的来信中提到大群麇鹿向东南沿海迁徙，之外还有长毛象。他还说，他有个部下在距离东海望仅三里格的地方发现了巨大的畸形脚印。影子塔的游骑兵则回报，长城外有好些村落完全被遗弃，到了晚上，丹尼斯爵士说能看到群山中的火光，大把大把的烈焰，从黄昏直烧到天亮。‘断掌’科林在大峡谷抓到了一个野人，对方发誓说曼斯•雷德正躲在一个新的秘密要塞里，召集属下所有臣民，至于他的目的为何，我看只有天上诸神知道。你以为你叔叔班扬是这几年来我们惟一失去的游骑兵么?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6641');"><p>"Ben Jen," the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak. "Ben Jen. Ben Jen."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6645');"><p>"It’s not," Mormont told him. "Gods save us, boy, you’re not blind and you’re not stupid. When dead men come hunting in the night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6645" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我看不然。”莫尔蒙告诉他，“诸神保佑，孩子，你眼睛没瞎，人也不笨。等哪天死人在黑夜里大举入侵，你觉得谁坐在铁王座上还有差别么?”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6649');"><p>"All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks. The First Men built the Wall, and it’s said they remember things otherwise forgotten. And that beast of yours?.?.?.?he led us to the wights, warned you of the dead man on the steps. Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I’m not." Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger. "I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall."

He pointed his dagger at Jon’s chest. "By custom, the Lord Commander’s steward is his squire as well?.?.?.?but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you’ve run off again. So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have it now. Are you a brother of the Night’s Watch?.?.?.?or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?"
