</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_205');"><p>Catelyn had never liked this godswood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_205" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳向来不喜欢这座神木林。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_206');"><p>She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident. The godswood there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_206" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>出身南境徒利家族的她，自小在红叉河畔的奔流城长大。红叉河是三叉戟河的支流，那里的神木林是座明亮清朗的花园，高大的红木树影洒进沟磷溪涧，鸟儿在栖隐巢穴里高唱，空气中弥漫百花馨香。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_207');"><p>The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no names.
</p></origin><translate id="div_207" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>临冬城信仰的神只则是另一番气象。这是个阴暗原始的地方，昏暝古堡巍然独立其间，万年古木样亘周边三英亩，散发出湿意和腐败的气味。此地不生红木，树林由披戴着灰绿松针的哨兵树、壮实的橡树，以及与王国同样苍老的铁树所组成。在这里粗壮厚实的黑色树干相互攘挤，扭曲的枝桠在头顶织就一片浓密的参天树顶，变形的错节盘根则在地底彼此角力。这是个属于深沉寂静和窒郁暗影的地方，而蛰居其间的神只连名字也付之阙如。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_208');"><p>But she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man’s life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_208" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但她知道今晚可以在这里找到丈夫。每回他取人性命后，总会来此觅求神木林的宁静。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_209');"><p>Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept.
</p></origin><translate id="div_209" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳身受七种圣油祝福与加持，连命名仪式也是在浸沐于七彩虹光的奔流城圣堂里举行的。她和父祖数代一样信仰七神（注解１），她信奉的神有名有姓，脸庞也如同自己双亲般熟悉。她在香炉冉冉的圣堂里祷告，燃香气味飘漫，有着光芒共生的七面水晶，和喃喃的人声吟唱。徒利家族虽然像其他大家贵族般拥有自己的神木林，但只不过是个散步阅读或在暖阳下休憩的处所，敬拜神明向来是圣堂里的事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_210');"><p>For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest.
</p></origin><translate id="div_210" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德（注解２）为她建了座小圣堂，好让她有个向七神诵唱的地方。然而史塔克家族体内依旧流淌着“先民”的血液，他信奉没有名号也没有容貌的远古诸神，那些属于苍翠树林，曾经与消失的森林之子共同信仰的神。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_211');"><p>At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold. "The heart tree," Ned called it. The weirwood’s bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those eyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were true; they had watched the castle’s granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men across the narrow sea.
</p></origin><translate id="div_211" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>林子中央有棵古老的鱼梁木，笼罩着一泓黑冷池水，奈德称之为“城心树”。鱼梁木的树皮灰白如骨，叶色深红，有如千只染血手掌。树干上刻了一张人脸，容貌深长而忧郁，满是干涸红色树汁的深陷眼凹怪异地充满警戒意味。那是一双古老的眼睛，比临冬城还要古老，它们曾经目睹“筑城者”布兰登安下第一块基石，倘若传说属实，它们也见证了城堡的大理石墙在四周逐渐高筑。传说这些脸是森林之子在“先民”渡过狭海而来之前刻上去的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_212');"><p>In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_212" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>南方的鱼梁木早在千年前便遭砍伐焚烧殆尽，只有千面屿上还有绿人静静地看守。然而在北境一切都回然不同，这里每一座城堡都有自己的神木林，每座神木林都有一棵城心树，每棵城心树都有一张人脸。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_213');"><p>Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came. "Ned," she called softly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_213" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳在鱼梁木下找到了她的丈夫，他正静坐在苔藓爬盖的磐石上。宝剑“寒冰”斜躺于膝，而他正用那漆黑如永夜的池水清洗剑上的血污。千年累积的腐植臼厚厚地覆盖在神树林的土地上，吸走了她的足音，但鱼梁木的那双红眼却彷佛紧跟着她不放。“奈德。”她轻声唤道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_214');"><p>He lifted his head to look at her. "Catelyn," he said. His voice was distant and formal. "Where are the children?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_214" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他抬起头望着她。“凯特琳，”他的语调遥远而庄重。“孩子们呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_215');"><p>He would always ask her that. "In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups." She spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes watching her, but she did her best to ignore them. "Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and gracious, but Rickon is not quite sure."
</p></origin><translate id="div_215" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他总是会问起这句。“在厨房里为了要帮小狼们取些什么名字而正在吵架呢！”她把披风铺在林地上，然后在池边坐下，背靠着鱼梁木。她感觉得到那双眼睛盯着自己看，但她竭尽所能想忽略它。“艾莉亚已经爱得发狂了，珊莎也很喜欢，瑞肯则还不太确定。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_216');"><p>"Is he afraid?" Ned asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_216" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他害怕么？”奈德问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_217');"><p>"A little," she admitted. "He is only three."
</p></origin><translate id="div_217" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有一点，”她承认道，“毕竟他才三岁。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_218');"><p>Ned frowned. "He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is coming."
</p></origin><translate id="div_218" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德皱眉，“他得学着面对自己的恐惧，他不可能永远都是三岁，更何况凛冬将至。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_219');"><p>"Yes," Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The Stark words. Every noble house had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory, promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark words. Not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were.
</p></origin><translate id="div_219" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是啊，”凯特琳也同意，最后那句话一如往常地教她不寒而栗。那是史塔克家族的警语，每一个贵族家族都有自己的箴言警句：或是世代相传的座右铭，或是待人处事的衡量辬准，或是面临困境的祷词；有的夸耀荣誉，有些讲究忠贞诚信，还有的为信仰勇气宣誓，唯独史塔克家族例外。凛冬将至，史塔克家族的警语是这么说的。她已经不只一次在心里暗自疑惑，这些北方人究竟是什么样的一群怪人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_220');"><p>"The man died well, I’ll give him that," Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. "I was glad for Bran’s sake. You would have been proud of Bran."
</p></origin><translate id="div_220" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“今天那个人死得很干脆，这一点我不否认。”奈德说道，他手里握了一块上了油的皮革，边说边轻拭剑身，把金属磨出一道暗沉的光泽。“我很为布兰高兴，你要是在场，也会为他骄傲的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_221');"><p>"I am always proud of Bran," Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been forged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was forged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in the North.
</p></origin><translate id="div_221" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我向来都很为他骄傲。”凯特琳看着他拭剑答道，她可以看见钢铁深处的波纹，那是锻臸时千锤百链的印记。凯特琳对刀剑素无好感，但她不能否认“寒冰”确实有其独特的美。它是在末日浩劫降临古自由堡垒以前，在瓦雷利亚锻造而成的，当时的铁匠不仅用凿槌冶铁，也用法术来形塑金属。宝剑已有四百年历史，却仍旧如同它锻冶初成时那般锋利，它的名字则更是源远流长，是古代英雄纪元时的精神遗产，那时史塔克一族是北境之王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_222');"><p>"He was the fourth this year," Ned said grimly. "The poor man was half-mad. Something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him." He sighed. "Ben writes that the strength of the Night’s Watch is down below a thousand. It’s not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as well."
</p></origin><translate id="div_222" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这已经是今年第四个逃兵了，”奈德沉着脸说道，“那个可怜的家伙已经疯了一半，不知什么东西把他吓成那副德行，连我说话都起不了作用。”他叹口气，“班扬写信来说守夜人的兵力只剩不到一千，不只是因为逃兵，他们派出去的巡逻队也损失惨重。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_223');"><p>"Is it the wildlings?" she asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_223" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是野人的关系么？”她问道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_224');"><p>"Who else?" Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. "And it will only grow worse. The day may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all."
</p></origin><translate id="div_224" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还会有谁呢？”奈德举起“寒冰”，俯首审视手中冰冷的钢铁。“而且恐怕情况只会越来越糟，也许我更会别无选择，非得召集家臣，率军北进，与这个绝境长城以外的国王一决生死。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_225');"><p>"Beyond the Wall?" The thought made Catelyn shudder.
</p></origin><translate id="div_225" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“绝境长城以外？”凯特琳想到就不禁浑身颤抖。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_226');"><p>Ned saw the dread on her face. "Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear."
</p></origin><translate id="div_226" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德察觉了她脸上的恐惧。“我们用不着害怕曼斯•雷德。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_227');"><p>"There are darker things beyond the Wall." She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts.
</p></origin><translate id="div_227" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“长城外还有更可怕的东西。”她转过头去，看着城心树惨白的树皮和赭红的双眼，凝视、倾听、思考着深邃悠远的思绪。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_228');"><p>His smile was gentle. "You listen to too many of Old Nan’s stories. The Others are as dead as the children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No living man has ever seen one."
</p></origin><translate id="div_228" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的微笑好温柔。“你听了太多老奶妈的故事了。异鬼和森林之子一样，早已经消失了八千多年。鲁温师傅会告诉你他们根本就没存在过，没有人活着见过他们。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_229');"><p>"Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either," Catelyn reminded him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_229" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在今天早上以前，不也没有人见过冰原狼么？”凯特琳提醒他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_230');"><p>"I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully," he said with a rueful smile. He slid Ice back into its sheath. "You did not come here to tell me crib tales. I know how little you like this place. What is it, my lady?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_230" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我怎么样也说不过徒利家族的人，”他嘴角浮起一抹后悔的微笑，将“寒冰”收回剑鞘。 “我猜你不是跑来跟我讲睡前故事的，更何况我知道你一点也不喜欢这个地方。 究竟是什么事，我的好夫人？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_231');"><p>Catelyn took her husband’s hand. "There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself." There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight. "I am so sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead."
</p></origin><translate id="div_231" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳握住丈夫的手。“今天我们接获了悲伤的消息，夫君，我不想在你清理宝剑之前打扰你。”既然没有办法减轻伤害，她决定实话实说。“亲爱的，我很难过，琼恩•艾林过世了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_232');"><p>His eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had demanded their heads, the Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect.
</p></origin><translate id="div_232" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们视线相对，她可以清楚地看见他受的打击有多大，正如她所预料。奈德年轻时曾在鹰巢城做过养子，而膝下无子的艾林公爵待他和另一名养子劳勃•拜拉席恩有如生父再世。当疯王伊里斯•坦格利安二世要求他交出两人的项上人头时，这位鹰巢城主揭起他的新月猎鹰旗，宁可兴兵革命也不愿交出他誓言守护的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_233');"><p>And one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and Ned stood together in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully.
</p></origin><translate id="div_233" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>而就在十五年前的那一天，这位再世生父又成了奈德的运襟。他们并肩站在奔流城的圣殿里，娶了一对姊妹，也就是霍斯特•徒利公爵的两个女儿。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_234');"><p>"Jon?.?.?.?" he said. "Is this news certain?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_234" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“琼恩……”他说道，“这消息确定了么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_235');"><p>"It was the king’s seal, and the letter is in Robert’s own hand. I saved it for you. He said Lord Arryn was taken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain."
</p></origin><translate id="div_235" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“信上是国王的印鉴，而且是劳勃亲自手书的。他说艾林公爵走得很仓促，就连派席尔国师也束手无策。不过国师给他喝了罂粟花奶，所以琼恩并没有受太多折磨。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_236');"><p>"That is some small mercy, I suppose," he said. She could see the grief on his face, but even then he thought first of her. "Your sister," he said. "And Jon’s boy. What word of them?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_236" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想这也算是最后的一点慈悲了。”他说道，她看见了他脸上的悲伤，但他先想到的还是她。“你妹妹，”他问道，“还有琼恩的儿子，有他们的消息么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_237');"><p>"The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie," Catelyn said. "I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husband’s place, not hers. Lord Jon’s memory will haunt each stone. I know my sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends around her."
</p></origin><translate id="div_237" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“信上只说他们安然无恙，而且已经返回鹰巢城了。”凯特琳说道，“我真希望他们回的是奔流城。鹰巢城高耸孤绝，而且一直都是她丈夫的地盘，而非她的归宿。琼恩大人的回忆肯定会萦绕鹰巢城里的每一块砖石。我很了解妹妹，她需要的是家人和朋友的支持和陪伴。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_238');"><p>"Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, I’d heard."
</p></origin><translate id="div_238" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你的叔叔不是正在艾林谷等着她么？我听说琼恩任命他做了血门骑士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_239');"><p>Catelyn nodded. "Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That is some comfort, but still?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_239" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳点点头，“布林登当然会尽他所能照顾她和她儿子，可是……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_240');"><p>"Go to her," Ned urged. "Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter. That boy of hers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief."
</p></origin><translate id="div_240" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么你去陪她罢，”奈德劝促道，“把孩子也一起带去，让她的居所充满欢笑和喧闹。那孩子需要其他同侪的陪伴，你妹妹更不应独自哀悼。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_241');"><p>"Would that I could," Catelyn said. "The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out."
</p></origin><translate id="div_241" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果我能去就好了。”凯特琳说道，“信上还说到别的事，国王正在往临冬城的路上，他要找你共商国事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_242');"><p>It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. "Robert is coming here?" When she nodded, a smile broke across his face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_242" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德好一会才理解她话中的意思，但是当他恍然大悟时，眼中阴霾顿时一扫而空。“劳勃要来？”她点点头，他脸上随即绽开一抹微笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_243');"><p>Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. "I knew that would please you," she said. "We should send word to your brother on the Wall."
</p></origin><translate id="div_243" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳真希望自己能分享他的喜悦，但是她在庭院里听到了传闻，有只冰原狼死在雪地里，喉咙里有根断裂的鹿角。恐惧如同毒蛇般在她心里蜷曲，但她迫使自己在这个她深爱的男人面前强颜欢笑，这个不相信任何预兆的男人。“我就知道你听了会高兴，” 她说道：“我们应该通知你在长城的弟弟。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_244');"><p>"Yes, of course," he agreed. "Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest bird." Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. "Damnation, how many years has it been? And he gives us no more notice than this? How many in his party, did the message say?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_244" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对，当然要，”他同意，“班一定会想来。我请鲁温师傅派他飞最快的鸟儿送信去。”奈德直起身，也拉她起来。“该死，我们有多少年没见面了？他居然没有另外通知我。信上有没有写一共会有多少人来？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_245');"><p>"I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders. Cersei and the children travel with them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_245" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想至少有一百位骑士吧，加上他们的随从，还有一倍半人数的流浪武土。瑟曦和她的孩子们也都来了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_246');"><p>"Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes," he said. "It is just as well. That will give us more time to prepare."
</p></origin><translate id="div_246" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么为了他们着想，劳勃不会走太快的。”他说，“也好，这样一来我们才有多点时间准备。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_247');"><p>"The queen’s brothers are also in the party," she told him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_247" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“皇后的哥哥也在队伍里。”她告诉他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_248');"><p>Ned grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen’s family, Catelyn knew. The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert’s cause, when victory was all but certain, and he had never forgiven them. "Well, if the price for Robert’s company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. It sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court."
</p></origin><translate id="div_248" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德听后脸色立刻一沉。凯特琳很清楚他和皇后的家族间向来互无好感，凯岩城的兰尼斯特家族当年是最晚加入劳勃势力的贵族，等到胜败情势早已明朗化后才表态，而奈德始终没有原谅他们。“也罢！如果劳勃来访的代价是这些兰尼斯特家族的讨厌鬼，那就认了吧。只是，听起来劳勃好像把他半个宫廷的人都带来了。“
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_249');"><p>"Where the king goes, the realm follows," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_249" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“国王走到哪儿，王国就跟到哪儿嘛！”她答道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_250');"><p>"It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman’s teat the last time I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_250" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“看看那些孩子倒也不错。上次见面的时候，劳勃最小的儿子还在喝那个兰尼斯特女人的奶水。一转眼都几年了？他现在应该已经……，五岁了吧？”
