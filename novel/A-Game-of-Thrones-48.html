</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4262');"><p>He was walking through the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he he had walked a thousand times before. The Kings of Winter watched him pass with eyes of ice, and the direwolves at their feet turned their great stone heads and snarled. Last of all, he came to the tomb where his father slept, with Brandon and Lyanna beside him. "Promise me, Ned," Lyanna’s statue whispered. She wore a garland of pale blue roses, and her eyes wept blood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4262" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他穿过临冬城底的墓窖，如同之前几千次一样。凛冬国度的王者用冰冷的眼光看着他经过，脚边的冰原狼扭过石砌的狼头向他嘶吼。最后，他来到父亲长眠之处，在他身旁是布兰登和莱安娜。“奈德，答应我。”莱安娜的雕像轻声说。她头戴碧蓝玫瑰织成的花环，双眼泣血。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4263');"><p>Eddard Stark jerked upright, his heart racing, the blankets tangled around him. The room was black as pitch, and someone was hammering on the door. "Lord Eddard," a voice called loudly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4263" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾德•史塔克惊坐而起，心脏狂跳，毛毯纠结。房间漆黑一片，敲门声大作。“艾德大人。”有人高叫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4264');"><p>"A moment." Groggy and naked, he stumbled his way across the darkened chamber. When he opened the door, he found Tomard with an upraised fist, and Cayn with a taper in hand. Between them stood the king’s own steward.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4264" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“等一等。”他身子虚弱，躯体赤裸，跌跌撞撞穿过黑暗的房间。打开门，他看到正举拳敲门的托马德，以及手握烛台的凯恩。两人之间是国王的御前总管。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4265');"><p>The man’s face might have been carved of stone, so little did it show. "My lord Hand," he intoned. "His Grace the King commands your presence. At once."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4265" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那人面无表情，几乎像是石雕。“首相大人，”他语气平板地说，“国王陛下宣您立刻觐见。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4266');"><p>So Robert had returned from his hunt. It was long past time. "I shall need a few moments to dress." Ned left the man waiting without. Cayn helped him with his clothes; white linen tunic and grey cloak, trousers cut open down his plaster-sheathed leg, his badge of office, and last of all a belt of heavy silver links. He sheathed the Valyrian dagger at his waist.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4266" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这么说劳勃已经打猎归来，也早该是时候了。“给我几分钟换衣服。”奈德让总管等在门外。凯恩服侍他更衣，他穿上白色亚麻布外衣和灰色披风，裤子已经裁短，方便打上石膏的断腿。他扣上首相徽章，以及一条沉重的银链腰带，最后将那把瓦雷利亚匕首系在腰间。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4267');"><p>The Red Keep was dark and still as Cayn and Tomard escorted him across the inner bailey. The moon hung low over the walls, ripening toward full. On the ramparts, a guardsman in a gold cloak walked his rounds.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4267" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>红堡黑暗而寂静。当凯恩和托马德护送他穿过内城时，由缺转圆的月亮已经低悬高墙。壁垒上，一名金色披风的守卫正来回巡视。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4268');"><p>The royal apartments were in Maegor’s Holdfast, a massive square fortress that nestled in the heart of the Red Keep behind walls twelve feet thick and a dry moat lined with iron spikes, a castle-within-a-castle. Ser Boros Blount guarded the far end of the bridge, white steel armor ghostly in the moonlight. Within, Ned passed two other knights of the Kingsguard; Ser Preston Greenfield stood at the bottom of the steps, and Ser Barristan Selmy waited at the door of the king’s bedchamber. Three men in white cloaks, he thought, remembering, and a strange chill went through him. Ser Barristan’s face was as pale as his armor. Ned had only to look at him to know that something was dreadfully wrong. The royal steward opened the door. "Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King," he announced.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4268" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王家居室位于梅葛楼，那是一座巨大的方形要塞，深藏在红堡的中心地带，由十二尺厚的围墙以及干涸但插满尖刺的护城河团团包围。这是座城中之城。柏洛斯•布劳恩爵士把守在吊桥彼端，白色精钢铠甲在月光下寒气森森。进楼之后，奈德又经过两名御林铁卫，普列斯顿•格林菲尔爵士站在楼梯口，巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士守在国王寝室门外。三个雪白披风的骑士，他忆起过去，一阵诡异的寒意袭上心头。巴利斯坦爵士的脸和他的盔甲一样苍白。奈德只需看他一眼，便知大事不妙。王家总管打开门，“艾德•史塔克公爵大人，国王之手。”他高声宣布。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4269');"><p>"Bring him here," Robert’s voice called, strangely thick.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4269" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“带他进来。”劳勃喊道，声音出奇地混浊。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4270');"><p>Fires blazed in the twin hearths at either end of the bedchamber, filling the room with a sullen red glare. The heat within was suffocating. Robert lay across the canopied bed. At the bedside hovered Grand Maester Pycelle, while Lord Renly paced restlessly before the shuttered windows. Servants moved back and forth, feeding logs to the fire and boiling wine. Cersei Lannister sat on the edge of the bed beside her husband. Her hair was tousled, as if from sleep, but there was nothing sleepy in her eyes. They followed Ned as Tomard and Cayn helped him cross the room. He seemed to move very slowly, as if he were still dreaming.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4270" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卧室两端对称位置的壁炉里火烧得炽热，让房间充满一种阴沉的红色亮光。屋内的热度高得令人窒息，劳勃躺在挂着幔帐的床上，派席尔国师随侍在旁，蓝礼公爵则焦躁地在紧闭的窗前踱步。仆人来来去去，或增添柴火，或煮热葡萄酒。瑟曦•兰尼斯特坐在床边，靠近她的丈夫。她头发散乱，似乎刚从睡梦中醒来，但那双眼中却毫无睡意。托马德和凯恩扶着奈德穿过房间时，那双眼睛便直直地盯着他看。他移动的速度非常缓慢，仿佛置身梦境。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4271');"><p>The king still wore his boots. Ned could see dried mud and blades of grass clinging to the leather where Robert’s feet stuck out beneath the blanket that covered him, A green doublet lay on the floor, slashed open and discarded, the cloth crusted with red-brown stains. The room smelled of smoke and blood and death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4271" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃双脚伸在毛毯外，还套着靴子，奈德看见皮革上沾满泥土和干草。一件绿色外衣扔在地上，上面有割开后弃置的痕迹，以及褐红的污垢。房间弥漫着烟尘与血腥，还有死亡的气息。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4272');"><p>"Ned," the king whispered when he saw him. His face was pale as milk. "Come?.?.?.?closer."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4272" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“奈德，”国王看见他的脸，便小声说。他的脸色苍白一如牛奶。“靠……近一点。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4273');"><p>His men brought him close. Ned steadied himself with a hand on the bedpost. He had only to look down at Robert to know how bad it was. "What?.?.?.??" he began, his throat clenched.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4273" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德的侍卫扶他上前。他一手撑着床柱，稳住身子。他只需低头看劳勃一眼，便知伤势有多严重。“是什么……？”他开口欲问，喉咙却仿佛被钳子夹住。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4274');"><p>"A boar." Lord Renly was still in his hunting greens, his cloak spattered with blood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4274" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是一只野猪。”蓝礼公爵仍穿着绿色猎装，斗篷上全是血。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4275');"><p>"A devil," the king husked. "My own fault. Too much wine, damn me to hell. Missed my thrust."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4275" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一头该死的恶魔。”国王嘶声道，“我自己失误。酒喝多了，结果没舐中，我活该下地狱。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4276');"><p>"And where were the rest of you?" Ned demanded of Lord Renly. "Where was Ser Barristan and the Kingsguard?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4276" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们都在干什么？”奈德臼问蓝礼公爵，“巴利斯坦爵士和御林铁卫都跑哪儿去了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4277');"><p>Renly’s mouth twitched. "My brother commanded us to stand aside and let him take the boar alone."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4277" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>蓝礼撇撇嘴。“我哥哥他命令我们站一边儿去，好让他单独对付那只野猪。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4278');"><p>Eddard Stark lifted the blanket.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4278" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾德•史塔克揭开毛毯。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4279');"><p>They had done what they could to close him up, but it was nowhere near enough. The boar must have been a fearsome thing. It had ripped the king from groin to nipple with its tusks. The wine-soaked bandages that Grand Maester Pycelle had applied were already black with blood, and the smell off the wound was hideous. Ned’s stomach turned. He let the blanket fall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4279" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们已经竭尽所能为他缝合，但效果依旧不明显。那野猪一定是头可怕的家伙，它用两根长牙把国王从下体一直撕裂到胸部。派席尔国师用来包扎的浸酒纱布已经染满鲜血，散发的气味更是骇人。奈德的胃一阵翻搅。他松开毛毯。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4280');"><p>"Stinks," Robert said. "The stink of death, don’t think I can’t smell it. Bastard did me good, eh? But I?.?.?.?I paid him back in kind, Ned." The king’s smile was as terrible as his wound, his teeth red. "Drove a knife right through his eye. Ask them if I didn’t. Ask them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4280" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“臭死了，”劳勃道，“这就是死亡的臭气，别以为我闻不出来。这回我可被整惨了，对吧？不过我……我也没让它好过，奈德。”国王的笑容与伤口同样惊人，他的牙齿一片血红。“我一刀捅烂了它眼睛。你问问他们是不是真的……问哪！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4281');"><p>"Truly," Lord Renly murmured. "We brought the carcass back with us, at my brother’s command."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4281" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，”蓝礼公爵喃喃道，“照我哥哥的吩咐，我们把尸体带了回来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4282');"><p>"For the feast," Robert whispered. "Now leave us. The lot of you. I need to speak with Ned."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4282" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“带回来准备晚宴。”劳勃轻声说，“让我们独处一下。你们都退下，我要跟奈德谈谈。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4283');"><p>"Robert, my sweet lord?.?.?.?" Cersei began.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4283" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃，亲爱的……”瑟曦开口。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4284');"><p>"I said leave," Robert insisted with a hint of his old fierceness. "What part of that don’t you understand, woman?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4284" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我说过了，给我退下。”劳勃的坚持里有几分他昔日的刚毅。“你是哪个字听不懂啊，臭女人？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4285');"><p>Cersei gathered up her skirts and her dignity and led the way to the door. Lord Renly and the others followed. Grand Maester Pycelle lingered, his hands shaking as he offered the king a cup of thick white liquid. "The milk of the poppy, Your Grace," he said. "Drink. For your pain."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4285" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>瑟曦拢起她的裙子和自尊，领头走向房门。蓝礼公爵和其他人跟在后面。派席尔大学士留了下来，双手颤抖着把一杯浓浊的白色液体递给国王。“陛下，这是罂粟花奶，”他说，“请喝下去，给您止痛。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4286');"><p>Robert knocked the cup away with the back of his hand. "Away with you. I’ll sleep soon enough, old fool. Get out."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4286" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃用手背挥开杯子。“快滚，老不死，我再过不久就要一睡不醒了。滚出去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4287');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle gave Ned a stricken look as he shuffled from the room.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4287" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔国师给了奈德一个受伤的眼神，拖着脚离开了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4288');"><p>"Damn you, Robert," Ned said when they were alone. His leg was throbbing so badly he was almost blind with pain. Or perhaps it was grief that fogged his eyes. He lowered himself to the bed, beside his friend. "Why do you always have to be so headstrong?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4288" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃，你该死的，”只剩他们两人后，奈德开口说。他的腿痛得让他几乎睁不开眼。也或许是悲痛模糊了他的视线。他坐到床边，坐在他的朋友身旁。“你非得这么鲁莽不可？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4289');"><p>"Ah, fuck you, Ned," the king said hoarsely. "I killed the bastard, didn’t I?" A lock of matted black hair fell across his eyes as he glared up at Ned. "Ought to do the same for you. Can’t leave a man to hunt in peace. Ser Robar found me. Gregor’s head. Ugly thought. Never told the Hound. Let Cersei surprise him." His laugh turned into a grunt as a spasm of pain hit him. "Gods have mercy," he muttered, swallowing his agony. "The girl. Daenerys. Only a child, you were right?.?.?.?that’s why, the girl?.?.?.?the gods sent the boar?.?.?.?sent to punish me . . ." The king coughed, bringing up blood. "Wrong, it was wrong, I?.?.?.?only a girl?.?.?.?Varys, Littlefinger, even my brother?.?.?.?worthless?.?.?.?no one to tell me no but you, Ned . . . only you?.?.?.?" He lifted his hand, the gesture pained and feeble. "Paper and ink. There, on the table. Write what I tell you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4289" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，操你，奈德，”国王粗声道，“我好歹宰了那王八蛋，对不？”一撮蒙尘的黑发落下来遮住他的眼，他抬头瞪着奈德。“我该把你也宰了才对，连打猎都不肯让人安安静静地打。罗拔爵士找到我啦。说什么要砍格雷果的头。想来就不舒服。我没对猎狗讲。让瑟曦去吓吓他罢。”他笑到一半，突然一阵剧痛袭身，便转为闷哼。“诸神慈悲，”他喃喃念道，疼痛地喘气。“那女孩。丹妮莉丝。她只是个孩子，你说得没错……这就是为什么，那女孩……天上诸神派这头野猪……派来惩罚我……”国王咳出一滩鲜血。“错了，我做错了，我……她只是个女孩……瓦里斯，小指头，连我弟弟……废物……奈德，除了你之外，没有人敢对我说一个不……只有你……”他在极度疼痛的状态下，虚弱地举起手。“拿纸笔来。就在那边桌上。把我说的写下来。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4290');"><p>Ned smoothed the paper out across his knee and took up the quill. "At your command, Your Grace."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4290" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德把纸摊平在膝盖上，拿起羽毛笔。“陛下，请您指示。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4291');"><p>"This is the will and word of Robert of House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and all the rest, put in the damn titles, you know how it goes. I do hereby command Eddard of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King, to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my?.?.?.?upon my death?.?.?.?to rule in my?.?.?.?in my stead, until my son Joffrey does come of age?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4291" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“以下为拜拉席恩家族的劳勃一世，安达尔人和其他人的——把他妈的那些鬼头衔通通放进去，你知道是哪些——的遗嘱。余在此任命临冬城公爵，国王之手，史塔克家族的艾德为舏政王及全境守护者……自余死后……代余……代余统理国事……俟吾儿乔佛里成年……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4292');"><p>"Robert?.?.?.?" Joffrey is not your son, he wanted to say, but the words would not come. The agony was written too plainly across Robert’s face; he could not hurt him more. So Ned bent his head and wrote, but where the king had said "my son Joffrey," he scrawled "my heir" instead. The deceit made him feel soiled. The lies we tell for love, he thought. May the gods forgive me. "What else would you have me say?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4292" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃……”乔佛里不是你儿子，他想说，却说不出口。劳勃所承受的痛苦清楚明白地写在脸上，他不忍心将更多痛苦加诸于他。于是奈德低头振笔疾书，只将“吾儿乔佛里”改为“吾之合法继承人”。欺瞒让他觉得自己人格污损。这是我们为爱而撒的谎，他心想，愿天上诸神原谅我。“您还要我写什么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4293');"><p>"Say?.?.?.?whatever you need to. Protect and defend, gods old and new, you have the words. Write. I’ll sign it. You give it to the council when I’m dead."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4293" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“写……该写什么就写什么。遵守，保护，新旧诸神，你知道这些罗嗦词语。写完我来签名。等我死了把这个交给御前会议。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4294');"><p>"Robert," Ned said in a voice thick with grief, "you must not do this. Don’t die on me. The realm needs you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4294" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃，”奈德的语气充满悲伤，“不要这样，不要离开我。国家需要你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4295');"><p>Robert took his hand, fingers squeezing hard. "You are?.?.?.?such a bad liar, Ned Stark," he said through his pain. "The realm?.?.?.?the realm knows?.?.?.?what a wretched king I’ve been. Bad as Aerys, the gods spare me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4295" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃紧握住他的手，用力挤压。“奈德•史塔克，你……真不会说谎。”他忍痛说，“这国家……这国家很清楚……我是怎样的一个昏君，跟伊里斯一样的昏君。诸神饶恕我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4296');"><p>"No," Ned told his dying friend, "not so bad as Aerys, Your Grace. Not near so bad as Aerys."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4296" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，”奈德告诉他垂死的老友，“陛下，您和伊里斯不一样。您比他好得太多。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4297');"><p>Robert managed a weak red smile. "At the least, they will say?.?.?.?this last thing?.?.?.?this I did right. You won’t fail me. You’ll rule now. You’ll hate it, worse than I did?.?.?.?but you’ll do well. Are you done with the scribbling?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4297" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃勉强挤出一丝微笑，嘴角还带着血迹。“至少，人们会说……我这辈子所做的最后一件事……没有错。你不会让我失望的。这国家就交给你了。你会比我更讨厌治理……但你会做得很好。你写好了么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4298');"><p>"Yes, Your Grace." Ned offered Robert the paper. The king scrawled his signature blindly, leaving a smear of blood across the letter. "The seal should be witnessed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4298" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好了，陛下。”奈德把纸递给国王。国王胡乱签了个名，在字里行间留下一滩血迹。“封印时需有人见证。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4299');"><p>"Serve the boar at my funeral feast," Robert rasped. "Apple in its mouth, skin seared crisp. Eat the bastard. Don’t care if you choke on him. Promise me, Ned."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4299" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“记得把那只野猪当我葬礼的主菜，”劳勃嘶声道，“嘴里塞个苹果，皮烤得香香脆脆，把那王八蛋给吃啰。我管你会不会撑死。答应我，奈德。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4300');"><p>"I promise." Promise me, Ned, Lyanna’s voice echoed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4300" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我答应你。”奈德说。答应我，奈德，莱安娜在应和。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4301');"><p>"The girl," the king said. "Daenerys. Let her live.

</p></origin><translate id="div_4301" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那女孩，”国王说，“丹妮莉丝，让她活命吧。如果你有法子，如果……还来得及……命令他们……瓦里斯，小指头……别让他们杀她。还有，帮帮我儿子，奈德。让他变成……比我更好的人。”他痛得皱眉，“诸神可怜我。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4302');"><p>"They will, my friend," Ned said. "They will."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4302" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们会的，我的朋友，”奈德说，“他们会的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4303');"><p>The king closed his eyes and seemed to relax. "Killed by a pig," he muttered. "Ought to laugh, but it hurts too much."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4303" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王闭起眼睛，似是稍觉放松。“到头来竟被野猪所杀，”他喃喃自语，“要不是这么痛，真该大笑一场。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4304');"><p>Ned was not laughing. "Shall I call them back?"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4305');"><p>Robert gave a weak nod. "As you will. Gods, why is it so cold in here?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4305" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃虚弱地点头。“也好。老天，这儿怎么冷成这副德行？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4306');"><p>The servants rushed back in and hurried to feed the fires. The queen had gone; that was some small relief, at least. If she had any sense, Cersei would take her children and fly before the break of day, Ned thought. She had lingered too long already.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4306" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>仆人们冲进来，赶忙为炉火添柴。王后已经走了，至少这算一点安慰。如果瑟曦还有点理臹，奈德心想，她应该带着孩子赶在黎明前逃走。她已经拖延太久。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4307');"><p>King Robert did not seem to miss her. He bid his brother Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle to stand in witness as he pressed his seal into the hot yellow wax that Ned had dripped upon his letter. "Now give me something for the pain and let me die."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4307" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃国王也并不想念她。他让弟弟蓝礼和派席尔国师作见证，然后拿起国玺，盖在奈德滴在纸上的热黄蜡泥上。“现在给我止痛的东西，让我去死罢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4308');"><p>Hurriedly Grand Maester Pycelle mixed him another draught of the milk of the poppy. This time the king drank deeply. His black beard was beaded with thick white droplets when he threw the empty cup aside. "Will I dream?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4308" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔国师匆忙调臸了另一帖罂粟花奶。这次国王喝了个干净，抛出杯子，他的黑胡须上沾满了浓稠的白色液滴。“我会做梦吗？”

</p></origin><translate id="div_4367" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“瓦里斯的暗示，”小指头说，“而您现在证实了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4368');"><p>Ned’s mouth twisted in anger. "Damn Varys and his little birds. Catelyn spoke truly, the man has some black art. I do not trust him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4368" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德的嘴因愤怒而扭曲：“去他的瓦里斯和他的小小鸟儿。凯特琳说得没错，这人懂妖法。我不信任他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4369');"><p>"Excellent. You’re learning." Littlefinger leaned forward. "Yet I’ll wager you did not drag me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4369" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“很好，你慢慢学乖了。”小指头向前靠，“可我敢打赌你大半夜把我拖来，不是来讨论太监的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4370');"><p>"No," Ned admitted. "I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect. Robert will leave no trueborn son behind him. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister’s bastards, born of his incestuous union with the queen."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4370" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不是，”奈德承认，“我知道了琼恩•艾林保守的秘密，他便是因此遭人灭口。劳勃死后没有亲生儿子可以继承王位。乔佛里和托曼是詹姆•兰尼斯特和王后乱伦产下的私生子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4371');"><p>Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow. "Shocking," he said in a tone that suggested he was not shocked at all. "The girl as well? No doubt. So when the king dies?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4371" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头扬起一道眉毛。“令人震惊。”然而他的语气显然完全不感惊讶。“女孩也是？想也知道。所以国王死后……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4372');"><p>"The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis, the elder of Robert’s two brothers."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4372" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“王位应传给史坦尼斯大人，劳勃最年长的弟弟。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4373');"><p>Lord Petyr stroked his pointed beard as he considered the matter. "So it would seem. Unless?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4373" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>培提尔伯爵捻着尖胡子，仔细思索这个问题。“看来是如此。除非……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4374');"><p>"Unless, my lord? There is no seeming to this. Stannis is the heir. Nothing can change that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4374" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，除非？这事没有任何疑问。史坦尼斯是王位继承人，没有什么可以改变这事实。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4375');"><p>"Stannis cannot take the throne without your help. If you’re wise, you’ll make certain Joffrey succeeds."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4375" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“缺了你的协助，史坦尼斯得不到王位。如果你够聪明，应该确保乔佛里登基为王。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4376');"><p>Ned gave him a stony stare. "Have you no shred of honor?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4376" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德狠狠地瞪了他一眼。“你一点荣誉心都没有吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4377');"><p>"Oh, a shred, surely," Littlefinger replied negligently. "Hear me out. Stannis is no friend of yours, nor of mine. Even his brothers can scarcely stomach him. The man is iron, hard and unyielding. He’ll give us a new Hand and a new council, for a certainty. No doubt he’ll thank you for handing him the crown, but he won’t love you for it. And his ascent will mean war. Stannis cannot rest easy on the throne until Cersei and her bastards are dead. Do you think Lord Tywin will sit idly while his daughter’s head is measured for a spike? Casterly Rock will rise, and not alone. Robert found it in him to pardon men who served King Aerys, so long as they did him fealty. Stannis is less forgiving. He will not have forgotten the siege of Storm’s End, and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dare not. Every man who fought beneath the dragon banner or rose with Balon Greyjoy will have good cause to fear. Seat Stannis on the Iron Throne and I promise you, the realm will bleed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4377" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎，有当然是有那么一点点啦。”小指头漫不经心地回答，“仔细听我说。史坦尼斯并非你我之友，连他兄弟两人都受不了他。这家伙是钢铁铸的，个性强硬、绝不妥协。想也知道，届时他会另立新的首相和御前会议。他当然会谢谢你把王冠交给他，但他不会因此而喜欢你。更何况他一旦登基，必定会引来战事。你想想，除非瑟曦和她的私生子通通死光，否则史坦尼斯的王位绝对坐不安稳。泰温大人会坐视他女儿的头给晾在枪上吗？凯岩城肯定会起兵，而他们绝非势单力薄。劳勃愿意舎免曾在伊里斯王手下做事的人，只要他们向他宣誓效忠。史坦尼斯可没这么好心肠。他永远不会忘记风息堡之围，提利尔大人和雷德温大人则是不敢忘记。只要曾经高举火龙旗臶，或与巴隆•葛雷乔伊一同兴兵作乱的人都会怕他。若是把史坦尼斯送上铁王座，我敢向你保证，王国会血流成河。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4378');"><p>"Now look at the other side of the coin. Joffrey is but twelve, and Robert gave you the regency, my lord. You are the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm. The power is yours, Lord Stark. All you need do is reach out and take it. Make your peace with the Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed Joffrey to your Sansa. Wed your younger girl to Prince Tommen, and your heir to Myrcella. It will be four years before Joffrey comes of age. By then he will look to you as a second father, and if not, well?.?.?.?four years is a good long while, my lord. Long enough to dispose of Lord Stannis. Then, should Joffrey prove troublesome, we can reveal his little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4378" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们再看看钱币的另一面。乔佛里眼下才十二岁，而且大人，劳勃选的舏政王是你啊。你既是首相，又是全境守护者。史塔克大人，你是大权在握，只需伸手便可夺取天下。与兰尼斯特家和好，释放小恶魔，让乔佛里和你的珊莎结婚，再把你的小女儿嫁给托曼，让你的继承人迎娶弥赛拉。距离乔佛里长大成人还有四年时间，到时候他会把您当成再世生父，就算他没有，这个嘛……大人，四年时间可也不短，足够把史坦尼斯大人解决掉了。之后若是乔佛里惹人厌，我们可以揭穿他的小秘密”然后把蓝礼大人送上王位。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4379');"><p>"We?" Ned repeated.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4379" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们？”奈德重复道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4380');"><p>Littlefinger gave a shrug. "You’ll need someone to share your burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4380" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头耸耸肩。“您总需要别人来帮您分担重责大任吧。我可以跟您保证，我的价码绝对最公道。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4381');"><p>"Your price." Ned’s voice was ice. "Lord Baelish, what you suggest is treason."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4381" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你的价码。”奈德声音冰冷。“贝里席大人，你刚才建议的可是叛国大罪。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4382');"><p>"Only if we lose."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4382" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“除非我们失败。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4383');"><p>"You forget," Ned told him. "You forget Jon Arryn. You forget Jory Cassel. And you forget this." He drew the dagger and laid it on the table between them; a length of dragonbone and Valyrian steel, as sharp as the difference between right and wrong, between true and false, between life and death. "They sent a man to cut my son’s throat, Lord Baelish."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4383" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你忘了，”奈德告诉他，“你忘了琼恩•艾林，你忘了乔里•凯索，你还忘了这个。”他抽出那把匕首，放在两人中间的桌上。由龙骨和瓦雷利亚精钢打造的短刀，锋利一如对与错、真与假，生与死之间的差异。“贝里席大人，他们派人杀我儿子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4384');"><p>Littlefinger sighed. "I fear I did forget, my lord. Pray forgive me. For a moment I did not remember that I was talking to a Stark." His mouth quirked. "So it will be Stannis, and war?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4384" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头叹口气。“恐怕我真是忘了，大人，请您原谅。我居然忘了自己在跟史塔克家的人说话。”他撇撇嘴。“所以就是史坦尼斯和战争？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4385');"><p>"It is not a choice. Stannis is the heir."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4385" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们别无选择，史坦尼斯是继承人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4386');"><p>"Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector. What would you have of me, then? Not my wisdom, for a certainty."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4386" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“反正我也没资格和全境守护者争辩。那么，您找我有何贵干？想必不是为了我的臹慧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4387');"><p>"I shall do my best to forget your?.?.?.?wisdom," Ned said with distaste. "I called you here to ask for the help you promised Catelyn. This is a perilous hour for all of us. Robert has named me Protector, true enough, but in the eyes of the world, Joffrey is still his son and heir. The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms who will do whatever she commands ?.?.?.?enough to overwhelm what remains of my own household guard. And for all I know, her brother Jaime may be riding for King’s Landing even as we speak, with a Lannister host at his back."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4387" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我会尽我所能忘记你的……臹慧，”奈德嫌恶地说，“我找你来，是因为你答应过凯特琳会帮忙。眼下对我们每个人都是危险时刻。劳勃的确任命我为守护者，但在世人眼中，乔佛里依旧是他的儿子和继承人。王后身边有十来个骑士和上百名侍卫听候差遣……足够对付我留在身边的护卫。况且就在我们说话的当口，她弟弟詹姆很可能正率领兰尼斯特大军，浩浩荡荡朝君临开来。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4388');"><p>"And you without an army." Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table, turning it slowly with a finger. "There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters. Bronze Yohn Royce, Ser Balon Swann, Ser Loras, Lady Tanda, the Redwyne twins?.?.?.?each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4388" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“而你却没有军队。”小指头把玩着桌上的匕首，用一根指头缓缓旋转。“蓝礼大人和兰尼斯特家之间素无好感。青铜约恩•罗伊斯，巴隆•史文爵士，洛拉斯爵士，坦妲伯爵夫人，还有雷德温家的双胞胎……他们各自有一批骑士和侍卫在城里。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4389');"><p>"Renly has thirty men in his personal guard, the rest even fewer. It is not enough, even if I could be certain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance. I must have the gold cloaks. The City Watch is two thousand strong, sworn to defend the castle, the city, and the king’s peace."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4389" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“蓝礼有三十个贴身护卫，其他人更少。就算他们全站到我这边，也还是不够。我需要都城守卫队的支持。他们一共有两千人，并宣誓守护城堡与市镇，以国王之名维护和平。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4390');"><p>"Ah, but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another, whose peace do they protect?" Lord Petyr flicked at the dagger with his finger, setting it spinning in place. Round and round it went, wobbling as it turned. When at last it slowed to a stop, the blade pointed at Littlefinger. "Why, there’s your answer," he said, smiling. "They follow the man who pays them." He leaned back and looked Ned full in the face, his grey-green eyes bright with mockery. "You wear your honor like a suit of armor, Stark. You think it keeps you safe, but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move. Look at you now. You know why you summoned me here. You know what you want to ask me to do. You know it has to be done?.?.?.?but it’s not honorable, so the words stick in your throat."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4390" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，可是当王后立了一个国王，首相却立了另一个，请问他们要以谁之名维护和平呢？”培提尔伯爵伸出手指轻推匕首，让它在原地打转。匕首旋转不息，边转边摇晃。最后速度减缓，终至停止时，刀尖正对着小指头。“唉，这就是答案啦。”他微笑道，“谁付钱，他们就听谁的话。”他向后靠上椅背，直直地看着奈德的脸，那双灰绿的眼睛里闪着嘲弄之色。“史塔克，你把荣誉当铠甲穿在身上，自以为能保你平安，结果却让自己负担沉重，行动困难。瞧你现在这个样子：你很清楚找我来目的为何，也知道要请我做什么，更明白这件事势在必行……可一点也不名誉，所以话哽在喉咙里说不出来。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4391');"><p>Ned’s neck was rigid with tension. For a moment he was so angry that he did not trust himself to speak.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4391" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德的颈项因为紧张而僵硬，有好一阵子他委实太过恼怒，以致不敢轻易开口。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4392');"><p>Littlefinger laughed. "I ought to make you say it, but that would be cruel?.?.?.?so have no fear, my good lord. For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn, I will go to Janos Slynt this very hour and make certain that the City Watch is yours. Six thousand gold pieces should do it. A third for the Commander, a third for the officers, a third for the men. We might be able to buy them for half that much, but I prefer not to take chances." Smiling, he plucked up the dagger and offered it to Ned, hilt first.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4392" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头笑道：“我应该逼你亲口说出来的，但那样太残忍啦……所以我亲爱的好大人，您别担心。为着我对凯特琳的爱，我这就去找杰诺斯•史林特，确保都城守卫队站在您这边。六千金龙应该足够。三分之一给司令，三分之一给各层士官，剩下的三分之一留给士兵。本来用这价钱的一半或许也行，不过我还是别冒险的好。”他面露微笑，拾起匕首交还奈德，刀柄朝向对方。
