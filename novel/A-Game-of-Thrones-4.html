</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_254');"><p>Her brother held the gown up for her inspection. "This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress the fabric."
</p></origin><translate id="div_254" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哥哥举起长袍给她看。“真漂亮，你摸摸看，没关系，你看看这料子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_255');"><p>Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. She could not remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. "Is it really mine?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_255" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮摸了摸，衣料柔软如水般流过她的手指，她从来没穿过这么柔软的衣服。她突然害怕了起来，连忙抽回手。”这真是给我的么？“ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_256');"><p>"A gift from the Magister Illyrio," Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood tonight. "The color will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio has promised. Tonight you must look like a princess."
</p></origin><translate id="div_256" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是伊利里欧总督送的礼物，”韦赛里斯微笑道。哥哥今晚心情很好。“袍子的颜色刚好衬出你紫罗兰色的眼睛。你还要配戴金饰，以及各式各样的珠宝玉石，今晚你看起来必须有个公主的样子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_257');"><p>A princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never really known. "Why does he give us so much?" she asked. "What does he want from us?" For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister’s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos.
</p></origin><translate id="div_257" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>有个公主的样子，丹妮想着。她早已忘记那是什么样子了，也许她根本就不知道。“他为什么对我们这么好？”她问道，“他想从我们这得到什么好处？”过去近半年来，他们吃住都靠这位总督，在他的仆佣伺候下待宠而骄。丹妮今年十三岁，已经懂得这种优渥的待遇不会凭空而来，尤其是在潘托斯这样的自由贸易城邦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_258');"><p>"Illyrio is no fool," Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes. "The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne."
</p></origin><translate id="div_258" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“伊利里欧可不笨，”韦赛里斯回答，他是个削瘦的年轻人，双手局促不安，苍白的淡紫色眼瞳里有种狂热的神色，“他知道有朝一日我重登王位时，不会忘记曾经雪中送炭的朋友。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_259');"><p>Dany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he’d never had a friend he wouldn’t cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible thing when roused. Viserys called it "waking the dragon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_259" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮没有答话。伊利里欧总督是个商人，专做香料、宝石、龙骨买卖，以及其他见不得人的勾当。据说他交游广阔，不仅辫布九个自由贸易城邦，更远至维斯•多斯拉克，以及玉海沿岸的传奇之地。又有人说，只要对方开得出价钱，任何朋友他都乐于出卖。 这些话丹妮都静静地听了进去，但她知道最好不要在兄长编织迷梦时戳破。韦赛里斯一旦生气起来非常骇人，他称之为“唤醒睡龙之怒”。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_260');"><p>Her brother hung the gown beside the door. "Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be sure you wash off the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of mount." He studied her critically. "You still slouch. Straighten yourself" He pushed back her shoulders with his hands. "Let them see that you have a woman’s shape now." His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple. "You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?" His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic. "Do you?" he repeated.
</p></origin><translate id="div_260" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哥哥把袍子挂在门边。“伊利里欧会派奴隶来伺候你沐浴，记得把身上的马膻味洗掉。卓戈卡奥（注解１）虽有千百良驹，但他今晚要骑的可是另一种马。”他仔细端详她说，“你还是弯腰驼背的老样子，要抬头挺胸。” 他伸手把她的肩膀往后挺。“让他们知道你已经有女人的样子了。”他的手指微微掠扫过她正开始发育的胸部，捏住一边乳头。“今晚你不许给我出丑，要是出了差错，以后可有你受的。你不想唤醒睡龙之怒吧？”；他的手指越捏越紧，隔着她的粗料外衣痛得不得了。“想不想？”他重复道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_261');"><p>"No," Dany said meekly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_261" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不想。”丹妮怯弱地回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_262');"><p>Her brother smiled. "Good." He touched her hair, almost with affection. "When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_262" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哥哥笑了，“很好，”他爱怜地轻抚她的秀发，“等将来史家为我立传的时候，他们会说我的统治时期由今晚开始。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_263');"><p>When he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo’s manse.
</p></origin><translate id="div_263" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他离开后，丹妮走到窗边，思慕地望着海湾。潘托斯的方砖高塔是斜阳残照里的黑色翦影，丹妮可以听见红袍僧点燃夜火时的诵唱祝祷，以及高墙外孩童玩耍时的笑闹喧哗。就在那一刹那，她好希望自己能在外面和他们一起赤足嬉戏，穿着破烂衣裳喘着气，没有过去，没有未来，也不用参加卓戈卡奥的宅邸晚宴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_264');"><p>Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. Her brother had a simpler name. "Our land," he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. "Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers."
</p></origin><translate id="div_264" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在夕阳狭海的彼岸，有个青陵纵横，花开平野，深河奔涌的地方，那里有高耸于壮丽灰蓝峰峦间的黑石巨塔，有高举鲜明旗臶赶赴沙场的铁甲武土。多斯拉克人称呼那个地方为“雷叙•安达里”，意思是“安达尔人之地”。在自由城邦里，人们则称之为“维斯特洛”和“日落国度”（注解２）。 哥哥有个更简单的说法，他称之为“我们的土地”。这个名字就像句祷词，彷佛只要他说得次数够多，就定能上达天听。“那是我们龙族血脉所继承的土地，虽然遭人以阴谋诡计所夺，但仍然属于我们，永远属于我们。没有人能从真龙手中偷走东西，门都没有，因为真龙凡事都永远记得。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_265');"><p>And perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. Viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled King’s Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother’s womb.
</p></origin><translate id="div_265" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>也许真龙真的记得吧，然而丹妮却记不得。那块位在海峡对岸，哥哥信誓旦旦属于他们的土地，她从来没有见过。那些他口中的名字，凯岩城、鹰巢城、高庭和艾林谷，冬恩领和千面屿等，对她来说不过是文字的拼凑罢了。当年他们躲避节节进逼的“篡夺者”（注解３）军队，被迫逃离君临时，韦赛里斯还是个八岁大的男孩，但丹妮只不过是母亲子宫里胎动的血肉罢了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_266');"><p>Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship’s black sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of King’s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper’s dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar’s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the Kingslayer opened Father’s throat with a golden sword.
</p></origin><translate id="div_266" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而哥哥的故事听多了，丹妮有时还是会在脑海里自行拼凑出过往的光景：他们乘着船影黑帆，在月光照洒下夜奔龙石岛，她的长兄雷加在染血的三叉戟河上与篡夺者做生死决斗，为他钟爱的女人丧命；兰尼斯特和史塔克家族的部队，那些韦赛里斯称做篡夺者走狗的部队，攻破君临，冬恩的伊莉亚公主苦苦哀求，却眼睁睁地看着她和雷加的亲生骨肉，那个还在她胸脯上吸吮母奶的婴儿，被硬生生夺走，血淋淋地惨死，抑或那些悬挂于王座大厅后方高墙上，巨龙末裔的亮磨头骨，瞎了的空洞眼窟看着“弑君者”用他那柄金色宝剑，切开父王的喉咙。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_267');"><p>She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_267" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>逃亡之后九个月，她降生在龙石岛，时值夏季暴风来袭，彷佛就要把城堡撕成碎片。 据说那场暴风雨骇人无比，停泊在军港里的坦格利安皇家舰队被摧毁殆尽，巨石自城垛上崩落，朝海峡里疯狂翻涌的潮水腾滚而去。她的母亲难产而死，为此韦赛里斯始终没有原谅她。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_268');"><p>She did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper’s brother set sail with his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast.
</p></origin><translate id="div_268" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而她也不记得龙石岛。他们继续亡命奔逃，就在“篡夺者”弟弟的舰队初成，率众来伐的前夕。当时原本属于他们的七大王国（注解４）之中，只剩下他们历史悠久的家族堡垒龙石岛尚未落入敌人手中。而就连这样的情形也维持不了多久，城中守军早已暗中计划把他们出卖给“篡夺者”。但有天夜里，威廉•戴利爵士带着四位死土杀进育婴房，把他们连同奶妈一同带走，在夜幕掩护下扬帆驶往布拉佛斯海岸。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_269');"><p>She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called her "Little Princess" and sometimes "My Lady," and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his bed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever.
</p></origin><translate id="div_269" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她依稀记得威廉•戴利爵士，他是个魁梧的灰胡壮汉，即使后来眼睛半盲了，还从病榻上高声怒吼发号施令。仆人们怕极了他，但他待丹妮始终亲切慈蔼，他唤她作“小公主”，有时则是“我的小姐”；他的双手犹如皮革般柔软。然而他始终没有离开病床，日夜被疾病的气息所缠绕，那是种湿热而恶心的甜味。那时他们住在布拉佛斯那栋有着红漆大门的房子里，丹妮有自己的房间，寝室窗外还有棵柠檬树。威廉爵士死后，仆人们把仅剩的一点钱全给偷走，没过多久他们便被逐出那栋宽敞红屋。当那扇红漆大门在他们背后关起来时，丹妮再也止不住眼泪。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_270');"><p>They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper’s hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.
</p></origin><translate id="div_270" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从那之后，他们开始了流浪的岁月，从布拉佛斯到密尔，从密尔到泰洛西，后来又到魁赫、瓦兰提斯和里斯，漂泊无依，未曾在一处落脚扎根。哥哥不肯定居下来，他总说“篡夺者”派来的杀手紧迫在后，然而丹妮却连半个刺客也没见着过。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_271');"><p>At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother’s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called her brother "the beggar king." Dany did not want to know what they called her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_271" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>起初各地的总督、大君和商界巨贾很乐于接待坦格利安后裔，但随着日子渐渐过去，“篡夺者”在铁王座上坐得越来越稳，原本为他们敞开的们一扇扇关了起来，他们的日子也日益艰苦。他们不得不卖掉仅有的细软，甚至是从母亲手中继承的最后几个金币。在Pentos，他们叫他哥哥为“乞丐国王”，丹妮并不喜欢这个称呼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_272');"><p>"We will have it all back someday, sweet sister," he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it. "The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King’s Landing, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back." Viserys lived for that day. All that Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the childhood she had never known.
</p></origin><translate id="div_272" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的好妹妹，有朝一日我们一定会收复失土。”韦赛里斯往往这么向她承诺，有时他边说手还会无法克臸地颤抖。“想想那些珠宝丝绸，龙石岛和君临，铁王座和七大王国，全都从我们手中将这些抢了过去，我们统统会要回来的。”韦赛里斯之所以活着就是为了那一天的到来，丹妮却只想重回那栋有红漆大门的宅院，想要她窗外的那株柠檬树，还有她失去的童年。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_273');"><p>There came a soft knock on her door. "Come," Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio’s servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister’s many Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was Illyrio’s favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_273" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>门上响起一阵轻敲。”进来。“丹妮从窗边回过神，伊利里欧的仆婢们走进屋内，鞠躬行礼，然后动手开始准备沐浴。他们皆为奴隶，是总督熟识的众多多斯拉克人酋长中某一位致赠的礼物。 潘托斯自由城里没有奴隶臸度。即便如此，他们仍旧是奴隶。那名瘦小而灰白如鼠的老妪总是不发一语，但另外那位年轻女孩正好弥补了这个空缺。她是个金发碧眼的十六岁少女，也是伊利里欧最宠爱的奴婢，工作时总是喋喋不休。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_274');"><p>They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany’s head and helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen. "Ours is the house of the dragon," he would say. "The fire is in our blood."
</p></origin><translate id="div_274" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她们在澡盆里放满从厨房提来的热水，洒了香油。女孩用条粗布巾裹住丹妮头发，然后搀扶她入浴。洗澡水滚烫无比，但丹妮莉丝没有吭声。她喜欢这种热，让她有干净的感觉。 更何况哥哥常对她说，坦格利安家族的人是不怕烫的。“我们是龙族传人，他常说 ‘血液里燃烧着熊熊烈焰。’” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_275');"><p>The old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. "Drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver." There was more like that, so much more, what a handsome man the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon archer. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his sisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian.
</p></origin><translate id="div_275" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老妇人仔细地为她梳洗，把她银白色的秀发扎成辪子，默默梳理纠结在一起的发束。 女孩一边为她刷背洗脚，一边告诉她她有多么幸运。“听说卓戈家财万贯，连奴隶的项圈都是金子做的。他的 ‘卡拉萨’（注解５）有十万名战士，他在维斯•多斯拉克城里的宫殿有两百个房间，还有用银子打造的门扉。”她说个不停，没完没了。她告诉丹妮卡奥有多么英俊，多么高大凶猛，在战场上又是如何地从不畏惧，说他是有史以来最优秀的骑手，如恶魔般的神舐手。 丹妮莉丝从头到尾不发一语，她总以为自己成年后嫁的人是章赛里斯。自“征服者”伊耿 （注解６）娶妹妹为妻伊始，数百年来坦格利安家族的成员向来是兄妹通婚。唯有如此，才能确保血脉纯正，这话韦赛里斯不知已经告诉她多少辫了。他们体内流淌的是王者的血液，古老瓦雷利亚民族的金色血液，骄傲真龙的血液。真龙绝不和寻常野兽苟合，坦格利安族人当然更不会将他们的血液和其他下等人种混杂在一起。然而现在韦赛里斯却打算把她卖给这个异乡的野蛮人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_276');"><p>When she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, and then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden torc emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_276" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>沐浴清净之后，女奴扶她起身，拿毛巾擦乾她的身体。女孩把她的头发梳理得亮如熔银，老妇则为她搽上原产多斯拉克人草原的花草香精，两腕、耳后、乳尖、双唇和下体各轻触一抹；接着为她穿上伊利里欧总督送来的内衣，再穿上深紫丝袍，衬出她的紫罗兰色眼瞳。女孩为她套上金边凉鞋，老妇又为她戴上宝冠，镶着紫水晶的黄金手镯。最后才是黄金打造的厚重项链，上头刻满古瓦雷利亚的文字。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_277');"><p>"Now you look all a princess," the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. She felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms.
</p></origin><translate id="div_277" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“现在你看起来总算有个公主的样子了。”装扮完毕之后，女孩惊叹道。丹妮转身看看自己在镶银穿衣镜里的模样，镜子是伊利里欧舔想周到提供的。“有个公主的样子，”她暗忖，但又忽然想起刚才女孩说过的话，说卓戈卡奥富可敌国，连他奴隶的项圈都是金子打造的，不禁浑身发冷，鸡皮疙瘩冒了出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_278');"><p>Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in the water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. "Stand there," he told her. "Turn around. Yes. Good. You look ?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_278" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哥哥在阴凉的门厅里等她，他坐在池塘边，探手在水里晃着。他看到她来了之后便站起身，带着评论意味地上下打量。“站过来，”他告诉她，“转过去，对，很好，你看起来……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_279');"><p>"Regal," Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. Gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold. "May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys," the magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard. "She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision," he told her brother. "Drogo will be enraptured."
</p></origin><translate id="div_279" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“很有皇家风范。”伊利里欧总督从过道里走出来，他虽然臃肿肥胖，走起路来却意外地轻盈优雅。他边走，一身肥肉边在宽松的火红丝臼外衣下晃动。他的每根手指头都有宝石闪闪发光，他的仆人也为他的黄色胡须擦油，亮得就像是真金。“丹妮莉丝公主，愿你在这个黄道吉日里，得到光之神的所有祝福。”总督说完牵起她的手，低头行礼，透过金色胡须，露出满嘴黄牙。“王子殿下，就算是梦中佳人也不过如此啊！”他告诉哥哥，“卓戈一定会满意的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_280');"><p>"She’s too skinny," Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, gaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that Illyrio had lent him, and said, "Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_280" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她实在太瘦了，”韦赛里斯说。他的头发和丹妮一样是淡银，梳理到头后面，用一根龙骨发夹固定。他过分凝重的神色凸显了他僵硬枯槁的面容，手放在伊利里欧借给他的配剑柄上。“你确定卓戈卡奥喜欢这么年轻的女人么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_281');"><p>"She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal," Illyrio told him, not for the first time. "Look at her.

"Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us.

They were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria. Oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. Beneath an arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. "Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third of his Name," he called in a high, sweet voice, "King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer Isles with skin as black as ebony.

His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs.
