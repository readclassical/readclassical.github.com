</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1921');"><p>Her father had been fighting with the council again. Arya could see it on his face when he came to table, late again, as he had been so often. The first course, a thick sweet soup made with pumpkins, had already been taken away when Ned Stark strode into the Small Hall. They called it that to set it apart from the Great Hall, where the king could feast a thousand, but it was a long room with a high vaulted ceiling and bench space for two hundred at its trestle tables.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1921" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那天父亲大人又是很晚才来用饭，艾莉亚看得出他又跟朝廷闹意见了。当奈德•史塔克大跨步走进“小厅”的时候，晚餐的第一道菜，那锅浓稠的南瓜甜汤，早已被撤下桌去。他们把这儿叫做“小厅”，用以区别国王那足以容纳千人的大厅。话虽如此，这里却也不小，这是一间有着高耸圆顶的狭长房间，长凳上坐得下两百号人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1922');"><p>"My lord," Jory said when Father entered. He rose to his feet, and the rest of the guard rose with him. Each man wore a new cloak, heavy grey wool with a white satin border. A hand of beaten silver clutched the woolen folds of each cloak and marked their wearers as men of the Hand’s household guard. There were only fifty of them, so most of the benches were empty.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1922" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人。”父亲进来时，乔里开口说。他站起来，其余的侍卫也立即起身，他们个个穿着厚重的灰羊毛滚白缎边的新斗篷，褶层上绣了一只银手，辬示他们是首相的贴身护卫。由于总共才五十人，因此长凳显得空荡荡的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1923');"><p>"Be seated," Eddard Stark said. "I see you have started without me. I am pleased to know there are still some men of sense in this city." He signaled for the meal to resume. The servants began bringing out platters of ribs, roasted in a crust of garlic and herbs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1923" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“坐下罢。”艾德•史塔克道，“我很高兴这城里就你们还有点常识，至少知道先开动。”他示意大家继续用餐，侍者端出一盘盘用蒜头和草药包裹的烤排骨。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1924');"><p>"The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord," Jory said as he resumed his seat. "They say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of the King."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1924" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“老爷，外面人人都在传说要举办一场比武大会。”乔里坐回位子。“听说全国各地的骑士都会前来，为您的荣誉而战，庆祝您走马上任。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1925');"><p>Arya could see that her father was not very happy about that. "Do they also say this is the last thing in the world I would have wished?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1925" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚看得出父亲对此不甚高兴。“他们怎么不说这是我最不愿见到的事？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1926');"><p>Sansa’s eyes had grown wide as the plates. "A tourney," she breathed. She was seated between Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, as far from Arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from Father. "Will we be permitted to go, Father?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1926" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎的眼睛睁得跟盘子一样大。“比武大会。”她吸了口气。她坐在茉丹修女和珍妮•普尔中间，在不引起父亲注意的范围内，尽可能离艾莉亚远远的。“父亲大人，我们可以去吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1927');"><p>"You know my feelings, Sansa. It seems I must arrange Robert’s games and pretend to be honored for his sake. That does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1927" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“珊莎，你知道我对这件事的看法。这档蠢事分明是劳勃自己的主意，我帮他筹办也就算了，还得假装受宠若惊，但那不代表我必须带女儿去参加。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1928');"><p>"Oh, please," Sansa said. "I want to see."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1928" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎哟，拜托嘛。”珊莎说，“人家好想去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1929');"><p>Septa Mordane spoke up. "Princess Myrcella will be there, my lord, and her younger than Lady Sansa. All the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this, and as the tourney is in your honor, it would look queer if your family did not attend."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1929" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>茉丹修女开口：“老爷，届时弥赛公主也会出席，而她年纪比珊莎小姐还小。遇到这种盛事，宫廷里的仕女们都应该出席。更何况这届比武大会以您之名举办的，您的家人若不到场，可能有些不妥。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1930');"><p>Father looked pained. "I suppose so. Very well, I shall arrange a place for you, Sansa." He saw Arya. "For both of you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1930" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲神色痛苦。“我想也是。也罢，珊莎，我就帮你安排个席位。”他看看艾莉亚。“帮你们两个都弄个席位。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1931');"><p>"I don’t care about their stupid tourney," Arya said. She knew Prince Joffrey would be there, and she hated Prince Joffrey.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1931" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我才没兴趣参加什么无聊的比武会呢。”艾莉亚说。她知道乔佛里王子到时候一定也在场，而她恨死乔佛里王子了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1932');"><p>Sansa lifted her head. "It will be a splendid event. You shan’t be wanted."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1932" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎昂头道：“这会是一场盛况空前的庆祝。本来也没人希望你参加。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1933');"><p>Anger flashed across Father’s face. "Enough, Sansa. More of that and you will change my mind. I am weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting. You are sisters. I expect you to behave like sisters, is that understood?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1933" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲听了满脸怒容。“够了，珊莎。再说下去，小心我改变主意。我已经被你们俩没完没了的争吵给烦死了。再怎么说你们都是亲姐妹，我希望你们像姐妹一样相亲相爱，知道了么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1934');"><p>Sansa bit her lip and nodded. Arya lowered her face to stare sullenly at her plate. She could feel tears stinging her eyes. She rubbed them away angrily, determined not to cry.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1934" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎咬着嘴唇点点头，艾莉亚低头不快地盯着眼前的餐盘，感觉到泪水刺痛眼睛。她愤怒地抹掉眼泪，决心不要哭。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1935');"><p>The only sound was the clatter of knives and forks. "Pray excuse me," her father announced to the table. "I find I have small appetite tonight." He walked from the hall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1935" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>四周只剩下刀叉碰触的声音。“很抱歉，”父亲对全桌的人说，“今晚我没什么胃口。”说完他便走出小厅。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1936');"><p>After he was gone, Sansa exchanged excited whispers with Jeyne Poole. Down the table Jory laughed at a joke, and Hullen started in about h orseflesh. "Your warhorse, now, he may not be the best one for the joust. Not the same thing, oh, no, not the same at all." The men had heard it all before; Desmond, Jacks, and Hullen’s son Harwin shouted him down together, and Porther called for more wine.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1936" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他离开之后，珊莎立刻兴奋地和珍妮•普尔窃窃私语起来。坐在长桌彼端的乔里有说有笑，胡伦也开始大谈马经。“我说啊，你那匹战马实在不是比武的最佳选择，这和平时骑完全是两码事，懂吗？完全两码事。”这套说词其他人很早就听过，戴斯蒙、杰克斯和胡伦的儿子哈尔温齐声要他闭嘴，波瑟则叫人多来点葡萄酒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1937');"><p>No one talked to Arya. She didn’t care. She liked it that way. She would have eaten her meals alone in her bedchamber if they let her. Sometimes they did, when Father had to dine with the king or some lord or the envoys from this place or that place. The rest of the time, they ate in his solar, just him and her and Sansa. That was when Arya missed her brothers most. She wanted to tease Bran and play with baby Rickon and have Robb smile at her. She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her "little sister" and finish her sentences with her. But all of them were gone. She had no one left but Sansa, and Sansa wouldn’t even talk to her unless Father made her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1937" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>偏偏没人跟艾莉亚说话。其实她也不在乎，她还挺喜欢这种情形。若非大人们不准，她宁愿躲在卧房里吃。遇到父亲和国王、某某爵爷或某某使节共进晚餐的时候，她就可以得逞。不过多半，她跟父亲和姐姐三人在首相书房里用餐。每当这种时候，艾莉亚最想念哥哥弟弟。她想取笑布兰，想跟小瑞肯玩闹，想让罗柏含笑看着自己。她想要琼恩弄乱她的头发，叫她“我的小妹”，然后和她异口同声说出一句话。如今她只有珊莎为伴，但除非父亲逼迫，否则珊莎一句话都不和她讲。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1938');"><p>Back at Winterfell, they had eaten in the Great Hall almost half the time. Her father used to say that a lord needed to eat with his men, if he hoped to keep them. "Know the men who follow you," she heard him tell Robb once, "and let them know you. Don’t ask your men to die for a stranger." At Winterfell, he always had an extra seat set at his own table, and every day a different man would be asked to join him. One night it would be Vayon Poole, and the talk would be coppers and bread stores and servants. The next time it would be Mikken, and her father would listen to him go on about armor and swords and how hot a forge should be and the best way to temper steel. Another day it might be Hullen with his endless horse talk, or Septon Chayle from the library, or Jory, or Ser Rodrik, or even Old Nan with her stories.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1938" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从前在临冬城，他们常在城堡大厅用餐。父亲总是说，做领主的必须要和手下一同进食，如此才能留住他们的心。“你不但要了解自己的部下，”有次她听父亲这么对罗柏说，“还必须让他们也了解你。别想叫你的手下为一个他们所不认识的人卖命。”在临冬城，他总会在自己的餐桌上特别留出一个座位，每晚请来不同的人。如果请来维扬•普尔，谈的便是财务状况、粮食补给和仆人们的事。下次若换成密肯，父亲便会听他分析盔甲宝剑，解说炼钢打铁时风炉的热度。有时候则是三句不离养马的胡伦，管理图书室的柴尔修士，或是乔里，罗德利克爵士，甚至是最会说故事的老奶妈。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1939');"><p>Arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her father’s table and listen to them talk. She had loved listening to the men on the benches too; to freeriders tough as leather, courtly knights and bold young squires, grizzled old men-at-arms. She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen. Their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played monsters-and-maidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with their children. Fat Tom used to call her "Arya Underfoot," because he said that was where she always was. She’d liked that a lot better than "Arya Horseface."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1939" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚最喜欢坐在父亲桌边听他们说话，她也喜欢听坐在下方长凳上的人们说话：坚毅粗鲁的自由骑手，彬彬有礼的成年骑士，口无遮拦的年轻侍从，饱经风霜的沙场老兵。以前她常朝他们丢雪球，或帮他们从厨房里夹带馅饼。他们的妻子会烤饼给她吃，她则替她们的宝宝起名字，和她们的孩子玩“美女与怪兽”、比赛寻宝、做城堡游戏。胖汤姆老爱叫她“捣蛋鬼艾莉亚”，因为他说她老是跑来跑去。她喜欢这个绰号远胜过“马脸艾莉亚”.
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1940');"><p>Only that was Winterfell, a world away, and now everything was changed. This was the first time they had supped with the men since arriving in King’s Landing. Arya hated it. She hated the sounds of their voices now, the way they laughed, the stories they told. They’d been her friends, she’d felt safe around them, but now she knew that was a lie. They’d let the queen kill Lady, that was horrible enough, but then the Hound found Mycah. Jeyne Poole had told Arya that he’d cut him up in so many pieces that they’d given him back to the butcher in a bag, and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig they’d slaughtered. And no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything, not Harwin who always talked so bold, or Alyn who was going to be a knight, or Jory who was captain of the guard. Not even her father.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1940" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>只可惜那都是发生在临冬城的事，仿佛是另一个世界，现在一切都变了。说来今天是他们抵达君临以来头一次和下人一同用餐，艾莉亚却恨透了这种安排。她恨透了其他人说话的声音，恨透了他们开怀大笑的方式，以及他们所说的故事。他们曾经是她的朋友，与他们为伍曾让她很有安全感，如今她知道这全是假的。他们袖手旁观，让王后杀了淑女，这本来已经够糟，后来又任“猎狗”逮着了米凯。珍妮•普尔告诉艾莉亚，他把米凯大卸八块，人们只好把尸体用袋子装起来交还屠夫，只可怜那杀猪匠起初还以为里面装的是刚杀的猪仔。没有人对此臼疑或拔刀相助，什么都没有，不管是最会吹嘘自己勇敢的哈尔温，还是立志要当骑士的埃林，或是身为侍卫队长的乔里，就连父亲也没有出面阻止。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1941');"><p>"He was my friend," Arya whispered into her plate, so low that no one could hear. Her ribs sat there untouched, grown cold now, a thin film of grease congealing beneath them on the plate. Arya looked at them and felt ill. She pushed away from the table.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1941" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他是我朋友呀。”艾莉亚对着餐盘低语，声音低到无人听见。她的排骨躺在盘里，动也没动，已经冷掉了，餐盘和肉块间凝了一层油。艾莉亚越看越恶心，便推开椅子站起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1942');"><p>"Pray, where do you think you are going, young lady?" Septa Mordane asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1942" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“等等，小姐，你要去哪里啊？”茉丹修女问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1943');"><p>"I’m not hungry." Arya found it an effort to remember her courtesies. "May I be excused, please?" she recited stiffly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1943" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不饿。”艾莉亚想起要顾及礼节。“请问，我可以先告退吗？”她生硬地背诵道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1944');"><p>"You may not," the septa said. "You have scarcely touched your food. You will sit down and clean your plate."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1944" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还不行，”修女说，“你的东西几乎都没吃，请你坐下来先把盘里的食物清干净。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1945');"><p>"You clean it!" Before anyone could stop her, Arya bolted for the door as the men laughed and Septa Mordane called loudly after her, her voice rising higher and higher.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1945" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要清你自己清！”趁人们还没反应过来，艾莉亚便往门边奔去。其他人哈哈大笑，茉丹修女则跟在后面大声叫唤，声音越来越高。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1946');"><p>Fat Tom was at his post, guarding the door to the Tower of the Hand. He blinked when he saw Arya rushing toward him and heard the septa’s shouts. "Here now, little one, hold on," he started to say, reaching, but Arya slid between his legs and then she was running up the winding tower steps, her feet hammering on the stone while Fat Tom huffed and puffed behind her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1946" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>胖汤姆守在岗位上，负责把守通往首相塔的门。眼见艾莉亚朝自己冲来，又听见后面修女的喊叫，他眨了眨眼。“哟呼，小娃娃，别乱跑呀。”他才刚开口，准备伸手阻拦，艾莉亚便已穿过他胯下，跑上迂回的高塔楼梯。她的脚步重重地踩在石阶上，胖汤姆则气喘吁吁地跟在后面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1947');"><p>Her bedchamber was the only place that Arya liked in all of King’s Landing, and the thing she liked best about it was the door, a massive slab of dark oak with black iron bands. When she slammed that door and dropped the heavy crossbar, nobody could get into her room, not Septa Mordane or Fat Tom or Sansa or Jory or the Hound, nobody! She slammed it now.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1947" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>诺大的君临城，艾莉亚惟一喜欢的地方就是自己的卧室，尤其是那扇用深色橡木做成，镶有黑铁环的厚重大门。她只要把门一摔，放下沉重的门闩，便谁也别想进来。不论茉丹修女、胖汤姆、珊莎、乔里还是死猎狗，他们都进不来，通通都进不来！这会儿她就把门一摔。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1948');"><p>When the bar was down, Arya finally felt safe enough to cry.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1948" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等门闩放好，艾莉亚终于觉得自己可以尽情地哭了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1949');"><p>She went to the window seat and sat there, sniffling, hating them all, and herself most of all. It was all her fault, everything bad that had happened. Sansa said so, and Jeyne too.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1949" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她走到窗边坐下，一边吸着鼻涕，一边痛恨着所有的人，尤其恨她自己。一切都是她的错，所有的事都因她而起。珊莎这么说，珍妮也这么说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1950');"><p>Fat Tom was knocking on her door. "Arya girl, what’s wrong?" he called out. "You in there?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1950" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>胖汤姆正在敲门。“艾莉亚小妹，怎么啦？”他叫道，“你在里面吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1951');"><p>"No!" she shouted. The knocking stopped. A moment later she heard him going away. Fat Tom was always easy to fool.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1951" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不在！”她吼回去。敲门声停了，片刻之后她听见他走远的声音。胖汤姆向来很好骗。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1952');"><p>Arya went to the chest at the foot of her bed. She knelt, opened the lid, and began pulling her clothes out with both hands, grabbing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool and tossing them on the floor. It was there at the bottom of the chest, where she’d hidden it. Arya lifted it out almost tenderly and drew the slender blade from its sheath.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1952" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚拖出放在床脚的箱子，她跪下来，掀开盖子，双手并用，开始把她的衣服往外丢，把满手丝臼、绸缎、天鹅绒、羊毛织的衣物扔到地板上。东西藏在箱底，艾莉亚轻轻地捧起它，抽出剑鞘。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1953');"><p>Needle.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1953" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>缝衣针。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1954');"><p>She thought of Mycah again and her eyes filled with tears. Her fault, her fault, her fault. If she had never asked him to play at swords with her?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_1954" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她想起米凯，顿时泪水盈眶。是她的错，她的错，她的错。如果她没要他跟自己练剑…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1955');"><p>There was a pounding at her door, louder than before. "Arya Stark, you open this door at once, do you hear me?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1955" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>门上响起更大的敲门声。“艾莉亚•史塔克，立刻把门给我打开，你听见了没有？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1956');"><p>Arya spun around, with Needle in her hand. "You better not come in here!" she warned. She slashed at the air savagely.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1956" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚倏地转身，手中紧握“缝衣针”，“你不要进来！”她出声警告，一边对着空气疯狂挥砍。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1957');"><p>"The Hand will hear of this!" Septa Mordane raged.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1957" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我会让首相知道这件事！”茉丹修女怒喝。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1958');"><p>"I don’t care," Arya screamed. "Go away."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1958" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不管。”艾莉亚尖叫，“走开。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1959');"><p>"You will rue this insolent behavior, young lady, I promise you that." Arya listened at the door until she heard the sound of the septa’s receding footsteps.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1959" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小姐，我跟你保证，你一定会为自己粗野的行为而后悔。”艾莉亚在门边侧耳倾听，直到听见修女渐行渐远的脚步声。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1960');"><p>She went back to the window, Needle in hand, and looked down into the courtyard below. If only she could climb like Bran, she thought; she would go out the window and down the tower, run away from this horrible place, away from Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey, from all of them. Steal some food from the kitchens, take Needle and her good boots and a warm cloak. She could find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, and together they’d return to Winterfell, or run to Jon on the Wall. She found herself wishing that Jon was here with her now. Then maybe she wouldn’t feel so alone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1960" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她又回到窗边，手里握着 “缝衣针”，朝下方的庭院望去。要是她能像布兰一样爬上爬下就好了，她心想，那么她就能爬出窗户，爬下高塔，逃离这个烂地方，远离珊莎、茉丹修女和乔佛里王子，远离所有的人。顺便从厨房偷点吃的，带上“缝衣针”，上好的靴子，外加一件保暖的斗篷。她可以在三叉戟河下游的森林里找到娜梅莉亚，然后她们就可以一起回临冬城，或跑到长城去找琼恩了。她发现自己好希望琼恩此刻在自己身边，那样她就不会觉得这么孤单了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1961');"><p>A soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape. "Arya," her father’s voice called out. "Open the door. We need to talk."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1961" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>轻轻的敲门声将艾莉亚从她的脱逃梦里拉回现实。“艾莉亚，”父亲唤道，“开门罢，我们需要谈谈。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1962');"><p>Arya crossed the room and lifted the crossbar. Father was alone. He seemed more sad than angry. That made Arya feel even worse. "May I come in?" Arya nodded, then dropped her eyes, ashamed. Father closed the door. "Whose sword is that?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1962" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚穿过房间，举起门闩。只见父亲独自一人站在门外，那样子与其说是生气，毋宁说是悲伤。这却让艾莉亚更难过。“我可以进来吗？”艾莉亚点点头，羞愧地垂下视线。父亲关上门。“那把剑是谁的？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1963');"><p>"Mine." Arya had almost forgotten Needle, in her hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1963" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的。”艾莉亚忘了“缝衣针”还握在自己手里。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1964');"><p>"Give it to me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1964" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“给我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1965');"><p>Reluctantly Arya surrendered her sword, wondering if she would ever hold it again. Her father turned it in the light, examining both sides of the blade. He tested the point with his thumb. "A bravo’s blade," he said. "Yet it seems to me that I know this maker’s mark. This is Mikken’s work."

Arya heard sadness in his voice; he did not often speak of his father, or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born.
