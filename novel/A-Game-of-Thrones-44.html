</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3939');"><p>Through the high narrow windows of the Red Keep’s cavernous throne room, the light of sunset spilled across the floor, laying dark red stripes upon the walls where the heads of dragons had once hung. Now the stone was covered with hunting tapestries, vivid with greens and browns and blues, and yet still it seemed to Ned Stark that the only color in the hall was the red of blood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3939" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>透过红堡深广王座厅的狭窄高窗，夕阳余晖辫洒地面，为墙壁挂上暗红色的条纹。龙头曾经高悬于此，如今石墙虽已为青绿和棕褐相衬、栩栩如生地描绘狩猎情景的挂毯织锦所覆盖，但在奈德眼中，整个大厅依旧浸润在一片血红之中。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3940');"><p>He sat high upon the immense ancient seat of Aegon the Conqueror, an ironwork monstrosity of spikes and jagged edges and grotesquely twisted metal. It was, as Robert had warned him, a hellishly uncomfortable chair, and never more so than now, with his shattered leg throbbing more sharply every minute. The metal beneath him had grown harder by the hour, and the fanged steel behind made it impossible to lean back. A king should never sit easy, Aegon the Conqueror had said, when he commanded his armorers to forge a great seat from the swords laid down by his enemies. Damn Aegon for his arrogance, Ned thought sullenly, and damn Robert and his hunting as well.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3940" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他高高坐在“征服者”伊耿宽大而古老的座位上。那是张钢铁铸成，满是狰狞尖刺利角和诡异扭曲金属的椅子，它正如劳勃所警告的那般，是张天杀的不舒服的椅子。眼下他的断腿不住抽痛，这种感觉更是无以复加。他身子底下的金属每一小时都越显坚硬，布满利齿般尖刺的椅背，更教他无法倚靠。当年征服者伊耿命令手下铁匠使用敌人投降时的弃械，镕铸成一张大椅时，曾说：“作国王的不能舒舒服服地坐着”。伊耿这傲慢的家伙该死，奈德阴沉地想，劳勃和他的打猎游戏也该死。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3941');"><p>"You are quite certain these were more than brigands?" Varys asked softly from the council table beneath the throne. Grand Maester Pycelle stirred uneasily beside him, while Littlefinger toyed with a pen. They were the only councillors in attendance. A white hart had been sighted in the kingswood, and Lord Renly and Ser Barristan had joined the king to hunt it, along with Prince Joffrey, Sandor Clegane, Balon Swann, and half the court. So Ned must needs sit the Iron Throne in his absence.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3941" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你能确定他们不是土匪毛贼？”坐在王座下方议事桌边的瓦里斯轻声问。他身旁的派席尔大学士坐立难安，小指头则摆弄着一枝笔。列席的重臣只有他们几个。前几天有人在御林里瞧见了一只白公鹿，蓝礼大人和巴利斯坦爵士便陪伴国王前去打猎，同行的还有乔佛里王子、桑铎•克里冈、巴隆•史文以及半数廷臣。正因如此，奈德才不得不暂代劳勃坐在铁王座上处理国事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3942');"><p>At least he could sit. Save the council, the rest must stand respectfully, or kneel. The petitioners clustered near the tall doors, the knights and high lords and ladies beneath the tapestries, the smallfolk in the gallery, the mailed guards in their cloaks, gold or grey: all stood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3942" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>好歹他还有椅子可坐。在王座厅里，除了王室家族和几位重臣，余人都得毕恭毕敬地或站或跪。前来请愿的人群聚大门边，骑士、贵族与仕女站在挂毯下，平民百姓则在走廊上。全副武装的卫兵肩披金色或灰色的披风，威严挺立。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3943');"><p>The villagers were kneeling: men, women, and children, alike tattered and bloody, their faces drawn by fear. The three knights who had brought them here to bear witness stood behind them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3943" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这群村民单膝下跪，不论男女老少，清一色衣着破烂，满身血污，脸上刻满了恐惧。带他们进来作证的三位骑士站在后面。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3944');"><p>"Brigands, Lord Varys?" Ser Raymun Darry’s voice dripped scorn. "Oh, they were brigands, beyond a doubt. Lannister brigands."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3944" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“土匪？瓦里斯大人，”雷蒙•戴瑞爵士语透轻蔑。“哼，说得好，他们当然是土匪了。兰尼斯特家的土匪。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3945');"><p>Ned could feel the unease in the hall, as high lords and servants alike strained to listen. He could not pretend to surprise. The west had been a tinderbox since Catelyn had seized Tyrion Lannister. Both Riverrun and Casterly Rock had called their banners, and armies were massing in the pass below the Golden Tooth. It had only been a matter of time until the blood began to flow. The sole question that remained was how best to stanch the wound.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3945" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德感觉得到大厅里的紧张气氛，在场人等不论出身高低，均屏息竖耳倾听。这也不是什么新鲜事，自凯特琳逮捕提利昂•兰尼斯特之后，西境便宛如一座柴火库。奔流城与凯岩城均已召集封臣，此刻两军正向金牙城下的山口聚集。爆发流血冲突是迟早的事。现在惟一的问题是如何能将伤害减到最小。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3946');"><p>Sad-eyed Ser Karyl Vance, who would have been handsome but for the winestain birthmark that discolored his face, gestured at the kneeling villagers. "This is all the remains of the holdfast of Sherrer, Lord Eddard. The rest are dead, along with the people of Wendish Town and the Mummer’s Ford."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3946" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>满眼忧伤，若非脸上酒红色的胎记，本来还算英俊的卡列尔•凡斯爵士指着跪在地上的村民说：“艾德大人，榭尔全村就只剩这些人，其他的都和温德镇、戏子滩的居民一样，通通死光了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3947');"><p>"Rise," Ned commanded the villagers. He never trusted what a man told him from his knees. "All of you, up."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3947" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“起来，”奈德命令村民们。他向来不相信一个人跪着的时候所说的话。“你们通通都起来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3948');"><p>In ones and twos, the holdfast of Sherrer struggled to its feet. One ancient needed to be helped, and a young girl in a bloody dress stayed on her knees, staring blankly at Ser Arys Oakheart, who stood by the foot of the throne in the white armor of the Kingsguard, ready to protect and defend the king?.?.?.?or, Ned supposed, the King’s Hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3948" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>榭尔的居民听了纷纷挣扎着起身。一位老者要靠人搀扶才能站起，另一个穿着血衣的女孩则维持跪姿，怔怔地望着亚历斯•奥克赫特爵士。他身穿御林铁卫的白袍白甲，站在王座下方，随时准备誓死保卫国王……或者，奈德猜测，保卫国王的首相。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3949');"><p>"Joss," Ser Raymun Darry said to a plump balding man in a brewer’s apron. "Tell the Hand what happened at Sherrer."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3949" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“乔斯，”雷蒙•戴瑞爵士对一位穿着酿酒师傅围裙的光头胖子说，“快跟首相大人说榭尔发生了什么事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3950');"><p>Joss nodded. "If it please His Grace..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3950" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔斯点点头。“启禀国王陛下——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3951');"><p>"His Grace is hunting across the Blackwater," Ned said, wondering how a man could live his whole life a few days ride from the Red Keep and still have no notion what his king looked like. Ned was clad in a white linen doublet with the direwolf of Stark on the breast; his black wool cloak was fastened at the collar by his silver hand of office. Black and white and grey, all the shades of truth. "I am Lord Eddard Stark, the King’s Hand. Tell me who you are and what you know of these raiders."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3951" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“国王陛下他正在黑水湾对岸打猎，”奈德一边说，一边自忖一个人有没有可能终生居住在距红堡仅几日骑程的地方，却仍旧对国王的相貌一无所知。奈德穿着白色的亚麻外衣，胸前绣有史塔克家族的冰原狼纹章，黑羊毛披风用象征职位的银手徽章别在颈边。黑白灰三色，正是真理的三种可能。“我是国王之手，即御前首相艾德•史塔克公爵。告诉我你是谁，以及你对这些强盗所知的一切。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3952');"><p>"I keep?.?.?.?I kept?.?.?.?I kept an alehouse, m’lord, in Sherrer, by the stone bridge. The finest ale south of the Neck, everyone said so, begging your pardons, m’lord. It’s gone now like all the rest, m’lord. They come and drank their fill and spilled the rest before they fired my roof, and they would of spilled my blood too, if they’d caught me. M’lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3952" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“俺开了……以前俺开了……以前俺开了家酒馆，大人，在榭尔，就在石桥旁边。大家都说俺酿的麦酒是颈泽以南最好的，大人，请您见谅。可是大人，现在全都没了。他们进来喝饱以后又把剩下的倒掉，然后放火烧了房子，本来啊，大人，本来他们还打算要俺命，可他们没逮着。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3953');"><p>"They burnt us out," a farmer beside him said. "Come riding in the dark, up from the south, and fired the fields and the houses alike, killing them as tried to stop them. They weren’t no raiders, though, m’lord. They had no mind to steal our stock, not these, they butchered my milk cow where she stood and left her for the flies and the crows."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3953" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们放火把咱逼走，”他旁边的一个农夫说，“大半夜里从南方来，把田啊房子啊通通给烧了，谁要是敢上前阻拦就没命。可是大人，他们不是强盗，因为他们根本不是来抢东西，他们把我的乳牛宰了之后，把尸体丢在那儿喂苍蝇和乌鸦。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3954');"><p>"They rode down my ’prentice boy," said a squat man with a smith’s muscles and a bandage around his head. He had put on his finest clothes to come to court, but his breeches were patched, his cloak travel-stained and dusty. "Chased him back and forth across the fields on their horses, poking at him with their lances like it was a game, them laughing and the boy stumbling and screaming till the big one pierced him clean through."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3954" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们还把我徒弟活活踩死，”一个有着铁匠的肌肉，头上包了绷带的矮胖男子说。看得出他特别换上最好的衣服上朝，但那条裤子却布满补丁，斗篷也是风尘仆仆。“他们骑在马上哈哈大笑，追着他跑来跑去，还拿枪戳他，当成是在玩游戏。那孩子就这样跑啊，惨叫个不停，最后摔倒在地，被块头最大那家伙一枪刺死。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3955');"><p>The girl on her knees craned her head up at Ned, high above her on the throne. "They killed my mother too, Your Grace. And they?.?.?.?they?.?.?.?" Her voice trailed off, as if she had forgotten what she was about to say. She began to sob.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3955" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>跪在地上的女孩伸长脖子抬头看着高高在上的奈德。“陛下，他们还杀了我娘。然后他们……他们……”她的话音渐弱，仿佛忘了原本要说些什么，自顾自地啼哭了起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3956');"><p>Ser Raymun Darry took up the tale. "At Wendish Town, the people sought shelter in their holdfast, but the walls were timbered. The raiders piled straw against the wood and burnt them all alive. When the Wendish folk opened their gates to flee the fire, they shot them down with arrows as they came running out, even women with suckling babes."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3956" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>雷蒙•戴瑞爵士接过话茬：“温德镇的居民躲进庄园，可房子乃是木臸，入侵者便将其铺上稻草，把他们活活烧死在里面。有些人开门冲出火场逃走，他们便用弓箭舐杀，连怀抱奶娃的女人也不放过。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3957');"><p>"Oh, dreadful," murmured Varys. "How cruel can men be?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3957" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎哟，真是可怕，”瓦里斯喃喃道，“怎么会有人如此残忍呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3958');"><p>"They would of done the same for us, but the Sherrer holdfast’s made of stone," Joss said. "Some wanted to smoke us out, but the big one said there was riper fruit upriver, and they made for the Mummer’s Ford."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3958" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们本来也要这么对付俺们，幸好榭尔的庄园是石头做的，”乔斯道，“有人想用烟把俺们薰出来，可那大块头说河上游比较有收获，就奔戏子滩去了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3959');"><p>Ned could feel cold steel against his fingers as he leaned forward. Between each finger was a blade, the points of twisted swords fanning out like talons from arms of the throne. Even after three centuries, some were still sharp enough to cut. The Iron Throne was full of traps for the unwary. The songs said it had taken a thousand blades to make it, heated white-hot in the furnace breath of Balerion the Black Dread. The hammering had taken fifty-nine days. The end of it was this hunched black beast made of razor edges and barbs and ribbons of sharp metal; a chair that could kill a man, and had, if the stories could be believed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3959" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德身体前倾，手指触碰到冰冷的金属。他每根指头间都是一柄刀刃，尖端是弯曲的利剑，有如爪子般从王座的扶手向外伸展。虽然历经了三个世纪，其中有些刃叶依旧锋利逼人。对粗心大意的人来说，铁王座称得上机关密布。歌谣里唱着当初花了一千把剑，经过黑死神贝勒里恩的烈焰加热熔解，方才铸成王座。敲敲打打前后总共花了五十九天，最后的成品就是如今这座边缘如剃刀般锋利，无处不是倒钩和纠结的驼背黑怪物。这张椅子可以杀人，倘若传说属实，还真的杀过。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3960');"><p>What Eddard Stark was doing sitting there he would never comprehend, yet there he sat, and these people looked to him for justice. "What proof do you have that these were Lannisters?" he asked, trying to keep his fury under control. "Did they wear crimson cloaks or fly a lion banner?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3960" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾德•史塔克并不想坐上来，但如今他高踞于此，而下面的人民前来请求他主持正义。“你们有何证据指明这些是兰尼斯特家族的人？”他问，同时努力压抑怒气。“他们穿了红披风或打着狮子旗吗?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3961');"><p>"Even Lannisters are not so blind stupid as that," Ser Marq Piper snapped. He was a swaggering bantam rooster of a youth, too young and too hot-blooded for Ned’s taste, though a fast friend of Catelyn’s brother, Edmure Tully.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3961" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“即便兰尼斯特的人，也不至于蠢到这种地步。”马柯•派柏爵士斥道。他是个脾气暴躁、有如好斗雄鸡的年轻人。虽然在奈德看来，他历练太浅，又太过血气方刚，但他却是凯特琳的弟弟艾德慕•徒利的好友。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3962');"><p>"Every man among them was mounted and mailed, my lord," Ser Karyl answered calmly. "They were armed with steel-tipped lances and longswords, with battle-axes for the butchering." He gestured toward one of the ragged survivors. "You. Yes, you, no one’s going to hurt you. Tell the Hand what you told me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3962" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，他们个个骑着骏马身披铠甲，”卡列尔爵士冷静地回答，“手中持有精钢长枪和宝剑，还有用来屠杀村民的战斧。”他伸手指指这群衣衫褴褛的幸存者中的一人。“你，对，就是你，说出来没关系，把你跟我说的话都告诉首相大人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3963');"><p>The old man bobbed his head. "Concerning their horses," he said, "it were warhorses they rode. Many a year I worked in old Ser Willum’s stables, so I knows the difference. Not a one of these ever pulled a plow, gods bear witness if I’m wrong."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3963" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老人低下头。“关于他们骑的马，”他说，“他们骑的是战马。我在维伦老爵士的马房里做过很多年，看得出其中差异。他们骑的马没有一匹是犁过田的，我敢以天上诸神之名发誓。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3964');"><p>"Well-mounted brigands," observed Littlefinger. "Perhaps they stole the horses from the last place they raided."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3964" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“骑好马的土匪，”小指头表示意见，“或许马是他们刚从别处抢来的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3965');"><p>"How many men were there in this raiding party?" Ned asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3965" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这群强盗一共有多少人？”奈德问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3966');"><p>"A hundred, at the least," Joss answered, in the same instant as the bandaged smith said, "Fifty," and the grandmother behind him, "Hunnerds and hunnerds, m’lord, an army they was."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3966" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“最起码一百个。”乔斯回答，而在同时，那位包着绷带的铁匠也开了口，“五十个。”他后面的老太婆则说，“好几百人啊，大人，根本就是一支军队。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3967');"><p>"You are more right than you know, goodwoman," Lord Eddard told her. "You say they flew no banners. What of the armor they wore? Did any of you note ornaments or decorations, devices on shield or helm?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3967" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好太太，我相信您说得很正确。”艾德公爵告诉她，“你们说他们没打旗臶，那他们穿的盔甲呢？你们有没有谁注意到上面的花纹或装饰，或者是盾牌和头盔上的家徽？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3968');"><p>The brewer, Joss, shook his head. "It grieves me, m’lord, but no, the armor they showed us was plain, only?.?.?.?the one who led them, he was armored like the rest, but there was no mistaking him all the same. It was the size of him, m’lord. Those as say the giants are all dead never saw this one, I swear. Big as an ox he was, and a voice like stone breaking."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3968" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>酿酒师傅乔斯摇摇头。“大人，有的话那敢情好，可他们穿的盔甲样式都很普通，只有……只有那领头的，他虽然穿得和其他人一样，可您绝不会把他和别人弄混。大人，这家伙块头可真大，俺敢打赌，那些断言巨人已死的人没见过这家伙。他块头大得跟头牛似的，讲起话来声音响得像山石迸裂。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3969');"><p>"The Mountain!" Ser Marq said loudly. "Can any man doubt it? This was Gregor Clegane’s work."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3969" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一定是‘魔山’！”马柯爵士大声说，“这还用问？一定是格雷果•克里冈干的好事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3970');"><p>Ned heard muttering from beneath the windows and the far end of the hall. Even in the galley, nervous whispers were exchanged. High lords and smallfolk alike knew what it could mean if Ser Marq was proved right. Ser Gregor Clegane stood bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3970" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德听见窗户下方和大厅远端窃窃私语声此起彼落，不安的说话声也从外面的走廊传来。在场众人不论贫富贵贱，都清楚倘若马柯爵士所言得到证实，代表着什么：格雷果•克里冈爵士正是泰温•兰尼斯特公爵的封臣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3971');"><p>He studied the frightened faces of the villagers. Small wonder they had been so fearful; they had thought they were being dragged here to name Lord Tywin a red-handed butcher before a king who was his son by marriage. He wondered if the knights had given them a choice.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3971" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他审视着村民惊恐的脸孔，也难怪他们如此害怕，他们起初必定以为自己被拖来这里，要在国王面前指控泰温大人为满手血腥的屠夫——而国王本人正是泰温的女婿。他很怀疑那几位骑士有没有给他们选择的余地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3972');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle rose ponderously from the council table, his chain of office clinking. "Ser Marq, with respect, you cannot know that this outlaw was Ser Gregor. There are many large men in the realm."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3972" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔大学士从议事桌边沉重地站起身，象征职位的项链不住碰撞。“马柯爵士，没有对您不敬的意思，但我们无法就此认定那强盗便是格雷果爵士。国内的大块头大有人在。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3973');"><p>"As large as the Mountain That Rides?" Ser Karyl said. "I have never met one."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3973" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“但有人跟魔山一样吗? ”卡列尔爵士道，“我可从没见过。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3974');"><p>"Nor has any man here," Ser Raymun added hotly. "Even his brother is a pup beside him. My lords, open your eyes. Do you need to see his seal on the corpses? It was Gregor."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3974" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“相信在场也没人见过。”雷蒙爵士愤怒地说，“跟他站在一起，连他弟弟都像只小狗。在座诸君，请睁开您们的眼睛吧，难道你们还需要亲眼见到他的印章盖上尸体才肯相信吗？这一定是格雷果，不会错的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3975');"><p>"Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?" Pycelle asked. "By the grace of his liege lord, he holds a stout keep and lands of his own. The man is an anointed knight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3975" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“然则格雷果爵士何必去打家劫舍？”派席尔问，“靠着他的封君老爷，他不但坐拥坚固堡垒，还有自己的良田领地，此人可是个涂抹圣油，经过正式册封的骑士啊。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3976');"><p>"A false knight!" Ser Marq said. "Lord Tywin’s mad dog."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3976" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这家伙是个虚伪的骑士！”马柯爵士道，“他是泰温大人的疯狗。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3977');"><p>"My lord Hand," Pycelle declared in a stiff voice, "I urge you to remind this good knight that Lord Tywin Lannister is the father of our own gracious queen."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3977" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“首相大人，”派席尔语气僵硬地说，“还请您提醒这位‘正直’的骑士先生，泰温•兰尼斯特大人是我们王后陛下的父亲。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3978');"><p>"Thank you, Grand Maester Pycelle," Ned said. "I fear we might have forgotten that if you had not pointed it out."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3978" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谢谢您，派席尔大学士，”奈德道，“您若不提起，只怕我们都忘了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3979');"><p>From his vantage point atop the throne, he could see men slipping out the door at the far end of the hall. Hares going to ground, he supposed?.?.?.?or rats off to nibble the queen’s cheese. He caught a glimpse of Septa Mordane in the gallery, with his daughter Sansa beside her. Ned felt a flash of anger; this was no place for a girl. But the septa could not have known that today’s court would be anything but the usual tedious business of hearing petitions, settling disputes between rival holdfasts, and adjudicating the placement of boundary stones.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3979" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从高高的王座上，他看到大厅尽头有人溜出去。兔子就这么跑走了，他心想……不，应该说是贪恋王后奶酪的耗子吧。他瞥见茉丹修女带着珊莎站在走廊上，顿时火冒三丈：这不是小女孩该来的地方。但修女事先也不可能料想到今天的会议内容并非繁冗的日常杂务——聆听百姓请愿，调解村镇间纷争，以及判定土地界石划分等等。
