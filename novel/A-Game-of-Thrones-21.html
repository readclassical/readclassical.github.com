</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1698');"><p>Eddard Stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the Red Keep sore, tired, hungry, and irritable. He was still ahorse, dreaming of a long hot soak, a roast fowl, and a featherbed, when the king’s steward told him that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council. The honor of the Hand’s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient. "It will be convenient on the morrow," Ned snapped as he dismounted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1698" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾德•史塔克浑身酸痛，又累又饿，心情恶劣地骑马穿过红堡高耸的青铜大门。御前总管前来通知他派席尔大学士召开紧急的御前会议，希望新任首相方便的话能大驾光临时，他人还在马背上，心里只想好好泡个热水澡，来只烤鸡或烤鸭，然后在羽毛床上睡个觉。“方便的话，改成明天。”奈德下马时没好气地说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1699');"><p>The steward bowed very low. "I shall give the councillors your regrets, my lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1699" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>总管恭敬地一躬到底。“首相大人，那我就转告重臣们，您不便出席。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1700');"><p>"No, damn it," Ned said. It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun. "I will see them. Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1700" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“算了，该死的。”奈德道。还没上任便先把朝廷重臣给全得罪光那怎么成。“我这就去见他们。但请先给我几分钟，容我换上比较正式的服装。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1701');"><p>"Yes, my lord," the steward said. "We have given you Lord Arryn’s former chambers in the Tower of the Hand, if it please you. I shall have your things taken there."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1701" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，大人。”总管说，“我们已经把艾林大人以前在首相塔的房间都给您准备好了，如您愿意，我这就差人把您的东西给送过去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1702');"><p>"My thanks," Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt. The rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him. Ned saw Vayon Poole, his own steward, and called out. "It seems the council has urgent need of me. See that my daughters find their bedchambers, and tell Jory to keep them there. Arya is not to go exploring." Poole bowed. Ned turned back to the royal steward. "My wagons are still straggling through the city. I shall need appropriate garments."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1702" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有劳了。”奈德边说边扯下骑马戴的手套，塞进腰带。身后，他的家人和臣属正陆续进入大门。奈德看到管家维扬•普尔，便叫住他，“看来宫里好像有急事找我。好好安顿我女儿，告诉乔里叫她们待在房里。不准艾莉亚到处乱跑。”普尔欠身。奈德转身对御前总管说：“我的马车还在城里半路上。我需要合适的衣服。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1703');"><p>"It will be my great pleasure," the steward said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1703" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“为您服务是我莫大的荣幸。”总管道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1704');"><p>And so Ned had come striding into the council chambers, bone-tired and dressed in borrowed clothing, to find four members of the small council waiting for him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1704" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，筋疲力尽的奈德，就这么穿着借来的衣服，大步走进议事厅，发现四名重臣正在等他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1705');"><p>The chamber was richly furnished. Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes, and in one corner a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the Summer Isles. The walls were hung with tapestries from Norvos and Qohor and Lys, and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the door, eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1705" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>议事厅的陈舔极为华丽。地板上铺的是密尔地毯，而非灯芯草席。房间一角摆着一幅来自盛夏群岛的木屏风，上面雕刻有上百种栩栩如生、色彩斑斓的珍禽异兽。墙壁上则挂满了诺佛斯、科霍尔和里斯产的精美织锦。门两侧是一对瓦雷利亚的狮身人面兽雕像，圆润的红榴石双眼在黑色大理石的脸上显得炯炯有神。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1706');"><p>The councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment he entered. "Lord Stark, I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad. We have all been visiting the sept to light candles for Prince Joffrey. I pray for his recovery." His hand left powder stains on Ned’s sleeve, and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1706" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德前脚刚踏进房间，几位重臣中他最嫌恶的太监瓦里斯便靠了过来。“史塔克大人，我听说了您在国王大道上遇到的麻烦事儿，真令人遗憾哪。我们都去圣堂为乔佛里王子点了蜡烛，祈祷他早日康复。”他的手在奈德袖子上留下脂粉的痕迹。他浑身散发出腐败的甜腻气息，闻起来活像生在坟墓上的花。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1707');"><p>"Your gods have heard you," Ned replied, cool yet polite. "The prince grows stronger every day." He disentangled himself from the eunuch’s grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the screen, talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger. Renly had been a boy of eight when Robert won the throne, but he had grown into a man so like his brother that Ned found it disconcerting. Whenever he saw him, it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before him, fresh from his victory on the Trident.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1707" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你的神想必听到了你的祷告，”奈德冷淡而有礼地回答，“王子的健康状况已日渐好转。”他从太监掌中抽出手，穿过房间朝蓝礼公爵走去。蓝礼正站在屏风旁，小声地和一名矮个男子交谈，那人必是小指头无疑。劳勃刚夺下王位时，蓝礼不过是个七岁小男生，如今他已长大成人，神貌酷似乃兄，奈德为此觉得极不自在。每次见到他，都仿佛时光倒流，看到那个英气勃发，甫从三叉戟河得胜归来的劳勃站在面前。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1708');"><p>"I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark," Renly said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1708" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“史塔克大人，看来您安然抵达了。”蓝礼道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1709');"><p>"And you as well," Ned replied. "You must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your brother Robert."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1709" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您不也是。”奈德回答，“恕我直言，有时候您和您哥哥劳勃真像一个模子打出来的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1710');"><p>"A poor copy," Renly said with a shrug.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1710" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我哪比得上他。”蓝礼耸耸肩。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1711');"><p>"Though much better dressed," Littlefinger quipped. "Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1711" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您至少穿得比他好。”小指头俏皮地说，“蓝礼大人花在衣服上的钱，宫里的夫人太太恐怕都没几个比得上。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1712');"><p>It was true enough. Lord Renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his doublet. A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder, fastened with an emerald brooch. "There are worse crimes," Renly said with a laugh. "The way you dress, for one."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1712" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>此话倒是不假。蓝礼公爵穿着暗绿天鹅绒紧身衣，上面绣了十二头金色雄鹿。一边肩头潇洒地垂着织金半披风，用一枚翡翠胸针别起。“这应该算不上滔天大罪。”蓝礼笑道，“瞧瞧你穿的什么德行，那才失礼。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1713');"><p>Littlefinger ignored the jibe. He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence. "I have hoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1713" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头不理会他的嘲笑。他嘴角挂着近乎轻慢的微笑看着奈德。“史塔克大人，这些年来我一直想见见您。我想凯特琳夫人应该向您提起过我吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1714');"><p>"She has," Ned replied with a chill in his voice. The sly arrogance of the comment rankled him. "I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1714" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她是提过。”奈德冷冷地答道。对方这句傲慢中带着促狭的话惹恼了他。“如果我没记错的话，你也认识我哥哥布兰登。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1715');"><p>Renly Baratheon laughed. Varys shuffled over to listen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1715" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>蓝礼•拜拉席恩哈哈大笑。瓦里斯则曳步凑来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1716');"><p>"Rather too well," Littlefinger said. "I still carry a token of his esteem. Did Brandon speak of me too?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1716" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我跟他很熟。”小指头道，“至今身上都还留着他的纪念。布兰登也提起过我？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1717');"><p>"Often, and with some heat," Ned said, hoping that would end it. He had no patience with this game they played, this dueling with words.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1717" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“常提起你，多半是火冒三丈的时候。”奈德说，心中希望就此结束这个话题。他对这类文字游戏素无兴趣。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1718');"><p>"I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks," Littlefinger said. "Here in the south, they say you are all made of ice, and melt when you ride below the Neck."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1718" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我还以为你们史塔克家的人没那么大火气，”小指头说，“在我们南方，大家都说你们是冰做的，一过颈泽便要融化。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1719');"><p>"I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish. You may count on it." Ned moved to the council table and said, "Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1719" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“贝里席大人，您大可放心，我并不打算太快融化。”奈德朝会议桌移去。“派席尔师傅，我瞧您身体还很硬朗。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1720');"><p>The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table. "Well enough for a man of my years, my lord," he replied, "yet I do tire easily, I fear." Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face. His maester’s collar was no simple metal choker such as Luwin wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered him from throat to breast. The links were forged of every metal known to man: black iron and red gold, bright copper and dull lead, steel and tin and pale silver, brass and bronze and platinum. Garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork, and here and there an emerald or ruby. "Perhaps we might begin soon," the Grand Maester said, hands knitting together atop his broad stomach. "I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1720" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大学士从他长桌尾端的长椅上抬头，露出微笑。“大人，以我这把年纪，有这样的身体很不错了。”他答道，“啊，只是容易疲劳。”他有张慈蔼的脸，几束白发垂挂在早已秃光的额头两边。他的学士项圈并非鲁温那种简单的金属臸品，而是由二十四种金属片所串成的沉重项链，从喉头一直垂到胸膛。锁链用人类所知的每一种金属打造而成：黑铁和红金，发亮红铜和沉重的铅，精钢、锡和黯淡的白银，黄铜、青铜与白金。石榴石、紫水晶和黑珍珠装饰着金属链，翡翠和红宝石点缀其间。“我们不妨开始罢。”大学士把手放在大肚子上反复揉搓，“再等下去，只怕我就要睡着了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1721');"><p>"As you will." The king’s seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows. Ned took the chair beside it, as the right hand of his king. "My lords," he said formally, "I am sorry to have kept you waiting."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1721" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如您所愿，”国王在会议桌的首位空着，那椅子靠背上用金线绣着拜拉席恩家族的宝冠雄鹿。奈德拣了国王右边，象征国王右手的位子坐下。“诸位大人，”他正色道，“很抱歉让大家久等。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1722');"><p>"You are the King’s Hand," Varys said. "We serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1722" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“史塔克大人，您是国王的首相，”瓦里斯道，“为您效劳就是我们职责所在。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1723');"><p>As the others took their accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here, in this room, with these men. He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell. I am surrounded by flatterers and fools, the king had insisted. Ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools. He thought he knew already. "We are but five," he pointed out.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1723" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>眼看其他人纷纷在自己固有的座位落坐，艾德•史塔克才猛然惊觉此时此地自己是多么格格不入。他忆起劳勃在临冬城墓窖里对他说过的话，我身边净是些白痴和马屁精。奈德朝会议桌看去，暗自揣测哪些是白痴，哪些又是马屁精。答案他已了然于心。“我们只有五人。”他指出。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1724');"><p>"Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north," Varys said, "and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1724" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“国王北行之后没多久，史坦尼斯大人便回了龙石岛。”瓦里斯道，“至于我们英勇的巴利斯坦爵士，此刻无疑正随侍国王身边，护送他穿过城市罢。身为御林铁卫队长，这是他职责所在呢。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1725');"><p>"Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us," Ned suggested.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1725" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“或许我们该等巴利斯坦爵士和陛下加入之后再开始。”奈德提议。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1726');"><p>Renly Baratheon laughed aloud. "If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could be a long sit."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1726" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>蓝礼•拜拉席恩朗声笑道：“要等我老哥赏脸，那不知到何年何月啰。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1727');"><p>"Our good King Robert has many cares," Varys said. "He entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten his load."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1727" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们亲爱的劳勃国王有太多事情需要操心，”瓦里斯说，“所以便将鸡毛蒜皮小事交给我们，以减轻负担。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1728');"><p>"What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears," Lord Renly said, "so it falls to us to govern the realm. He does send us a command from time to time." He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table. "This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at once. He has an urgent task for us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1728" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“瓦里斯大人的意思是说，凡是牵舒财政、农获和律法的事务，我王兄听了就头痛。”蓝礼公爵道，“所以管理国家就落到我们头上了。他倒是不忘记时不时交代些什么下来。”他从袖子里抽出一张裹紧的纸放在桌上。“比如今天早上，他吩咐我提前全速进城，请派席尔大学士立刻召开这次会议。他有项紧急差事交给我们办。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1729');"><p>Littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned. It bore the royal seal. Ned broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king’s urgent command, reading the words with mounting disbelief. Was there no end to Robert’s folly? And to do this in his name, that was salt in the wound. "Gods be good," he swore.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1729" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头微笑着将信笺交给奈德，上面盖了王家印信。奈德用拇指揭开蜡印，摊平信纸，想看看国王的紧急命令究竟是什么。他越读越难以置信，劳勃到底要胡闹到什么地步才罢休？还是以他的名义，这简直是雪上加霜。“天杀的，”他不禁咒道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1730');"><p>"What Lord Eddard means to say," Lord Renly announced, "is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1730" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“奈德大人的意思是说，”蓝礼公爵宣布，“国王陛下指示我们举办一次盛大的比武竞技，以庆祝新首相上任。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1731');"><p>"How much?" asked Littlefinger, mildly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1731" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要花多少钱？”小指头兴趣索然地问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1732');"><p>Ned read the answer off the letter. "Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion. Twenty thousand to the man who comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1732" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德从信上念出答案：“优胜者赏四万金龙币，居次者赏两万金龙币。团体近身战的优胜者也是两万，舐箭优胜则是一万。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1733');"><p>"Ninety thousand gold pieces," Littlefinger sighed. "And we must not neglect the other costs. Robert will want a prodigious feast. That means cooks, carpenters, serving girls, singers, jugglers, fools?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1733" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一共九万金币。”小指头叹道，“还得加上其他开销。想也知道劳勃一定要大宴宾客。也就是说我们需要厨师、木匠、女侍、歌手、戏子伶人和杂耍傻子……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1734');"><p>"Fools we have in plenty," Lord Renly said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1734" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“傻子我们倒是不愁找到。”蓝礼公爵说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1735');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked, "Will the treasury bear the expense?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1735" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔总师看着小指头问：“国库付得出这笔款子？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1736');"><p>"What treasury is that?" Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth. "Spare me the foolishness, Maester. You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years. I shall have to borrow the money. No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating. We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present, what matter another hundred thousand?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1736" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哪来的国库？”小指头撇撇嘴，“大学士您就别装蒜了，你我都很清楚国库已经空了好多年。还不是得伸手借钱，想必兰尼斯特家会很乐意支援。反正咱们已经欠了泰温大人三百多万金龙，再借个几十万算什么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1737');"><p>Ned was stunned. "Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1737" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德震惊无比。“你说王室负债高达 ‘三百万’金币？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1738');"><p>"The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark. The Lannisters are the biggest part of it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading cartels. Of late I’ve had to turn to the Faith. The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1738" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“史塔克大人，此刻王室负债总额超过六百万。兰尼斯特家是最大的债主，但我们也向提利尔大人、布拉佛斯的铁金库，还有好些泰洛西商行借过款。最近我不得不另辟财源，把主意动到了教会头上，总主教大人讨价还价的本领之高，连多恩的鱼贩都比不上。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1739');"><p>Ned was aghast. "Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold. How could you let this happen?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1739" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德简直错愕到无以复加。“伊里斯•坦格利安留下了堆积如山的金银财宝，你怎么会让它沦落到这步田地？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1740');"><p>Littlefinger gave a shrug. "The master of coin finds the money. The king and the Hand spend it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1740" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头耸肩：“财政大臣只管找钱，花钱的是国王和首相。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1741');"><p>"I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm," Ned said hotly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1741" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“琼恩•艾林绝不会允许劳勃这样挥霍。”奈德忿忿地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1742');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head, his chains clinking softly. "Lord Arryn was a prudent man, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1742" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔总师摇摇他那颗光头，项链轻声作响。“艾林大人固然精打细算，但恐怕国王陛下不见得都听从睿臹的谏言。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1743');"><p>"My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts," Renly Baratheon said, "and he loathes what he calls ‘counting coppers.’ "
</p></origin><translate id="div_1743" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我王兄热爱比武竞技和山珍海味，”蓝礼•拜拉席恩道，“他最讨厌所谓的‘数铜板’。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1744');"><p>"I will speak with His Grace," Ned said. "This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1744" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我会跟陛下谈谈，”奈德说，“这么铺张浪费的比赛，国家可负担不起。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1745');"><p>"Speak to him as you will," Lord Renly said, "we had still best make our plans."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1745" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“跟他谈谈当然很好，”蓝礼公爵道，“不过我们还是先着手订个计划吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1746');"><p>"Another day," Ned said. Perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him. He would have to remember that he was no longer in Winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, he was but first among equals. "Forgive me, my lords," he said in a softer tone. "I am tired. Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher." He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them all, and made for the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1746" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“改天再议。”奈德说。从他们的眼神看来，他的口气似乎太尖锐了点。要想治理，他就必须牢记，自己已不是临冬城万人之上的领主身份，在这里他不过是地位平等的重臣之首罢了。“诸位大人，请原谅我。”他改用较和缓的口气，“我实在是累了。我们今天就到此为止，等我精神好些时再继续。”说完他没有征求其他人同意，便突然站起身，朝在座的重臣一一点头后，径自离开。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1747');"><p>Outside, wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates, and the yard was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men. The king had not yet arrived, he was told. Since the ugliness on the Trident, the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate themselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension. Robert had hardly been seen; the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. If so, he might be hours behind, but he would still be here too soon for Ned’s liking. He had only to look at Sansa’s face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again. The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery. Sansa blamed Arya and told her that it should have been Nymeria who died. And Arya was lost after she heard what had happened to her butcher’s boy. Sansa cried herself to sleep, Arya brooded silently all day long, and Eddard Stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1777');"><p>Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand. "This blade was sent to open Bran’s throat and spill his life’s blood."

And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand. Bran’s wolf had saved the boy’s life, he thought dully. What was it that Jon had said when they found the pups in the snow? Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord. And he had killed Sansa’s, and for what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent these wolves, what folly had he done?

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1781');"><p>Painfully, Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant. "The Imp’s dagger," he repeated. It made no sense. His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt, and he slammed the blade into the table, felt it bite into the wood. It stood mocking him. "Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead? The boy has never done him harm."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1781" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德痛苦地强迫自己将思绪拉回眼前的匕首，思考隐含其后的含义。“小恶魔的刀。”他复诵。这太不合理。他紧握平滑的龙骨刀柄，将之狠狠地插进桌面，感觉它深深地咬入木头。匕首就这么立着，仿佛在嘲弄他。“提利昂•兰尼斯特为什么要布兰的命？那孩子从没招惹他。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1782');"><p>"Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?" Littlefinger asked. "The Imp would never have acted alone."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1782" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们史塔克家的人都没脑筋的？”小指头问，“小恶魔当然不会单独行动。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1783');"><p>Ned rose and paced the length of the room. "If the queen had a role in this or, gods forbid, the king himself?.?.?.?no, I will not believe that." Yet even as he said the words, he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and Robert’s talk of sending hired knives after the Targaryen princess. He remembered Rhaegar’s infant son, the red ruin of his skull, and the way the king had turned away, as he had turned away in Darry’s audience hall not so long ago. He could still hear Sansa pleading, as Lyanna had pleaded once.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1783" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德起身，绕着房间踱步。“难道说王后亦参与此事？或者，诸神在上，连国王他也……不，绝对不可能。”他一边说着，一边想起了那个荒冢地的清冷早晨，劳勃提到派刺客去对付坦格利安公主。他忆起雷加那尚在襁褓的儿子，血淋淋的头颅，以及国王置之不理的态度，正如不久以前他在戴瑞的会客厅里的所作所为。珊莎的哀告至今犹在耳际，一如莱安娜临终前的恳求。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1784');"><p>"Most likely the king did not know," Littlefinger said. "It would not be the first time. Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1785');"><p>Ned had no reply for that. The face of the butcher’s boy swam up before his eyes, cloven almost in two, and afterward the king had said not a word. His head was pounding.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1785" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德没有答话。屠夫小弟的那张几乎被劈成两半的脸浮现在他眼前，然而国王半声也没吭。他的脑袋开始轰轰作响。

Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth. The queen?.?.?.?if you can find proof, and if you can make Robert listen, then perhaps?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1786" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头晃到桌边，把匕首从木头里拔出。“无论怎样行动，都构成叛国罪。若是控告国王，只怕你话还没出口就先被伊林•派恩给宰了。若是王后……除非你能找到证据，而且能让劳勃听进去，才有可能……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1787');"><p>"We have proof," Ned said. "We have the dagger."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1788');"><p>"This?" Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end. "A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, my lord. The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with his hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?" He tossed the knife lightly to Ned. "My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1788" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这个？”小指头漫不经心地把玩着匕首。“大人，这是把好刀，好刀都是两面开刃的。小恶魔肯定会辩称匕首是他在临冬城期间弄丢或是被偷。既然他雇的杀手已死，谁能证明他所言真假呢？”他把刀子轻轻抛给奈德。“我建议你还是把这玩意儿丢进河里，当它根本就不存在罢。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1789');"><p>Ned regarded him coldly. "Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell. My son lies crippled, perhaps dying.

A fool’s task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife anything."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1797');"><p>"It is more than that," Catelyn insisted. "Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aron Santagar in all secrecy, yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation. I fear that man."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1797" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不只如此，”凯特琳坚持，“罗德利克爵士和艾伦•桑塔加爵士的会面自始至终都秘密进行，但这蜘蛛不知怎么就是知道谈话内容。我很怕这个人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1798');"><p>Littlefinger smiled. "Leave Lord Varys to me, sweet lady. If you will permit me a small obscenity, and where better for it, I hold the man’s balls in the palm of my hand." He cupped his fingers, smiling. "Or would, if he were a man, or had any balls. You see, if the pie is opened, the birds begin to sing, and Varys would not like that. Were I you, I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1798" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头微笑。“好夫人，瓦里斯伯爵就交给我来对付。容我说几句脏话——还有什么地方比这里更适合了呢？——他的卵蛋被我大大方方地捏在手掌心。”他合拢指头，笑了，“当然啰，这里假舔他是个有卵蛋的男人。你不妨这么想，假如喜鹊会开口，小小鸟儿要歌唱，那么瓦里斯是不会喜欢的。好啦，如果我是你，与其担心那太监，不如多提防兰尼斯特的人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1799');"><p>Ned did not need Littlefinger to tell him that. He was thinking back to the day Arya had been found, to the look on the queen’s face when she said, We have a wolf, so soft and quiet. He was thinking of the boy Mycah, of Jon Arryn’s sudden death, of Bran’s fall, of old mad Aerys Targaryen dying on the floor of his throne room while his life’s blood dried on a golden blade. "My lady," he said, turning to Catelyn, "there is nothing more you can do here. I want you to return to Winterfell at once. If there was one assassin, there could be others. Whoever ordered Bran’s death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1799" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德无需小指头提醒。他想起找到艾莉亚那天的场景，想起王后当时的神情。谁说我们没有狼？那么地轻声细语。他想到男孩米凯，想到琼恩•艾林的猝死，还有布兰坠楼，以及丧心病狂的老王伊里斯•坦格利安躺在王座厅的地板上奄奄一息，他的血在镀金宝剑上慢慢干涸的场面。 “夫人，”他转向凯特琳，“你留在这里也无济于事，我希望你即刻返回临冬城。所谓有其一必有其二，难保以后不会有其他刺客上门滋事。不管背后主谋是谁，他一定很快就得知布兰活了下来。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1800');"><p>"I had hoped to see the girls?.?.?.?" Catelyn said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1800" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我本想见见女儿……”凯特琳道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1801');"><p>"That would be most unwise," Littlefinger put in. "The Red Keep is full of curious eyes, and children talk."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1801" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那就太不明臹了。”小指头插话。“红堡处处隔墙有耳，更何况小孩子口风不紧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1802');"><p>"He speaks truly, my love," Ned told her. He embraced her. "Take Ser Rodrik and ride for Winterfell. I will watch over the girls. Go home to our sons and keep them safe."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1802" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“亲爱的，他说得有理。”奈德告诉她，一边给她拥抱。“带上罗德利克爵士，启程回临冬城去罢。我会好好照顾女儿们。回到我们的儿子身边，保护好他们。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1803');"><p>"As you say, my lord." Catelyn lifted her face, and Ned kissed her. Her maimed fingers clutched against his back with a desperate strength, as if to hold him safe forever in the shelter of her arms. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1803" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那就这样，大人”凯特琳抬起脸，奈德吻了她。她受伤的手用一种近乎绝望的力量环抱住他的背，仿佛要将他永远留在自己安全的怀抱里。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1804');"><p>"Would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber?" asked Littlefinger. "I should warn you, Stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1804" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“老爷、夫人莫不借卧室一用？”小指头问，“不过我先提醒你，史塔克，在这儿开房办事是要收费的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1805');"><p>"A moment alone, that’s all I ask," Catelyn said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1805" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“让我们独处一下就好。”凯特琳道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1806');"><p>"Very well." Littlefinger strolled to the door. "Don’t be too long. It is past time the Hand and I returned to the castle, before our absence is noted."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1806" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“也罢。”小指头朝门边走去。“别拖太久。我和首相大人早该回到城里，以免失踪太久他人起疑。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1807');"><p>Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own. "I will not forget the help you gave me, Petyr. When your men came for me, I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy. I have found you more than a friend. I have found a brother I’d thought lost."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1807" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳走到他身边握住他的手。“培提尔，我永远不会忘记你的帮助。你手下来找我的时候，我原不知自己将落入朋友还是敌人的手中。结果我发现你不仅是朋友，还是我失散多年的弟弟。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1808');"><p>Petyr Baelish smiled. "I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell anyone. I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1808" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>培提尔•贝里席微笑道：“好夫人，我这人就是多愁善感，这话还请你千万别告诉他人。这些年来我在宫廷里费尽心力，想让别人以为我是个既邪恶又残酷的人，实在不愿就这么功亏一篑。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1809');"><p>Ned believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, "You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1809" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这番话奈德是一个字也不信，但他还是彬彬有礼地说：“贝里席大人，我也感谢您。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1810');"><p>"Oh, now there’s a treasure," Littlefinger said, exiting.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1810" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哟，这可是东洋宝贝。”小指头说着离开房间。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1811');"><p>When the door had closed behind him, Ned turned back to his wife. "Once you are home, send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal. They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin. Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army. Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are well manned. And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy. If there is war, we shall have sore need of his father’s fleet."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1811" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>房门关上后，奈德转身面对他的妻子。“你一到家，立刻以我的名义送信给赫曼•陶哈和盖伯特•葛洛佛，命令他们各调一百名弓箭手协防卡林湾。两百弓箭手足以阻挡任何军队北上颈泽。指示曼德勒伯爵加紧维修白港的防御工事，并确保守军充足。还有，从今往后，我希望你特别看紧席恩•葛雷乔伊。倘若战争爆发，我们非常需要他父亲的舰队。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1812');"><p>"War?" The fear was plain on Catelyn’s face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1812" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“战争爆发？”恐惧清楚地写在凯特琳脸上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1813');"><p>"It will not come to that," Ned promised her, praying it was true. He took her in his arms again. "The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow, but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not have. I must play out this fool’s masquerade as if nothing is amiss. Remember why I came here, my love. If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1813" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“情势不致恶化到那个地步的。”奈德向她保证，心中暗自祈祷真是如此。他再度搂她入怀。 “兰尼斯特家对待弱者毫不留情，伊里斯•坦格利安就是最好的教训。然而除非他们有全国的军力作后盾，否则决不敢进犯北方，而他们作梦也别想有那样的一天。我必须玩这场愚人的假面舞会，继续装出若无其事的样子。记得我来此的目的么，亲爱的？我要找出兰尼斯特家谋杀琼恩•艾林的证据……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1814');"><p>He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms. Her scarred hands clung to him. "If," she said, "what then, my love?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1814" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他感觉到凯特琳在他怀里颤抖，她伤残的手紧紧抱住他。“若真找到了，”她说，“接下来怎么办，亲爱的？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1815');"><p>That was the most dangerous part, Ned knew. "All justice flows from the king," he told her. "When I know the truth, I must go to Robert." And pray that he is the man I think he is, he finished silently, and not the man I fear he has become.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1815" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接下来是最危险的部分，奈德明白。“国王乃是至高的法律仲裁，”他告诉她，“待我查明真相，我将觐见劳勃。”届时我只能祈祷他仍保有意想中的英明，而非我所恐惧的昏庸，他在心里默默地说完。
