</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_612');"><p>Since morning Zoe had delivered up the flat to a managing man who had come from Brebant's with a staff of helpers and waiters. Brebant was to supply everything, from the supper, the plates and dishes, the glass, the linen, the flowers, down to the seats and footstools. Nana could not have mustered a dozen napkins out of all her cupboards, and not having had time to get a proper outfit after her new start in life and scorning to go to the restaurant, she had decided to make the restaurant come to her. It struck her as being more the thing. She wanted to celebrate her great success as an actress with a supper which should set people talking. As her dining room was too small, the manager had arranged the table in the drawing room, a table with twenty-five covers, placed somewhat close together.
</p></origin><translate id="div_612" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从早上起，佐爱就把整个套间交给一个大饭店的侍应部的领班去布置，他是布雷邦饭店派来的，还带来一班助手和侍者。由布雷邦饭店提供一切：夜宵，餐具，水晶玻璃杯，餐巾，台布，鲜花，甚至还包括椅子和圆凳。娜娜的橱子里，几乎连一打餐巾也没有，在她初次登台演出成功后，还没有来得及配齐各种用品，但她又不屑于到饭店去请客，宁愿把饭店搬到自己家里。这样在她看来似乎显得别具风味。她想用夜宵来庆祝她作为明星的巨大成功，好让世人今后传为佳话。由于她的餐厅太小，侍应部领班就把饭桌摆到客厅里，桌子上摆了二十五套餐具，未免显得挤了一点。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_613');"><p>"Is everything ready?" asked Nana when she returned at midnight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_613" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一切都准备好了吗？”娜娜半夜回到家里，问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_614');"><p>"Oh! I don't know," replied Zoe roughly, looking beside herself with worry. "The Lord be thanked, I don't bother about anything. They're making a fearful mess in the kitchen and all over the flat! I've had to fight my battles too. The other two came again. My eye! I did just chuck 'em out!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_614" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！我不知道，”佐爱语气似乎很恼火，生硬地回答，“谢天谢地，我什么也不管了。他们把厨房和整个房子搞得天翻地覆……见此情景，逼得我和他们吵了一架。另外，那两个老家伙又来了。说实话，我把他们撵走了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_615');"><p>She referred, of course, to her employer's old admirers, the tradesman and the Walachian, to whom Nana, sure of her future and longing to shed her skin, as she phrased it, had decided to give the go-by.
</p></origin><translate id="div_615" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佐爱说的老家伙是过去供养娜娜的两位先生，一个是商人，另一个是瓦拉几亚①人。娜娜早已决定把他们打发走，因为她对自己的未来已经有了信心，又如她说的，她想改邪归正了。  
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_616');"><p>"There are a couple of leeches for you!" she muttered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_616" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“两个厚脸皮家伙！”她嘟哝道，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_617');"><p>"If they come back threaten to go to the police."
</p></origin><translate id="div_617" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果他们再来，你要吓唬吓唬他们，就说去报告警察局。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_618');"><p>Then she called Daguenet and Georges, who had remained behind in the anteroom, where they were hanging up their overcoats. They had both met at the stage door in the Passage des Panoramas, and she had brought them home with her in a cab. As there was nobody there yet, she shouted to them to come into the dressing room while Zoe was touching up her toilet. Hurriedly and without changing her dress she had her hair done up and stuck white roses in her chignon and at her bosom. The little room was littered with the drawing-room furniture, which the workmen had been compelled to roll in there, and it was full of a motley assemblage of round tables, sofas and armchairs, with their legs in air for the most part. Nana was quite ready when her dress caught on a castor and tore upward. At this she swore furiously; such things only happened to her! Ragingly she took off her dress, a very simple affair of white foulard, of so thin and supple a texture that it clung about her like a long shift. But she put it on again directly, for she could not find another to her taste, and with tears in her eyes declared that she was dressed like a ragpicker. Daguenet and Georges had to patch up the rent with pins, while Zoe once more arranged her hair. All three hurried round her, especially the boy, who knelt on the floor with his hands among her skirts. And at last she calmed down again when Daguenet assured her it could not be later than a quarter past twelve, seeing that by dint of scamping her words and skipping her lines she had effectually shortened the third act of the Blonde Venus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_618" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，她去叫达盖内和乔治，他们落在两个老家伙的后面，还在候见厅里挂外套。他们两人都是在全景胡同的演员出口处被她碰见的，于是，她就叫出租马车把他们一起带来了。由于还没有一个客人到，她便叫他们到梳妆室里，这会儿，佐爱正在准备给她梳妆打扮。娜娜的连衣裙也没换，便匆匆忙忙撩起头发，把几朵白玫瑰别在发髻上和胸衣上。梳妆室里塞满了从客厅里搬过来的家具，那是不得已才搬过来的。几张独脚小圆桌，几张长沙发，几把扶手椅，全都四脚朝天，堆在一起。她刚匆匆打扮完，裙子就钩在一件家具的小脚轮上，撕了一道口子。于是，她发火了，破口骂起来；这倒霉事情偏偏都碰上她。她气乎乎的，把连衣裙脱了，那是一件白绸缎裙，款式很简单，既软又薄，穿在身上就像穿着一件长衬衫。可是，马上她又穿上它，因为她找不出其它更合她口味的裙子。她气得几乎哭起来，说自己像个捡破烂的女人。达盖内和乔治不得不用别针把那道口子别起来，佐爱则给她梳头，他们三个人在她身边忙得团团转，尤其是小家伙乔治，他跪在地上，把两只手插在她的裙子里。达盖内安慰她说，由于她省略了许多台词，跳过了一些唱段，草率演完了《金发爱神》的第三幕，所以现在时间最多才午夜过了一刻，这时她才平静下来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_619');"><p>"The play's still far too good for that crowd of idiots," she said. "Did you see? There were thousands there tonight. Zoe, my girl, you will wait in here. Don't go to bed, I shall want you. By gum, it is time they came. Here's company!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_619" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对这一群群傻瓜来说，演得算是太好了，”她说道，“你看见了吗？今天晚上这样的人不算少！……佐爱，我的姑娘，你呆在这里，别去睡觉，我可能还需要你……哎哟！时间到了，已经有人来了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_620');"><p>She ran off while Georges stayed where he was with the skirts of his coat brushing the floor. He blushed, seeing Daguenet looking at him. Notwithstanding which, they had conceived a tender regard the one for the other. They rearranged the bows of their cravats in front of the big dressing glass and gave each other a mutual dose of the clothesbrush, for they were all white from their close contact with Nana.
</p></origin><translate id="div_620" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她走了出去，乔治还跪在地上，他的衣服的底摆拖在地板上。他看见达盖内在注视着他，霎时脸变得通红。不过，他们却彼此生了友情。他们站在一面大穿衣镜前，把领带再结结好，互相刷掉对方从娜娜那里沾上的白粉。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_621');"><p>"One would think it was sugar," murmured Georges, giggling like a greedy little child.
</p></origin><translate id="div_621" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“人家还会说这是白糖哩。”乔治嘟囔道，笑得像个贪食的婴儿。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_622');"><p>A footman hired for the evening was ushering the guests into the small drawing room, a narrow slip of a place in which only four armchairs had been left in order the better to pack in the company. From the large drawing room beyond came a sound as of the moving of plates and silver, while a clear and brilliant ray of light shone from under the door. At her entrance Nana found Clarisse Besnus, whom La Faloise had brought, already installed in one of the armchairs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_622" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那天晚上临时雇来的听差，把客人们领到小客厅里，客厅很小，仅有四把扶手椅没搬走，以便容纳更多一些客人。从旁边的大客厅里，传来了摆放碗碟和银餐具的声音，门底下的缝里透出来一道强烈的光线。娜娜刚进门，就发现克拉利瑟贝尼已经坐在一把扶手椅上，她是拉法卢瓦兹带来的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_623');"><p>"Dear me, you're the first of 'em!" said Nana, who, now that she was successful, treated her familiarly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_623" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哟，你是头一个！”娜娜说道，自从她演出获得成功后，对克拉利瑟亲热起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_624');"><p>"Oh, it's his doing," replied Clarisse. "He's always afraid of not getting anywhere in time. If I'd taken him at his word I shouldn't have waited to take off my paint and my wig."
</p></origin><translate id="div_624" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嘿！就怪他，”克拉利瑟回答，“他总是怕迟到……如果全听他的话，我不等卸装就来了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_625');"><p>The young man, who now saw Nana for the first time, bowed, paid her a compliment and spoke of his cousin, hiding his agitation behind an exaggeration of politeness. But Nana, neither listening to him nor recognizing his face, shook hands with him and then went briskly toward Rose Mignon, with whom she at once assumed a most distinguished manner.
</p></origin><translate id="div_625" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>拉法卢瓦兹是头一次见到娜娜，他对她鞠个躬，并说了一番客套话，接着，他谈起自己的表哥，由于他十分彬彬有礼，内心的不安丝毫没有流露出来。但是，娜娜根本不听他讲话，由于不认识他，只同他握握手，就很快向罗丝米尼翁走去。顿时她显得高贵起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_626');"><p>"Ah, how nice of you, my dear madame! I was so anxious to have you here!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_626" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！亲爱的太太，你真赏脸！……我多么盼望你光临呀！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_627');"><p>"It's I who am charmed, I assure you," said Rose with equal amiability.
</p></origin><translate id="div_627" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我跟你说真话，高兴的应该是我。”罗丝说道，态度也非常亲热。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_628');"><p>"Pray, sit down. Do you require anything?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_628" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“请坐吧……你需要什么吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_629');"><p>"Thank you, no! Ah yes, I've left my fan in my pelisse, Steiner; just look in the right-hand pocket."
</p></origin><translate id="div_629" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不需要什么，谢谢……啊！我把扇子忘记在皮大衣里了。 斯泰内，你去看看右边口袋里有没有。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_630');"><p>Steiner and Mignon had come in behind Rose. The banker turned back and reappeared with the fan while Mignon embraced Nana fraternally and forced Rose to do so also. Did they not all belong to the same family in the theatrical world? Then he winked as though to encourage Steiner, but the latter was disconcerted by Rose's clear gaze and contented himself by kissing Nana's hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_630" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>斯泰内和米尼翁是跟在罗丝后面进来的。银行家转身出去，不一会儿，他拿着扇子回来了。此刻，米尼翁正亲密地拥抱娜娜，并一定要罗丝也去拥抱娜娜。说到底，到了戏院里，大家还不都是一家人吗？随后，他眨眨眼睛，似乎在鼓励斯泰内也同他一样做；但是罗丝用炯炯的目光瞟瞟斯泰内，他心里有点发慌，只在娜娜的手上吻了一下。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_631');"><p>Just then the Count de Vandeuvres made his appearance with Blanche de Sivry. There was an interchange of profound bows, and Nana with the utmost ceremony conducted Blanche to an armchair. Meanwhile Vandeuvres told them laughingly that Fauchery was engaged in a dispute at the foot of the stairs because the porter had refused to allow Lucy Stewart's carriage to come in at the gate. They could hear Lucy telling the porter he was a dirty blackguard in the anteroom. But when the footman had opened the door she came forward with her laughing grace of manner, announced her name herself, took both Nana's hands in hers and told her that she had liked her from the very first and considered her talent splendid. Nana, puffed up by her novel role of hostess, thanked her and was veritably confused. Nevertheless, from the moment of Fauchery's arrival she appeared preoccupied, and directly she could get near him she asked him in a low voice:
</p></origin><translate id="div_631" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在这时，旺德夫尔伯爵与布朗瑟德西弗里来了。彼此都恭恭敬敬地行了礼。娜娜显得非常客气，把布朗瑟带到一张扶手椅那里坐下来。与此同时，旺德夫尔笑着对大家说，福什利正在楼下与人吵架，因为门房不让吕西斯图华的马车进来。人们听见吕西在候见室里骂门房是个没有教养的贱货。可是，等到听差把门一打开，她便笑眯眯地走进来，一边拉拉娜娜的手，一边作自我介绍，说她第一次见到娜娜就喜欢她了，并说娜娜有值得自豪的天才。娜娜第一次充当东道主，心里挺高兴的，感谢他们光临，但确实有些不好意思，福什利来到后，她仿佛有些惶惶不安。她一走到他面前，便悄悄问道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_632');"><p>"Will he come?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_632" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他还来吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_633');"><p>"No, he did not want to," was the journalist's abrupt reply, for he was taken by surprise, though he had got ready some sort of tale to explain Count Muffat's refusal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_633" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，他不愿来。”记者唐突回答道，虽然他事先编了一段话，准备解释缪法伯爵不来的原因，但被她突如其来一问，一时却说不出话来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_634');"><p>Seeing the young woman's sudden pallor, he became conscious of his folly and tried to retract his words.
</p></origin><translate id="div_634" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他见娜娜的脸色一下变得刷白，意识到自己说了傻话，于是竭力想纠正刚才说的话。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_635');"><p>"He was unable to; he is taking the countess to the ball at the Ministry of the Interior tonight."
</p></origin><translate id="div_635" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他来不了啦，今晚他要带伯爵夫人去参加内务部举办的舞会。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_636');"><p>"All right," murmured Nana, who suspected him of ill will, "you'll pay me out for that, my pippin."
</p></origin><translate id="div_636" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好吧，”娜娜喃喃说道，她怀疑福什利办事不尽力，“我以后要跟你算这笔帐，我的小宝贝。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_637');"><p>---Missing---
</p></origin><translate id="div_637" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！随你说吧，”福什利接着说，这种威胁刺伤了他的心，“我不喜欢于这类差使，你去找拉博德特干吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_638');"><p>She turned on her heel, and so did he; they were angry. Just then Mignon was pushing Steiner up against Nana, and when Fauchery had left her he said to her in a low voice and with the good-natured cynicism of a comrade in arms who wishes his friends to be happy:
</p></origin><translate id="div_638" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们两个人都气得转过身子。就在这时候，米尼翁把斯泰内推到娜娜旁边。等到娜娜旁边没人时，米尼翁就悄悄对娜娜说，他是在为朋友寻找乐趣，说话时露出天真无邪、恬不知耻的神态。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_639');"><p>"He's dying of it, you know, only he's afraid of my wife. Won't you protect him?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_639" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你知道，他快想死啦……不过，他怕我老婆。你会保护他的，不是吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_640');"><p>Nana did not appear to understand. She smiled and looked at Rose, the husband and the banker and finally said to the latter:
</p></origin><translate id="div_640" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜的表情像没有听懂他的话。她嘴角上挂着微笑，瞧着罗丝、她的丈夫和银行家。接着，她对银行家说： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_641');"><p>"Monsieur Steiner, you will sit next to me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_641" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“斯泰内先生，等会你坐到我身边来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_642');"><p>With that there came from the anteroom a sound of laughter and whispering and a burst of merry, chattering voices, which sounded as if a runaway convent were on the premises. And Labordette appeared, towing five women in his rear, his boarding school, as Lucy Stewart cruelly phrased it. There was Gaga, majestic in a blue velvet dress which was too tight for her, and Caroline Hequet, clad as usual in ribbed black silk, trimmed with Chantilly lace. Lea de Horn came next, terribly dressed up, as her wont was, and after her the big Tatan Nene, a good-humored fair girl with the bosom of a wet nurse, at which people laughed, and finally little Maria Blond, a young damsel of fifteen, as thin and vicious as a street child, yet on the high road to success, owing to her recent first appearance at the Folies. Labordette had brought the whole collection in a single fly, and they were still laughing at the way they had been squeezed with Maria Blond on her knees. But on entering the room they pursed up their lips, and all grew very conventional as they shook hands and exchanged salutations. Gaga even affected the infantile and lisped through excess of genteel deportment. Tatan Nene alone transgressed. They had been telling her as they came along that six absolutely naked Negroes would serve up Nana's supper, and she now grew anxious about them and asked to see them. Labordette called her a goose and besought her to be silent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_642" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>候见厅里传来了笑声、窃窃私语声和一阵阵快乐谈话声，好像一所修道院女子寄宿学校的女生都逃到了那里。拉博德特来了，他的后边跟着五个女人，用吕西斯图华的挖苦话来说，就是他的全体寄宿女生都来了。她们当中有加加，她穿着蓝色天鹅绒长裙，裙子紧紧裹在身上，神态很庄重；有卡罗利娜埃凯，她总是穿着一件镶着尚蒂伊网眼花边的黑缎裙；有莱娅德霍恩，她像平常一样，身上穿得怪模怪样的；有胖子塔唐内内，她是一个善良的金发女郎，胸部发达得像个奶娘，人们常常嘲笑她；最后是玛丽亚布隆，她是一个十五岁的女孩，长得很瘦，脾气很坏，像个小淘气鬼，是游艺剧院初次登台的明星。拉博德特让她们同乘一辆马车；她们还笑刚才在马车里拥挤的那番情景，玛丽亚布隆被挤得坐在别人的腿上。但是她们见了娜娜，个个抿紧嘴唇，互相握手，互相行礼，大家都显得举止得体。加加装作一副孩子模样，由于她太矫揉造作，说话连字都吐不清楚。只有塔唐内内感到怏怏不乐，因为在路上时，有人告诉她，六个一丝不挂的黑人在为娜娜侍候夜宵，她要求见见这些黑人，但拉博德特说她是笨蛋，叫她住嘴。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_643');"><p>"And Bordenave?" asked Fauchery.
</p></origin><translate id="div_643" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“博尔德纳夫呢？”福什利问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_644');"><p>"Oh, you may imagine how miserable I am," cried Nana; "he won't be able to join us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_644" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“唉！你想象得出我多么遗憾，”娜娜嚷道，“他不能来参加我们的活动了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_645');"><p>"Yes," said Rose Mignon, "his foot caught in a trap door, and he's got a fearful sprain. If only you could hear him swearing, with his leg tied up and laid out on a chair!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_645" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，”罗丝米尼翁说道，“他的脚踩到舞台地板上的一个活板门里，扭伤得很厉害……如果你们看见他那副样子，一条腿绑着，伸在椅子上！嘴里骂这骂那！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_646');"><p>Thereupon everybody mourned over Bordenave's absence. No one ever gave a good supper without Bordenave. Ah well, they would try and do without him, and they were already talking about other matters when a burly voice was heard:
</p></origin><translate id="div_646" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是，大家为博尔德纳夫的缺席而遗憾。他不来，夜宵就像少了什么。末了，大家尽量不谈他了。大家换了话题，这时，听见一个粗大的声音叫道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_647');"><p>"What, eh, what? Is that the way they're going to write my obituary notice?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_647" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“什么！什么！你们就这样把我埋葬掉！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_648');"><p>There was a shout, and all heads were turned round, for it was indeed Bordenave. Huge and fiery-faced, he was standing with his stiff leg in the doorway, leaning for support on Simonne Cabiroche's shoulder. Simonne was for the time being his mistress. This little creature had had a certain amount of education and could play the piano and talk English. She was a blonde on a tiny, pretty scale and so delicately formed that she seemed to bend under Bordenave's rude weight. Yet she was smilingly submissive withal. He postured there for some moments, for he felt that together they formed a tableau.
</p></origin><translate id="div_648" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，听见一声叫声，大家掉头一看，原来是身材魁梧的博尔德纳夫。他脸色通红，一条腿直挺挺的，站在门口，倚在西蒙娜卡比罗什的肩上。现在，西蒙娜与他同居了。这个小女孩受过教育，会弹钢琴，会讲英语，头发金黄，娇小可爱，体质十分娇弱，博尔德纳夫身体沉重，把她压弯了腰，不过，她还是笑吟吟的，一副乖顺的样子。博尔德纳夫觉得他俩成了大家欣赏的镜头，便摆开姿势在那里索性呆了一会儿。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_649');"><p>"One can't help liking ye, eh?" he continued. "Zounds, I was afraid I should get bored, and I said to myself, 'Here goes.'"
</p></origin><translate id="div_649" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯？不管怎样，还得喜欢你们，”他继续说道，“我怕闷得慌，便对自己说：还是去吧……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_650');"><p>But he interrupted himself with an oath.
</p></origin><translate id="div_650" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他说到这里停下来，骂了一句： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_651');"><p>"Oh, damn!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_651" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他妈的！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_652');"><p>Simonne had taken a step too quickly forward, and his foot had just felt his full weight. He gave her a rough push, but she, still smiling away and ducking her pretty head as some animal might that is afraid of a beating, held him up with all the strength a little plump blonde can command. Amid all these exclamations there was a rush to his assistance. Nana and Rose Mignon rolled up an armchair, into which Bordenave let himself sink, while the other women slid a second one under his leg. And with that all the actresses present kissed him as a matter of course. He kept grumbling and gasping.
</p></origin><translate id="div_652" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西蒙娜一步迈得太快，不小心碰到他那只受伤的脚上。他把她猛一推。她仍然满脸笑容，低下她那娇美的脸庞，活像一头挨打的牲口。她使出一个娇小、胖乎乎的金发女郎的全部力量来搀扶他。在一片欢呼声中，大伙都匆匆忙忙走过来帮忙。娜娜和米尼翁推来一张扶手椅，博尔德纳夫一屁股坐下去，其他女人又推过来一张扶手椅，让他搁脚。在场全体女演员自然都一个个过来吻他。他还在唉声叹气，低声埋怨。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_653');"><p>"Oh, damn! Oh, damn! Ah well, the stomach's unhurt, you'll see."
</p></origin><translate id="div_653" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他妈的！他妈的！……不过，我的肠胃总还算好，你们等着瞧吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_654');"><p>Other guests had arrived by this time, and motion became impossible in the room. The noise of clinking plates and silver had ceased, and now a dispute was heard going on in the big drawing room, where the voice of the manager grumbled angrily. Nana was growing impatient, for she expected no more invited guests and wondered why they did not bring in supper. She had just sent Georges to find out what was going on when, to her great surprise, she noticed the arrival of more guests, both male and female. She did not know them in the least. Whereupon with some embarrassment she questioned Bordenave, Mignon and Labordette about them. They did not know them any more than she did, but when she turned to the Count de Vandeuvres he seemed suddenly to recollect himself. They were the young men he had pressed into her service at Count Muffat's. Nana thanked him. That was capital, capital! Only they would all be terribly crowded, and she begged Labordette to go and have seven more covers set. Scarcely had he left the room than the footman ushered in three newcomers. Nay, this time the thing was becoming ridiculous; one certainly could never take them all in. Nana was beginning to grow angry and in her haughtiest manner announced that such conduct was scarcely in good taste. But seeing two more arrive, she began laughing; it was really too funny. So much the worse. People would have to fit in anyhow! The company were all on their feet save Gaga and Rose and Bordenave, who alone took up two armchairs. There was a buzz of voices, people talking in low tones and stifling slight yawns the while.

Doubtless there was a guest missing whom she did not mention. It was a case of waiting. But a minute or two later the company noticed in their midst a tall gentleman with a fine face and a beautiful white beard. The most astonishing thing about it was that nobody had seen him come in; indeed, he must have slipped into the little drawing room through the bedroom door, which had remained ajar. Silence reigned, broken only by a sound of whispering. The Count de Vandeuvres certainly knew who the gentleman was, for they both exchanged a discreet handgrip, but to the questions which the women asked him he replied by a smile only. Thereupon Caroline Hequet wagered in a low voice that it was an English lord who was on the eve of returning to London to be married. She knew him quite well—she had had him. And this account of the matter went the round of the ladies present, Maria Blond alone asserting that, for her part, she recognized a German ambassador. She could prove it, because he often passed the night with one of her friends. Among the men his measure was taken in a few rapid phrases. A real swell, to judge by his looks! Perhaps he would pay for the supper! Most likely. It looked like it. Bah! Provided only the supper was a good one! In the end the company remained undecided. Nay, they were already beginning to forget the old white-bearded gentleman when the manager opened the door of the large drawing room.

Thus the march past could not be organized, and men and women entered anyhow, joking with homely good humor over this absence of ceremony. A long table stretched from one end to the other of the great room, which had been entirely cleared of furniture, and this same table was not long enough, for the plates thereon were touching one another. Four candelabra, with ten candles apiece, lit up the supper, and of these one was gorgeous in silver plate with sheaves of flowers to right and left of it. Everything was luxurious after the restaurant fashion; the china was ornamented with a gold line and lacked the customary monogram; the silver had become worn and tarnished through dint of continual washings; the glass was of the kind that you can complete an odd set of in any cheap emporium.

Then came Labordette and, finally, at the two ends of the table were irregular crowding groups of young men and of women, such as Simonne, Lea de Horn and Maria Blond.

The waiters took away the soup plates and circulated rissoles of young rabbit with truffles and "niokys" and powdered cheese. Bordenave agitated the whole table with the announcement that at one moment he had had the idea of bringing with him Prulliere, Fontan and old Bosc. At this Nana looked sedate and remarked dryly that she would have given them a pretty reception. Had she wanted colleagues, she would certainly have undertaken to ask them herself. No, no, she wouldn't have third-rate play actors. Old Bosc was always drunk; Prulliere was fond of spitting too much, and as to Fontan, he made himself unbearable in society with his loud voice and his stupid doings. Then, you know, third-rate play actors were always out of place when they found themselves in the society of gentlemen such as those around her.

The old gentleman was as deliberate in his movements and wore as subtle a smile as though he were presiding over a diplomatic congress, and Vandeuvres, with his exquisite politeness toward the ladies next to him, seemed to be at one of the Countess Muffat's receptions. That very morning Nana had been remarking to her aunt that in the matter of men one could not have done better—they were all either wellborn or wealthy, in fact, quite the thing. And as to the ladies, they were behaving admirably. Some of them, such as Blanche, Lea and Louise, had come in low dresses, but Gaga's only was perhaps a little too low, the more so because at her age she would have done well not to show her neck at all. Now that the company were finally settled the laughter and the light jests began to fail. Georges was under the impression that he had assisted at merrier dinner parties among the good folks of Orleans. There was scarcely any conversation. The men, not being mutually acquainted, stared at one another, while the women sat quite quiet, and it was this which especially surprised Georges.

When as first fiddle in the music hall where she used to sing he had married her, they had been passionately fond of one another. Now they were good friends. There was an understanding between them: she labored hard to the full extent of her talent and of her beauty; he had given up his violin in order the better to watch over her successes as an actress and as a woman.

If at her time of life she hadn't laid by a sou but was still always working to minister to men's pleasures, especially those very young men, whose grandmother she might well be, it was truly because she considered a good match of far greater importance than mere savings.

After the third course the entrees had made their appearance; they consisted of pullets a la marechale, fillets of sole with shallot sauce and escalopes of Strasbourg pate. The manager, who till then had been having Meursault served, now offered Chambertin and Leoville. Amid the slight hubbub which the change of plates involved Georges, who was growing momentarily more astonished, asked Daguenet if all the ladies present were similarly provided with children, and the other, who was amused by this question, gave him some further details. Lucy Stewart was the daughter of a man of English origin who greased the wheels of the trains at the Gare du Nord; she was thirty-nine years old and had the face of a horse but was adorable withal and, though consumptive, never died. In fact, she was the smartest woman there and represented three princes and a duke. Caroline Hequet, born at Bordeaux, daughter of a little clerk long since dead of shame, was lucky enough to be possessed of a mother with a head on her shoulders, who, after having cursed her, had made it up again at the end of a year of reflection, being minded, at any rate, to save a fortune for her daughter. The latter was twenty-five years old and very passionless and was held to be one of the finest women it is possible to enjoy. Her price never varied. The mother, a model of orderliness, kept the accounts and noted down receipts and expenditures with severe precision. She managed the whole household from some small lodging two stories above her daughter's, where, moreover, she had established a workroom for dressmaking and plain sewing. As to Blanche de Sivry, whose real name was Jacqueline Bandu, she hailed from a village near Amiens. Magnificent in person, stupid and untruthful in character, she gave herself out as the granddaughter of a general and never owned to her thirty-two summers. The Russians had a great taste for her, owing to her embonpoint. Then Daguenet added a rapid word or two about the rest. There was Clarisse Besnus, whom a lady had brought up from Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer in the capacity of maid while the lady's husband had started her in quite another line. There was Simonne Cabiroche, the daughter of a furniture dealer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, who had been educated in a large boarding school with a view to becoming a governess. Finally there were Maria Blond and Louise Violaine and Lea de Horn, who had all shot up to woman's estate on the pavements of Paris, not to mention Tatan Nene, who had herded cows in Champagne till she was twenty.

Then, just as last night, they passed on to a discussion on music, after which, Foucarmont having let slip some mention of the assumption of the veil of which Paris was still talking, Nana grew quite interested and insisted on details about Mlle de Fougeray. Oh, the poor child, fancy her burying herself alive like that! Ah well, when it was a question of vocation! All round the table the women expressed themselves much touched, and Georges, wearied at hearing these things a second time discussed, was beginning to ask Daguenet about Nana's ways in private life, when the conversation veered fatefully back to Count Bismarck. Tatan Nene bent toward Labordette to ask him privily who this Bismarck might be, for she did not know him. Whereupon Labordette, in cold blood, told her some portentous anecdotes. This Bismarck, he said, was in the habit of eating raw meat and when he met a woman near his den would carry her off thither on his back; at forty years of age he had already had as many as thirty-two children that way.

The banker was noted for his sudden flames. That terrible German Jew who brewed money, whose hands forged millions, was wont to turn imbecile whenever he became enamored of a woman. He wanted them all too! Not one could make her appearance on the stage but he bought her, however expensive she might be. Vast sums were quoted. Twice had his furious appetite for courtesans ruined him. The courtesans, as Vandeuvres used to say, avenged public morality by emptying his moneybags. A big operation in the saltworks of the Landes had rendered him powerful on 'change, and so for six weeks past the Mignons had been getting a pretty slice out of those same saltworks. But people were beginning to lay wagers that the Mignons would not finish their slice, for Nana was showing her white teeth. Once again Steiner was in the toils, and so deeply this time that as he sat by Nana's side he seemed stunned; he ate without appetite; his lip hung down; his face was mottled. She had only to name a figure. Nevertheless, she did not hurry but continued playing with him, breathing her merry laughter into his hairy ear and enjoying the little convulsive movements which kept traversing his heavy face. There would always be time enough to patch all that up if that ninny of a Count Muffat were really to treat her as Joseph did Potiphar's wife.

Why, Rose cried with rage when she read Leon's article on Nana; I know she did. So now, you understand, she must have an article, too, and she's gaining it.

This produced a fortunate diversion. Yet the supper was flagging; no one was eating now, though platefuls of cepes a' l'italienne and pineapple fritters a la Pompadour were being mangled. The champagne, however, which had been drunk ever since the soup course, was beginning little by little to warm the guests into a state of nervous exaltation. They ended by paying less attention to decorum than before. The women began leaning on their elbows amid the disordered table arrangements, while the men, in order to breathe more easily, pushed their chairs back, and soon the black coats appeared buried between the light-colored bodices, and bare shoulders, half turned toward the table, began to gleam as soft as silk. It was too hot, and the glare of the candles above the table grew ever yellower and duller. Now and again, when a women bent forward, the back of her neck glowed golden under a rain of curls, and the glitter of a diamond clasp lit up a lofty chignon. There was a touch of fire in the passing jests, in the laughing eyes, in the sudden gleam of white teeth, in the reflection of the candelabra on the surface of a glass of champagne. The company joked at the tops of their voices, gesticulated, asked questions which no one answered and called to one another across the whole length of the room. But the loudest din was made by the waiters; they fancied themselves at home in the corridors of their parent restaurant; they jostled one another and served the ices and the dessert to an accompaniment of guttural exclamations.

Tatan Nene, greatly astonished at the thought that she had overeaten herself, was laughing vaguely over her own stupidity. The others, such as Blanche, Caroline, Simonne and Maria, were all talking at once and telling each other about their private affairs—about a dispute with a coachman, a projected picnic and innumerable complex stories of lovers stolen or restored. Meanwhile a young man near Georges, having evinced a desire to kiss Lea de Horn, received a sharp rap, accompanied by a "Look here, you, let me go!" which was spoken in a tone of fine indignation; and Georges, who was now very tipsy and greatly excited by the sight of Nana, hesitated about carrying out a project which he had been gravely maturing. He had been planning, indeed, to get under the table on all fours and to go and crouch at Nana's feet like a little dog. Nobody would have seen him, and he would have stayed there in the quietest way. But when at Lea's urgent request Daguenet had told the young man to sit still, Georges all at once felt grievously chagrined, as though the reproof had just been leveled at him. Oh, it was all silly and slow, and there was nothing worth living for! Daguenet, nevertheless, began chaffing and obliged him to swallow a big glassful of water, asking him at the same time what he would do if he were to find himself alone with a woman, seeing that three glasses of champagne were able to bowl him over.

Vandeuvres, whose subtle countenance was darkening visibly, insisted on his restoring Labordette his sex. The other men—Mignon, Steiner and Bordenave—who were by this time much exalted, also intervened with shouts which drowned his voice.

All this company had overwhelmed and bewildered her with their shouts to the waiters, the loudness of their voices and the way in which they put themselves at their ease, just as though they were in a restaurant. Forgetting her role of hostess, she busied herself exclusively with bulky Steiner, who was verging on apoplexy beside her. She was listening to his proposals and continually refusing them with shakes of the head and that temptress's laughter which is peculiar to a voluptuous blonde. The champagne she had been drinking had flushed her a rosy-red; her lips were moist; her eyes sparkled, and the banker's offers rose with every kittenish movement of her shoulders, with every little voluptuous lift and fall of her throat, which occurred when she turned her head. Close by her ear he kept espying a sweet little satiny corner which drove him crazy. Occasionally Nana was interrupted, and then, remembering her guests, she would try and be as pleased as possible in order to show that she knew how to receive. Toward the end of the supper she was very tipsy. It made her miserable to think of it, but champagne had a way of intoxicating her almost directly! Then an exasperating notion struck her. In behaving thus improperly at her table, these ladies were showing themselves anxious to do her an ugly turn. Oh yes, she could see it all distinctly. Lucy had given Foucarmont a wink in order to egg him on against Labordette, while Rose, Caroline and the others were doing all they could to stir up the men. Now there was such a din you couldn't hear your neighbor speak, and so the story would get about that you might allow yourself every kind of liberty when you supped at Nana's. Very well then! They should see! She might be tipsy, if you like, but she was still the smartest and most ladylike woman there.

The waiters behind him were already busy removing the plates and dishes in obedience to the loudly voiced orders of the manager.

They did without her excellently well, and everybody helped himself and rummaged in the drawers of the sideboard in search of teaspoons, which were lacking.

He continued to gaze sneeringly at Labordette, who was drinking his coffee in the midst of the ladies. And occasionally he gave vent to fragmentary assertions, as thus: "He's the son of a horse dealer; some say the illegitimate child of a countess. Never a penny of income, yet always got twenty-five louis in his pocket! Footboy to the ladies of the town! A big lubber, who never goes with any of 'em!

She had been quite right to prophesy that matters would end badly, and now she would have her work cut out for the remainder of the night. Gaga reassured her. She examined the officer with the eye of a woman of experience and declared that there was nothing much the matter and that the gentleman would sleep like that for at least a dozen or fifteen hours without any serious consequences. Foucarmont was carried off.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_778');"><p>Yes, she had certainly flown away somewhere on leaving the table. The company suddenly recollected her, and everybody asked for her. Steiner, who for some seconds had been uneasy on her account, asked Vandeuvres about the old gentleman, for he, too, had disappeared. But the count reassured him—he had just brought the old gentleman back. He was a stranger, whose name it was useless to mention. Suffice it to say that he was a very rich man who was quite pleased to pay for suppers! Then as Nana was once more being forgotten, Vandeuvres saw Daguenet looking out of an open door and beckoning to him. And in the bedroom he found the mistress of the house sitting up, white-lipped and rigid, while Daguenet and Georges stood gazing at her with an alarmed expression.
</p></origin><translate id="div_778" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>是的，娜娜离开饭桌以后，就不知道飞到哪里去了。这时，大家都想起了她，都嚷着要她回来。斯泰内愁了一阵子，他问旺德夫尔那位老先生到哪里去了，因为他也不见了。不过，伯爵安慰他说，他刚把老先生送走，他是个外国人，名字就不必要说了，他很有钱，他很乐意支付夜宵的全部费用。尔后，娜娜又被大家忘记时，旺德夫尔瞥见达盖内打开一扇门，探出头来叫他进去。他走进卧室，发现东道女主人坐在那里，一动也不动，嘴唇发白，而达盖内和乔治则站在那里，神色沮丧地注视着她。

Catch her bothering herself again just to be badgered for it after! She really didn't know what kept her from chucking all that dirty lot out of the house! And with this, rage choked her and her voice broke down in sobs.

They would never get her to believe that Fauchery had not put the Count Muffat off coming! A regular snake was that Fauchery, an envious sort, a fellow capable of growing mad against a woman and of destroying her whole happiness. For she knew this—the count had become madly devoted to her! She could have had him!

She wanted Paul and Georges always to agree, because it would be so nice for them all three to stay like that, knowing all the time that they loved one another very much. But an extraordinary noise disturbed them: someone was snoring in the room. Whereupon after some searching they perceived Bordenave, who, since taking his coffee, must have comfortably installed himself there. He was sleeping on two chairs, his head propped on the edge of the bed and his leg stretched out in front. Nana thought him so funny with his open mouth and his nose moving with each successive snore that she was shaken with a mad fit of laughter. She left the room, followed by Daguenet and Georges, crossed the dining room, entered the drawing room, her merriment increasing at every step.
</p></origin><translate id="div_796" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着，她见乔治见到他们拥抱，涨红了脸，于是，她也拥抱了乔治。咪咪不会对一个孩子吃醋的。她希望保尔和乔治永远和睦相处，如果三个人都知道彼此相爱，并且一直保持下去，那该多好呀。 这时，一个奇怪的声音干扰了他们，有一个人在卧室里打鼾。于是，他们寻找了一会，发现是博尔德纳夫，他喝过咖啡后，就舒舒服服地躺在那里了。他睡在两张椅子上，头枕在床沿上，腿伸得笔直，张着嘴巴，打一个呼噜鼻子就动一下。娜娜觉得他那样子很滑稽，不禁大笑起来。她走出卧室，身后跟着达盖内和乔治，他们穿过餐厅，进入客厅，笑得越来越厉害。

And then there was a burst of laughter, and when one of them told the rest to be quiet Bordenave's distant snorings became audible.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_799');"><p>It was close on four o'clock. In the dining room a card table had just been set out, at which Vandeuvres, Steiner, Mignon and Labordette had taken their seats. Behind them Lucy and Caroline stood making bets, while Blanche, nodding with sleep and dissatisfied about her night, kept asking Vandeuvres at intervals of five minutes if they weren't going soon. In the drawing room there was an attempt at dancing. Daguenet was at the piano or "chest of drawers," as Nana called it. She did not want a "thumper," for Mimi would play as many waltzes and polkas as the company desired. But the dance was languishing, and the ladies were chatting drowsily together in the corners of sofas. Suddenly, however, there was an outburst of noise. A band of eleven young men had arrived and were laughing loudly in the anteroom and crowding to the drawing room. They had just come from the ball at the Ministry of the Interior and were in evening dress and wore various unknown orders. Nana was annoyed at this riotous entry, called to the waiters who still remained in the kitchen and ordered them to throw these individuals out of doors. She vowed that she had never seen any of them before. Fauchery, Labordette, Daguenet and the rest of the men had all come forward in order to enforce respectful behavior toward their hostess. Big words flew about; arms were outstretched, and for some seconds a general exchange of fisticuffs was imminent. Notwithstanding this, however, a little sickly looking light-haired man kept insistently repeating:
</p></origin><translate id="div_799" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>快到四点钟了。餐厅里摆好了一张赌桌，旺德夫尔、斯泰内、米尼翁和拉博德特已经坐在桌子旁，吕西和卡罗利娜站在他们后面押注；布朗瑟很困倦，觉得这一夜过得很窝囊，每隔五分钟，就催问旺德夫尔一次，问他们是不是马上就回家。呆在客厅里的人都想跳舞。达盖内已经坐到钢琴前面，娜娜叫它“五斗柜”，她不想让蹩脚钢琴手来弹，只要大家要咪咪弹，他就能弹出华尔兹舞曲和波尔卡舞曲来。但是，舞跳得没精打采，妇女们都深深地躺在长沙发上闲聊，个个精神不振。突然间，听见一阵嘈杂声。有十一个青年人结伴而来，他们到候见厅时就放声大笑，到了客厅门口时又互相推推搡搡；他们刚刚参加了内务部的舞会，每人穿着晚礼服，戴着白领带，衣服上佩戴着一串大家都不认识的十字勋章。他们这样吵吵闹闹的进来，娜娜很生气。她呼唤呆在厨房里的侍者，叫他们把那群人赶出去；她发誓说，这帮人她从来没见过。福什利、拉博德特、达盖内等所有男人一起走上去，叫他们要尊重女主人。霎时间，他们破口大骂粗话，拳头也伸出来了。那一刻，大家真担心会大打一场。然而，就在这当口，一个面带病容、金发、矮个子的小伙子连声说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_800');"><p>"Come, come, Nana, you saw us the other evening at Peters' in the great red saloon! Pray remember, you invited us."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_802');"><p>And when the little light-haired man had mentioned the day, which was Wednesday, she distinctly remembered having supped at Peters' on the Wednesday, but she had given no invitation to anyone; she was almost sure of that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_802" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>金发小伙子告诉她，那一天是星期三。这下她可回忆起来了，星期三她确实在彼得斯家吃过夜宵，可是她却没有邀请任何人呀，这一点她几乎完全可以肯定。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_803');"><p>"However, suppose you HAVE invited them, my good girl," murmured Labordette, who was beginning to have his doubts. "Perhaps you were a little elevated."
</p></origin><translate id="div_803" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不过，姑娘，如果你真邀请过他们呢，”拉博德特喃喃说道，他开始有点怀疑了，“也许当时你有点高兴了吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_804');"><p>Then Nana fell a-laughing. It was quite possible; she really didn't know. So then, since these gentlemen were on the spot, they had her leave to come in. Everything was quietly arranged; several of the newcomers found friends in the drawing room, and the scene ended in handshakings. The little sickly looking light-haired man bore one of the greatest names in France. Furthermore, the eleven announced that others were to follow them, and, in fact, the door opened every few moments, and men in white gloves and official garb presented themselves. They were still coming from the ball at the Ministry. Fauchery jestingly inquired whether the minister was not coming, too, but Nana answered in a huff that the minister went to the houses of people she didn't care a pin for. What she did not say was that she was possessed with a hope of seeing Count Muffat enter her room among all that stream of people. He might quite have reconsidered his decision, and so while talking to Rose she kept a sharp eye on the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_804" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是娜娜笑了起来。这倒也可能，但是她却没有一点印象。总之，既然这些先生已经来了，就让他们进来吧。问题都解决了，好几个新来者在客厅里还见到了自己的朋友，这场风波最后以握手而告终。那个面带病容的金发小个子是法兰西的一个名门望族的后代。新来的一帮人还声称，还有一些人要来；果然不错，门不时被打开，又进来一些先生，他们戴着白手套，身着礼服。这批人也是从内务部的舞会上来的。福什利开玩笑说，内务部长是不是也要来。娜娜很恼火，说部长要去的人家肯定都比不上她家。她只字不提的事情，是埋在她心底的一个希望，她希望在这群进来的人中，有一个人是缪法伯爵。缪法伯爵可能改变了主意吧。她一边同罗丝谈话，一边注视着门口。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_805');"><p>Five o'clock struck. The dancing had ceased, and the cardplayers alone persisted in their game. Labordette had vacated his seat, and the women had returned into the drawing room. The air there was heavy with the somnolence which accompanies a long vigil, and the lamps cast a wavering light while their burned-out wicks glowed red within their globes. The ladies had reached that vaguely melancholy hour when they felt it necessary to tell each other their histories. Blanche de Sivry spoke of her grandfather, the general, while Clarisse invented a romantic story about a duke seducing her at her uncle's house, whither he used to come for the boar hunting. Both women, looking different ways, kept shrugging their shoulders and asking themselves how the deuce the other could tell such whoppers! As to Lucy Stewart, she quietly confessed to her origin and of her own accord spoke of her childhood and of the days when her father, the wheel greaser at the Northern Railway Terminus, used to treat her to an apple puff on Sundays.
</p></origin><translate id="div_805" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>五点钟敲响了。大家不跳舞了。只有打牌的人还在坚持打牌。拉博德特把他的位置让给了别人，女人们又回到了客厅里。灯光朦朦胧胧，客厅里长时间熬夜的困倦气氛越发变浓，燃烧的灯芯映红了灯罩。此时此刻，她们不禁触景生情，隐隐忧伤之感油然而生，感到需要讲讲自己的身世。布朗瑟德西弗里谈起她的祖父，他是一位将军；克拉利瑟则胡诌了一则故事，说她在她的伯父家里时，有一位公爵去猎野猪，如何引诱她。她们两人都把背朝着对方，听了对方的话，一边耸着肩膀，一边思量着：天啦！她怎么能编造出这样的谎言呢。至于吕西斯图华，则平心静气地讲了自己的出身，她很乐意谈自己的青年时代，那时候，她的父亲是巴黎北火车站的加油工人，每逢星期天都让她吃上苹果酱馅饼。

"Opposite to me there lives a gentleman, a Russian, an awfully rich man! Well, just fancy, yesterday I received a basket of fruit—oh, it just was a basket! Enormous peaches, grapes as big as that, simply wonderful for the time of year! And in the middle of them six thousand-franc notes! It was the Russian's doing.

Besides, to think that such things should happen to trollops like her! Infinite was their contempt for her among themselves. It was Lucy of whom they were particularly jealous, for they were beside themselves at the thought of her three princes. Since Lucy had begun taking a daily morning ride in the Bois they all had become Amazons, as though a mania possessed them.

Rose Mignon had refused to sing the "Slipper" and sat huddled up on a sofa, chatting in a low voice with Fauchery and waiting for Mignon, who had by now won some fifty louis from Vandeuvres. A fat gentleman with a decoration and a serious cast of countenance had certainly given a recitation in Alsatian accents of "Abraham's Sacrifice," a piece in which the Almighty says, "By My blasted Name" when He swears, and Isaac always answers with a "Yes, Papa!" Nobody, however, understood what it was all about, and the piece had been voted stupid. People were at their wits' end how to make merry and to finish the night with fitting hilarity. For a moment or two Labordette conceived the idea of denouncing different women in a whisper to La Faloise, who still went prowling round each individual lady, looking to see if she were hiding his handkerchief in her bosom. Soon, as there were still some bottles of champagne on the sideboard, the young men again fell to drinking. They shouted to one another; they stirred each other up, but a dreary species of intoxication, which was stupid enough to drive one to despair, began to overcome the company beyond hope of recovery. Then the little fair-haired fellow, the man who bore one of the greatest names in France and had reached his wit's end and was desperate at the thought that he could not hit upon something really funny, conceived a brilliant notion: he snatched up his bottle of champagne and poured its contents into the piano. His allies were convulsed with laughter.

In a corner by themselves Maria Blond and Lea de Horn had begun squabbling at close quarters, the former accusing the latter of consorting with people of insufficient wealth. They were getting vastly abusive over it, their chief stumbling block being the good looks of the men in question. Lucy, who was plain, got them to hold their tongues. Good looks were nothing, according to her; good figures were what was wanted. Farther off, on a sofa, an attache had slipped his arm round Simonne's waist and was trying to kiss her neck, but Simonne, sullen and thoroughly out of sorts, pushed him away at every fresh attempt with cries of "You're pestering me!" and sound slaps of the fan across his face. For the matter of that, not one of the ladies allowed herself to be touched. Did people take them for light women? Gaga, in the meantime, had once more caught La Faloise and had almost hoisted him upon her knees while Clarisse was disappearing from view between two gentlemen, shaking with nervous laughter as women will when they are tickled. Round about the piano they were still busy with their little game, for they were suffering from a fit of stupid imbecility, which caused each man to jostle his fellow in his frantic desire to empty his bottle into the instrument. It was a simple process and a charming one.

So much the worse! It was all on account of that Muffat, who had refused what was offered him. Sitting there in her white foulard dress, which was as light and full of folds as a shift, sitting there with drooped eyelids and cheeks pale with the touch of intoxication from which she was suffering, she offered herself to him with that quiet expression which is peculiar to a good-natured courtesan. The roses in her hair and at her throat had lost their leaves, and their stalks alone remained. Presently Steiner withdrew his hand quickly from the folds of her skirt, where he had come in contact with the pins that Georges had stuck there. Some drops of blood appeared on his fingers, and one fell on Nana's dress and stained it.

And with that the guests began to take their departure. It was a most sour and uncomfortable retreat. Caroline Hequet, annoyed at the loss of her night, announced that it was high time to be off unless you were anxious to assist at some pretty scenes. Rose pouted as if her womanly character had been compromised. It was always so with these girls; they didn't know how to behave and were guilty of disgusting conduct when they made their first appearance in society! And Mignon having cleaned Vandeuvres out completely, the family took their departure. They did not trouble about Steiner but renewed their invitation for tomorrow to Fauchery. Lucy thereupon refused the journalist's escort home and sent him back shrilly to his "strolling actress." At this Rose turned round immediately and hissed out a "Dirty sow" by way of answer. But Mignon, who in feminine quarrels was always paternal, for his experience was a long one and rendered him superior to them, had already pushed her out of the house, telling her at the same time to have done. Lucy came downstairs in solitary state behind them. After which Gaga had to carry off La Faloise, ill, sobbing like a child, calling after Clarisse, who had long since gone off with her two gentlemen. Simonne, too, had vanished. Indeed, none remained save Tatan, Lea and Maria, whom Labordette complaisantly took under his charge.

It was six o'clock in the morning. Over the way, on the opposite side of the Boulevard Haussmann, the glistening roofs of the still-slumbering houses were sharply outlined against the twilight sky while along the deserted roadway a gang of street sweepers passed with a clatter of wooden shoes. As she viewed Paris thus grimly awakening, she was overcome by tender, girlish feelings, by a yearning for the country, for idyllic scenes, for things soft and white.
