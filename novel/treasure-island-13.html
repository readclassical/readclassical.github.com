</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_570');"><p>FROM the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees. My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. What it was, whether bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell. It seemed dark and shaggy; more I knew not. But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_570" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>从陡峭而多石的这一侧的小丘上头，扑籁籁地掉下来一堆沙砾，穿过树木纷纷落下来。我的眼睛本能地向那个方向转去，我看到有一个身影飞快地向松树树干后面跳去。它究竟为何物，是熊。是人、还是猿猴，我怎么也说不上来。它看上去黑乎乎、毛茸茸的；更多的我就不知道了。但是这个新出现的吓人的东西使我停了下来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_571');"><p>I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers, before me this lurking nondescript. And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not. Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_571" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>现在看来我是腹背受敌；在我身后是杀人凶手，在我前面是这个隐蔽的怪物。立刻我意识到，与其遭遇未知的危险，莫不如去面对已知的危险。同树林里这个活物比起来，西尔弗他本人也不那么可怕了，于是我转过身去，一边敏锐地关注着我的身后，开始向划子停泊的地方折回我的脚步。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_572');"><p>Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary. From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt about that. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_572" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那个身影立刻又出现了，并且绕了一个大弯，开始拦住了我的路。不管怎么说，我累了，但是我也看得出，即使我像刚动身时那样精力充沛，对我来说，与这样一个对手比速度也是徒劳的。这个家伙像头鹿似地在树干之间跳跃，像人似地用两条腿跑，但和我见过的任何人都不同，当它跑时，身子弯得头几乎要触着地。然而它确实是个人，对此我已不再怀疑了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_573');"><p>I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals. I was within an ace of calling for help. But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild, had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind. As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_573" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我开始回想起我听说过的食人番来。我差一点就要喊救命了。但他毕竟是个人，虽然是个野人，这一点多少使我安心些。同时我对西尔弗的恐惧重又复活了。因此，我便站住了，一边想着如何逃跑；当我正这么想着的时候，我摹地想起我还有支手铣。一想到我并非毫无抵抗能力，我心中又重新生出了勇气，于是我决心面对这个岛上的人，迈着轻快的步子向他走去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_574');"><p>He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must have been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. Then he hesitated, drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_574" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这回他躲在另一棵树的树干后面，但是他一定一直在密切地关注着我，因为一旦我开始向他那边迈步，他便出现了，向我这边迈出了一步。接着他犹豫了，又向后退回去，然后又上前，最后，令我既吃惊又困惑的是，他跪到了地上，十指交叉着向前伸出，一副哀求的样子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_575');"><p>At that I once more stopped. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_575" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这使我再次停下了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_576');"><p>"Who are you?" I asked. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_576" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你是谁？”我问。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_577');"><p>"Ben Gunn," he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward, like a rusty lock. "I'm poor Ben Gunn, I am; and I haven't spoke with a Christian these three years." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_577" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“本葛恩，”他答道，他的声音听起来沙哑而生涩，像把生锈的锁。“我是可怜的本葛恩，是的；我已经有三年没跟人说话啦。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_578');"><p>I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing. His skin, wherever it was exposed, was burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed with tatters of old ship's canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin. About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_578" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>现在我已看出，他是个和我一样的白人，并且他的长相还蛮好看。他裸露着的皮肤都被太阳晒黑了，甚至他的嘴唇都是黑的；在这样黑的一张脸上，他的明亮的眼睛着实使人吃惊。在所有我见过或想像出来的乞丐中，他是穿得最破烂的。他穿着船上的旧帆布和防水布的碎片缀成的衣服，这件不同寻常的鹑衣全都是用一系列各不相同、极不协调的栓结物连缀到一块儿的，如铜扣、小细棍以及涂了柏油的束帆索环儿。在他的腰间系着一条旧的带钢扣的皮带，那是他全身上下最结实的一样东西了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_579');"><p>"Three years!" I cried. "Were you shipwrecked?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_579" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“三年！”我叫道。“是船只失事了吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_580');"><p>"Nay, mate," said he; "marooned." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_580" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，朋友，”他说——“是被放逐的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_581');"><p>I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_581" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我听过这个字眼，我因此知道这是海盗中相当普通但是可怕的一种惩罚手段，只给受罚者一点弹药，然后将他甩在某个遥远的荒岛上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_582');"><p>"Marooned three years agone," he continued, "and lived on goats since then, and berries, and oysters. Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke up again, and here I were." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_582" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是三年前被放逐的，”他继续说道，“从那以后，就以山羊为生，还有浆果和牡蛎。要我说，人到哪儿都能自谋生路。但是，朋友，我一心向往文明人的饮食。你现在身上是否碰巧带着块干酪？没有？哎，多少个长夜我都梦见干酪——多半是烤好的——等梦醒了，我还是在这儿。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_583');"><p>"If ever I can get aboard again," said I, "you shall have cheese by the stone." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_583" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要是我还能回到船上，”我说，“你就会有成堆的干酪吃。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_584');"><p>All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature. But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_584" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说话间他一直在抚摸我衣服的料子，抚摸我光滑的手，观赏我的鞋，总之，在他说话的间歇里，对于一个同类的出现，他表现出了一种孩子气的高兴。但是听了我最后的话，他抬起头来，露出一种吃惊和狡黠的神气。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_585');"><p>"If ever you can get aboard again, says you?" he repeated. "Why, now, who's to hinder you?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_585" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要是你还能回到船上，你是这么说的吗？”他重复道。“怎么，现在谁在阻拦你吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_586');"><p>"Not you, I know," was my reply. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_586" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道不是你。”我答道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_587');"><p>"And right you was," he cried. "Now you--what do you call yourself, mate?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_587" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说得对，”他叫道。“那么你——你叫什么名字，朋友？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_588');"><p>"Jim," I told him. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_588" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“吉姆。”我告诉他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_589');"><p>"Jim, Jim," says he, quite pleased apparently. "Well, now, Jim, I've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you wouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?" he asked. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_589" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“吉姆，吉姆，”他说，显然很高兴。“你瞧，吉姆，我过的这种苦日子连你听了都会害臊。嗯，比方说吧，你瞧我这副模样，不会想到我有个信神的母亲吧？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_590');"><p>"Why, no, not in particular," I answered. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_590" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“噢，不，没专门想过。”我答道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_591');"><p>"Ah, well," said he, "but I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't tell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it begun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim"--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--"I'm rich." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_591" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，好吧，”他说，“但是我有的——我的母亲非常的虔诚。我也曾经是个有礼貌的、信神的孩子，我可以把教义背得那么快，以至于你连字句都无法分辨出来。而这会儿我却到了这个地步，吉姆，这都是从我在那该死的墓石上扔铜板赌博开始的！就是玩这个起的头，但是越走越远。我母亲早就告诫过我，她全都预料到了，这个虔诚的女人！把我放到这儿是天意如此。我在这个孤岛上全都仔细想过了，我又皈依上帝了。你可别引诱我喝太多的郎姆酒，不过可以为了祝好运而喝那么一点点，当然，要是有机会的话。我已决定一心向善，我也知道怎么办。而且，吉姆，”他边环顾四周边压低嗓子说——“我发财了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_592');"><p>I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: "Rich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_592" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>现在我觉得这个可怜的人在孤独的生活中有些精神失常了，我猜想我一定把这感觉流露到脸上了，因为他又热切地重复了一遍： “我发财了！发财了！我跟你说。我还可以告诉你：我会把你变成一个真正的男子汉，吉姆。啊，吉姆，你该庆幸吉星高照，你真是幸运，你是第一个找到我的人！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_593');"><p>And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_593" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说着，他的脸上突然掠过一道阴影，接着他紧紧地抓住了我的手，还竖起一根食指在我的眼前比划着。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_594');"><p>"Now, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?" he asked. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_594" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“听着，吉姆，你得给我讲实话：那是弗林特的船吗？”他问道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_595');"><p>At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_595" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>听了这话，我欢欣鼓舞。我开始相信我找到了一个盟友，于是我立刻答复了他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_596');"><p>"It's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_596" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那不是弗林特的船，弗林特已经死了。但是我跟你讲实话，就像你要求的那样——船上有些弗林特的部下；我们其余这些人遭殃了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_597');"><p>"Not a man--with one--leg?" he gasped. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_597" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有没有一个——一条腿的人？”他倒抽了口气问道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_598');"><p>"Silver?" I asked. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_598" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“西尔弗？”我问。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_599');"><p>"Ah, Silver!" says he. "That were his name." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_599" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，西尔弗！”他说，“就是这个名字。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_600');"><p>"He's the cook, and the ringleader too." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_600" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他是厨子，也是他们的头子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_601');"><p>He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_601" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他仍握着我的手腕，听了我的话，他又用力地扭了一下。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_602');"><p>"If you was sent by Long John," he said, "I'm as good as pork, and I know it. But where was you, do you suppose?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_602" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要是你是高个子约翰派来的，”他说，“我就完了，这一点我是知道的。但你想你现在处境怎样？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_603');"><p>I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted me on the head. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_603" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我立即打定主意，在回答时顺便把我们航行的整个经过以及我们现在的处境都告诉了他。他津津有味地听完了我的叙述，当我说完时，他拍了拍我的脑袋。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_604');"><p>"You're a good lad, Jim," he said; "and you're all in a clove hitch, ain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you remark?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_604" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你是个好孩子，吉姆，”他说，“可是你们全都上了圈套了，是不是？好吧，你信任本葛恩好了——我本葛恩会给你们帮忙。呢，要是有人能救你们的乡绅摆脱圈套，你认为他在报答援助方面会不会慷慨——就像你对他评论的那样？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_605');"><p>I told him the squire was the most liberal of men. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_605" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我告诉他乡绅是最慷慨的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_606');"><p>"Aye, but you see," returned Ben Gunn, "I didn't mean giving me a gate to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark, Jim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_606" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，但是你要明白，”本葛恩答道，“我不是指给我份看门的差事或一套号衣什么的，那并不是我想要的，吉姆。我的意思是，他能否愿意从那笔可说已到手的钱财里拿出，比方说一千镑，作为酬报？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_607');"><p>"I am sure he would," said I. "As it was, all hands were to share." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_607" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我肯定他会的，”我说。“本来就是如此，全船的人本来都有份的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_608');"><p>"AND a passage home?" he added with a look of great shrewdness. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_608" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还允许我搭船回家？”他又加上一句，一副鬼精灵的样子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_609');"><p>"Why," I cried, "the squire's a gentleman. And besides, if we got rid of the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_609" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然，”我叫道，“乡绅是个绅士，并且，要是我们除掉了那些人的话，还要劳你把船开回家哩。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_610');"><p>"Ah," said he, "so you would." And he seemed very much relieved. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_610" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，”他说，“你们会这么做的。”他这才放了心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_611');"><p>"Now, I'll tell you what," he went on. "So much I'll tell you, and no more. I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure; he and six along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS. One fine day up went the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_611" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“听着，我来给你讲是怎么回事，”他继续说道，“我要告诉你的就这些，再没有别的了。当弗林特埋宝的时候，我在他的船上。他和六个人去了——六个强壮的水手。他们在岸上停留了有一个星期光景，我们这些人呆在老‘瓦鲁斯’号上。有一天来了信号，接着弗林特自己划着划子来了，脑袋上裹着块青头巾。太阳刚刚升起，他的脸看上去一片煞白。但是，你听好，只有他还在，那六个人全死了——死了，埋了。他怎么干的，我们船上这些人谁也弄不明白。反正无非是恶斗、残杀和暴死——他一个人对付六个。比尔彭斯是大副；高个子约翰，他是舵手；他们问他金银财宝藏在哪儿了，‘啊，’他说，‘你们想的话，可以上岸去，还可以呆在那里，’他说，‘但是至于船，要去搜罗更多的财宝哩，你们这些挨雷劈的！’他就是这么回答他们的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_612');"><p>"Well, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_612" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“却说三年前我在另一条船上，我们看见了这个岛。‘弟兄们，’我说，‘这里有弗林特的宝藏，咱们上岸去找找吧，’船长听了很不高兴，但是水手们都是一个心眼，船于是靠岸了。他们找了十二天，每天他们都骂我个狗血喷头，直到有一天早上，所有的水手都上船了。‘至于你，本葛恩，’他们说，‘给你杆枪，’他们说，‘还有一把铲和一把镐。你可以留在这儿，为你自己去找弗林特的钱财吧，’他们说。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_613');"><p>"Well, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I says." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_613" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就这样，吉姆，三年来我就一直在这儿，从那天起到现在，没吃过一口文明人的饭菜。而现在，你看这儿，看看我。我还像是个水手吗？不像，你得说。照我说也不像。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_614');"><p>And with that he winked and pinched me hard. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_614" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说时他眨巴着眼睛，并且捏了我一下。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_615');"><p>"Just you mention them words to your squire, Jim," he went on. "Nor he weren't, neither--that's the words. Three years he were the man of this island, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say); but the most part of Gunn's time (this is what you'll say)--the most part of his time was took up with another matter. And then you'll give him a nip, like I do." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_615" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你只须跟你们的乡绅这么讲，吉姆，”他继续道：“他自己也说不像，的确不像——你得这么说。三年来，无论黑天白天、晴天雨天，岛上始终只有他一个人；有时，他可能会背上段祈祷文（你得说），有时，他也可能想想他的老母亲，就当她还活着（这你也得说）；但是葛恩的大部分时间（这是你必须说的）——他的大部分时间都花在另一件事上。然后你就要捏他一下，就像我这样。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_616');"><p>And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_616" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说着他就又捏了我一下，神情极其诡秘。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_617');"><p>"Then," he continued, "then you'll up, and you'll say this: Gunn is a good man (you'll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence--a precious sight, mind that--in a gen'leman born than in these gen'leman of fortune, having been one hisself." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_617" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“然后，”他接着讲道——“然后你就接着讲下去，照这么说：——葛恩是个好人（你得说），他对真正的绅士绝对信任，记着说——绝对信任，而那些幸运的大爷们则让人信不过，他以前就是他们中的一个。”
