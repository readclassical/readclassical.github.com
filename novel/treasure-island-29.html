</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1258');"><p>"JIM," said Silver when we were alone, "if I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1258" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“吉姆，”西尔弗说，这时只剩我们两人，“如果说我救了你的命，那么你也救了我的命，我决不会忘记的。我看到大夫刚才招手唤你逃跑，我是凭眼梢瞥见的；我看见你说不行，就跟我的耳朵听到一样。吉姆，这件事你做得真像个正人君子。自从强攻失败之后，我这才第一次看到了一线希望，这应该归功于你。吉姆，现在咱们不得不闭着两眼去探宝，我总觉得这样做很危险。你我必须形影不离，相依为命。那样的话，即使运气再不好，咱们也不致于掉脑袋。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1259');"><p>Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk. They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward, and even there not without precaution. In the same wasteful spirit, they had cooked, I suppose, three times more than we could eat; and one of them, with an empty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1259" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在这时，一个人从火堆那边招呼我们，说早饭准备好了。大家纷纷散坐在沙地上吃着干面包和煎成肉。他们点起的火堆能烤一头牛，现在火旺得很，只能从背风面靠近它，即使这样也得倍加小心。海盗们对食物也是同样浪费，他们准备的饭菜相当于饭量的三倍。一个海盗傻呵呵地笑着把吃剩的东西一下子全都扔进火里；火堆添上这样不寻常的燃料，顿时烈焰冲天、劈啪乱响。我从未见过这样的人，今朝有酒今朝醉，明朝没酒喝凉水。这样形容他们再恰当不过了。像这样糟蹋吃的，放哨时睡大觉，尽管他们能凭着一股蛮劲打一仗，但一旦遇到挫折，我看他们根本应付不了持久战。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1260');"><p>Even Silver, eating away, with Captain Flint upon his shoulder, had not a word of blame for their recklessness. And this the more surprised me, for I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1260" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西尔弗独自坐在一边吃，让鹦鹉弗林特船长蹲在他肩上。他一句话也不说，也不责骂他们的鲁莽妄动，使我感到特别惊讶的是他比以往任何时候更显得老谋深算。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1261');"><p>"Aye, mates," said he, "it's lucky you have Barbecue to think for you with this here head. I got what I wanted, I did. Sure enough, they have the ship. Where they have it, I don't know yet; but once we hit the treasure, we'll have to jump about and find out. And then, mates, us that has the boats, I reckon, has the upper hand." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1261" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂，伙计们，”他说，“有我‘大叉烧’用这颗脑袋为你们着想，我已经偷听到了我要了解的一切。船的确在他们手里。我目前还不知道他们把船藏在什么地方；但只要一发现宝藏，咱们就豁出命来找遍整个海岛，那时定会找到船。伙计们，咱们有两只小船，我想是咱们占上风。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1262');"><p>Thus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot bacon; thus he restored their hope and confidence, and, I more than suspect, repaired his own at the same time. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1262" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他就这样不停地鼓吹着，嘴里塞满了热的煎成肉。他用这样的办法恢复他们的希望和对他的信任，我猜想同时他也在给自己打气。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1263');"><p>"As for hostage," he continued, "that's his last talk, I guess, with them he loves so dear. I've got my piece o' news, and thanky to him for that; but it's over and done. I'll take him in a line when we go treasure-hunting, for we'll keep him like so much gold, in case of accidents, you mark, and in the meantime. Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for all his kindness." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1263" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“至于这个人质，”他继续说，“我想这是他跟他亲爱的人的最后一次谈话了。我听出一些门道，这还得感谢他呢。但现在事情已过去了。咱们去探宝的时候，我要用一根绳子挂住他。要像保护金子那样看牢他，以防万一。这点你们要记住。一旦船和宝藏都到了咱们手里，咱们就高高兴兴地回到海上去。那时再跟霍金斯先生算总账，我们不会亏待他的，会好好答谢他干的好事。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1264');"><p>It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1264" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>无疑他们现在情绪好得很，而我却再也没心情了。要是他刚才提出的计划可行的话，西尔弗，这个两面三刀的叛徒，将毫不犹豫地按计行事。他至今还是脚踏两只船。他毫无疑问更乐于同海盗们一起满载金银财宝逍遥法外，而他们寄托在我们这边的希望只是免去上绞架而已。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1265');"><p>Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a boy--against five strong and active seamen! 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1265" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>再说，即使事态发展到他不得不履行他向利弗西大夫作的保证时，我们的处境也会很危险。一旦他的同伙们的怀疑得到证实，我和他不得不拼死保护自己的小命。他一个瘸子，而我又是一个孩子，如何能对付过五个身强体壮的水手？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1266');"><p>Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade, their inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand, the doctor's last warning to Silver, "Look out for squalls when you find it," and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1266" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>除了这双重的担忧，我的朋友们所采取的行动对我来说始终是个谜：他们为什么会舍弃这个寨子？为什么要交出地图？这些都无法得到解释，还有大夫对西尔弗提出的最后警告：“你们快找到宝藏时，可别大喊大叫的。”读者如果设身处地替我想想，就很容易理解，我吃的早饭为什么味同嚼蜡，为什么跟在海盗们后面出发探宝时会心惊胆颤。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1267');"><p>We made a curious figure, had anyone been there to see us--all in soiled sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth. Silver had two guns slung about him--one before and one behind--besides the great cutlass at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his square-tailed coat. To complete his strange appearance, Captain Flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk. I had a line about my waist and followed obediently after the sea-cook, who held the loose end of the rope, now in his free hand, now between his powerful teeth. For all the world, I was led like a dancing bear. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1267" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>要是有人在旁，定会看到我们一个个奇特的形象：所有的人都身穿脏兮兮的水手服，除了我人人都全副武装。西尔弗身上一前一后挎着两只步枪，腰间还挂着一把大弯刀，他的衣服两边开又，两边口袋里各放了一支手枪。最能体现他这副怪模样的是，鹦鹉弗林特船长蹲在他肩上，无意义地学着水手谈话，不时发出片言只语来。我腰间拴着一条绳子，顺从地跟在厨子后面。他时而腾出一只手抓住松散的绳子的另一端，时而用牙齿紧紧咬住不放。不管怎么说，我都像是头被牵去表演跳舞的狗熊。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1268');"><p>The other men were variously burthened, some carrying picks and shovels--for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore from the HISPANIOLA--others laden with pork, bread, and brandy for the midday meal. All the stores, I observed, came from our stock, and I could see the truth of Silver's words the night before. Had he not struck a bargain with the doctor, he and his mutineers, deserted by the ship, must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting. Water would have been little to their taste; a sailor is not usually a good shot; and besides all that, when they were so short of eatables, it was not likely they would be very flush of powder. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1268" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其他人都扛着各种各样的东西；有的扛着铁锹和镐头——这是他们最先从伊斯班袅拉号带上来的工具；有的扛着午饭时吃的猪肉、干面包和白兰地。我看得出，所有这些东西都是我们贮备下来的。可见昨晚说的是真话。若不是他跟大夫做成了这笔交易，他和他的同伙船丢后只能靠喝凉水，靠打猎过日子了。凉水是不怎么好喝的，而水手又不擅于打猎。再说，水手在吃不上饭的时候，弹药也不会太充裕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1269');"><p>Well, thus equipped, we all set out--even the fellow with the broken head, who should certainly have kept in shadow--and straggled, one after another, to the beach, where the two gigs awaited us. Even these bore trace of the drunken folly of the pirates, one in a broken thwart, and both in their muddy and unbailed condition. Both were to be carried along with us for the sake of safety; and so, with our numbers divided between them, we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1269" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我们就带着这样的装备出发的，连脑袋开花的那个也去了，他本应在阴凉处呆着的。我们就这样一个跟一个拖拖拉拉地来到停有两只小船的岸边。小船里还可以看到海盗们纵酒胡闹的痕迹；一只座板被砸断了，两只小船都沾满泥，船内还有水未被舀干。为了安全起见，我们决定把两只小船都带走，我们分坐在两只船里向锚地底部驶去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1270');"><p>As we pulled over, there was some discussion on the chart. The red cross was, of course, far too large to be a guide; and the terms of the note on the back, as you will hear, admitted of some ambiguity. They ran, the reader may remember, thus: 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1270" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>途中，我们对地图发生了争论，上面的红叉叉画得太大了，看不出确切的地点。背面的字说明的又不清楚。读者也许还记得，上面写着： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1271');"><p>Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to      the N. of N.N.E.      Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E.      Ten feet. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1271" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>望远镜山肩一大树，指向东北偏北，骷髅岛东南东，再向东十英尺，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1272');"><p>A tall tree was thus the principal mark. Now, right before us the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high, adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the Spy-glass and rising again towards the south into the rough, cliffy eminence called the Mizzen-mast Hill. The top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pine-trees of varying height. Every here and there, one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours, and which of these was the particular "tall tree" of Captain Flint could only be decided on the spot, and by the readings of the compass. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1272" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大树是最重要的标记。在我们前方，锚地与一片高约两百至三百英尺的高地连接着。高地的北端与望远镜山的南坡相接，向南则逐渐拱起，形成崎岖多石的后桅山。高矮不一的松树星罗棋布地点缀在高地上。随处可见某一棵四五十英尺高的不同种类的松树鹤立于鸡群。然而弗林特船长所说的“大树”究竟是哪一棵呢，只有到达高地后用罗盘才能测定出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1273');"><p>Yet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, Long John alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1273" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>虽然实际情况就是这样，我们还没到半路，可是小船上的每个人却都认定自己倾心的一棵树。只有高个儿约翰耸了耸肩，建议到了高地上再作打算。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1274');"><p>We pulled easily, by Silver's directions, not to weary the hands prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of the second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass. Thence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1274" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>按照西尔弗的指令，我们划得不很用力，以免过早消耗完体力。经过相当长的路程后，我们在第二条河——就是从望远镜山树多的那面斜坡上流下来的那条——河口处登上了岸。从那向左拐弯，开始沿着山坡攀登高地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1275');"><p>At the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order. It was, indeed, a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. A heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass. Thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh and stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful refreshment to our senses. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1275" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一开始，泥泞难走的地面和乱蓬蓬的沼泽植物大大地耽误了我们赶路。但坡面逐渐趋于陡峭，脚下的土质趋于结实，树木变得高大稀疏，我们正走近的是整个海岛最迷人的地方。草地上到处都是香味浓郁的金雀花和茂盛的灌木丛，一丛丛碧绿的肉豆蔻同村干深红、树阴宽广的松树掩映成趣，肉豆蔻的芳香同松树的清香相得益彰。此外，新鲜的空气振奋人心，在烈日炎炎下，这无疑是一份难得的清心剂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1276');"><p>The party spread itself abroad, in a fan shape, shouting and leaping to and fro. About the centre, and a good way behind the rest, Silver and I followed--I tethered by my rope, he ploughing, with deep pants, among the sliding gravel. From time to time, indeed, I had to lend him a hand, or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1276" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>海盗们成扇形散开，大声叫嚷，跳来跳去，西尔弗和我处于扇面的中心和偏后一点的位置上。我被绳子拴住了，他气喘吁吁地在又松又滑的砾石中开路。有时，我不得不拉他一把，否则他定会失足摔下山崖。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1277');"><p>We had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry aloud, as if in terror. Shout after shout came from him, and the others began to run in his direction. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1277" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我们这样走了大约半英里，快要到达高地顶坡时，忽然最左面的一个人大声叫了起来，好像是受了惊吓似的。他叫了一声又一声，惹得其他人都向他那边跑去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1278');"><p>"He can't 'a found the treasure," said old Morgan, hurrying past us from the right, "for that's clean a-top." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1278" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他不可能是发现了宝藏，”老摩根说着也从右边跑过来，打我们面前匆匆经过，“还没到山顶呢。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1279');"><p>Indeed, as we found when we also reached the spot, it was something very different. At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper, which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human skeleton lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground. I believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1279" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>的确，当我们也到达那边时，我们发现根本不是发现什么宝藏了。在一棵相当高大的松树脚下横着一具死人骨架，被绿色的蔓草缠住了，有几块较小的骨头被局部向上提起，地上残留有一些烂布条。我相信此时每个人心中都不寒而栗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1280');"><p>"He was a seaman," said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest, had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing. "Leastways, this is good sea-cloth." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1280" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他是个水手，”乔治墨利说，他比其他人要胆大些，敢走上前看看衣服的碎片，“至少，他穿的是水手服。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1281');"><p>"Aye, aye," said Silver; "like enough; you wouldn't look to find a bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie? 'Tain't in natur'." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1281" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯，嗯，”西尔弗说，“十有八九是个水手，不可能有主教上这儿来。我想，这骨头架子的姿势可真奇怪，不太自然。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1282');"><p>Indeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position. But for some disarray (the work, perhaps, of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains) the man lay perfectly straight--his feet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his head like a diver's, pointing directly in the opposite. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1282" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>的确，再一看，简直想像不出这个死人怎么会保持这个姿势。除了一些地方乱糟糟而外（也许是吃尸体的大鸟或是逐步缠住尸体的蔓草造成的），死人笔直地躺着，脚指向一方。手像跳水时那样举过头顶，正指着相反的方向。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1283');"><p>"I've taken a notion into my old numbskull," observed Silver. "Here's the compass; there's the tip-top p'int o' Skeleton Island, stickin' out like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them bones." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1283" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我这个死脑瓜骨看出点门道来了，”西尔弗说，“这有罗盘，那是骷髅岛的岬角尖，像颗牙似的支出来。只要顺着这骨头架子测一下方位就知道了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1284');"><p>It was done. The body pointed straight in the direction of the island, and the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1284" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是就取出罗盘来照办。尸体正指向骷髅岛那一边，罗盘标明的方位正是东南东偏东。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1285');"><p>"I thought so," cried the cook; "this here is a p'inter. Right up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But, by thunder! If it don't make me cold inside to think of Flint. This is one of HIS jokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone here; he killed 'em, every man; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver my timbers! They're long bones, and the hair's been yellow. Aye, that would be Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom Morgan?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1285" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不出所料，”厨子叫了起来，“这骨头架子就是指针，从这里对准北极星走定会找到金灿灿的财宝。不过我一想到弗林特就会手脚冰凉。这是他的鬼把戏，肯定错不了。当初只有他和六个人在岸上，他们全都被他杀了，一个被拖到这里放在罗盘对准了的位置上。我敢打赌错不了。瞧，长长的骨头棒、黄黄的头发丝儿，那一定是阿拉代斯。你还记得阿拉代斯，是不是汤姆摩根？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1286');"><p>"Aye, aye," returned Morgan; "I mind him; he owed me money, he did, and took my knife ashore with him." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1286" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯嗯，”摩根回答，“我记得他还欠我钱呢，上岸时还把我的刀子带走了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1287');"><p>"Speaking of knives," said another, "why don't we find his'n lying round? Flint warn't the man to pick a seaman's pocket; and the birds, I guess, would leave it be." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1287" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“提起刀子，”另一个海盗说，“为什么他身上没发现刀子？弗林特不会掏一个水手的口袋，也不可能是被乌叼走了？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1288');"><p>"By the powers, and that's true!" cried Silver. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1288" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这话不假，没错！”西尔弗大声说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1289');"><p>"There ain't a thing left here," said Merry, still feeling round among the bones; "not a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don't look nat'ral to me." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1289" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这里什么也没留下，”墨利说，一边还在骨头架子旁搜寻。“既没有一个铜板也不见烟盒。我觉得有点不对劲。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1290');"><p>"No, by gum, it don't," agreed Silver; "not nat'ral, nor not nice, says you. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living, this would be a hot spot for you and me. Six they were, and six are we; and bones is what they are now." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1290" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是有些不对头，”西尔弗表示同意，“还有点叫人不自在。你们说，心肝们！要是弗林特还活着，这可能就是你我的葬身之地。他们那时是六个人，我们现在正是六个人，可是如今他们只剩下一堆骨头了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1291');"><p>"I saw him dead with these here deadlights," said Morgan. "Billy took me in. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1291" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，我亲眼看见他睁着眼死的，”摩根说，“是比尔带我进去的。他躺在那儿，两眼上各放一枚一便士的铜币，好让他瞑目。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1292');"><p>"Dead--aye, sure enough he's dead and gone below," said the fellow with the bandage; "but if ever sperrit walked, it would be Flint's. Dear heart, but he died bad, did Flint!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1292" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“死了，他确实死了，下了地狱。”头上缠着绷带的那个说，“不过要是真有鬼魂的话，那定是弗林特。天哪，他死时好一阵折腾！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1293');"><p>"Aye, that he did," observed another; "now he raged, and now he hollered for the rum, and now he sang. 'Fifteen Men' were his only song, mates; and I tell you true, I never rightly liked to hear it since. It was main hot, and the windy was open, and I hear that old song comin' out as clear as clear--and the death-haul on the man already." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1293" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯，的确如此，”另一个说，“他一会儿发脾气，一会儿吵着要郎姆酒，一会儿又唱起歌来。他生平只唱一支歌，叫《十五个汉子》。我讲的是真事，我从此以后就讨厌听那支歌。当时天气热得很，窗子开着，我清楚地听到歌声从窗子飘出来，那是小鬼来勾他的魂了。”
