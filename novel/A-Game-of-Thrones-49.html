</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4394');"><p>Jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down on the bench. "I’ve been summoned to the sept," Sam said in an excited whisper. "They’re passing me out of training. I’m to be made a brother with the rest of you. Can you believe it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4394" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆威尔•塔利扑通一声坐上长凳时，琼恩正吃着早餐的苹果蛋糕和血香肠。 “我也要去圣堂了，”山姆难掩兴奋地悄声说，“他们打算让我通过测试，跟你们，一起成为正式的黑衣弟兄。你敢相信吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4395');"><p>"No, truly?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4395" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不相信。这是真的?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4396');"><p>"Truly. I’m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds. He needs someone who can read and write letters."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4396" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真的真的。我被派去协助伊蒙师傅管理图书室和鸟儿。他需要一个能读会写的帮手。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4397');"><p>"You’ll do well at that," Jon said, smiling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4397" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“相信你一定愉快胜任。”琼恩微笑说道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4398');"><p>Sam glanced about anxiously. "Is it time to go? I shouldn’t be late, they might change their minds." He was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn courtyard. The day was warm and sunny. Rivulets of water trickled down the sides of the Wall, so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4398" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆不安地环顾四周。“我们是不是该去了?我们最好不要迟到，免得他们改变主意。”他们走过长满杂草的庭院时，他一直蹦蹦跳跳。天气温润而清朗，晶莹的水滴沿着长城流淌而下，冰层在阳光下闪闪发光。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4399');"><p>Inside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar. Pyp’s mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam, and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs, but no one dared say a word. Septon Celladar was swinging a censer, filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark’s little sept in Winterfell. For once the septon seemed sober.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4399" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>圣堂里，晨光从面南的窗子倾泄进来』寸进当中的大水晶，散出七彩虹光，映着祭坛。派普一见山姆，嘴巴顿时张得老大，陶德则碰了一下葛兰，但没人敢说话。赛勒达修土手中摇晃着一个小香炉，溢得满室馨香，琼恩不禁想起史塔克夫人在临冬城的小圣堂祈祷的情景。修士这次很难得没有喝醉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4400');"><p>The high officers arrived in a body; Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas, Ser Alliser cold-eyed and grim, Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings. Behind them came the senior members of the three orders: red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward, First Builder Othell Yarwyck, and Ser Jaremy Rykker, who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4400" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>高级官员一齐抵达。伊蒙师傅倚靠着克莱达斯，艾里沙爵士冷眼峻脸，莫尔蒙司令一身华服，黑羊毛外衣，银边熊爪扣。在他们后面是三个职业的负责人：总务长波文•马尔锡，首席工匠奥赛尔•亚威克，以及暂代班扬•史塔克指挥游骑兵的杰瑞米•莱克爵士。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4401');"><p>Mormont stood before the altar, the rainbow shining on his broad bald head. "You came to us outlaws," he began, "poachers, rapers, debtors, killers, and thieves. You came to us children. You came to us alone, in chains, with neither friends nor honor. You came to us rich, and you came to us poor. Some of you bear the names of proud houses. Others have only bastards’ names, or no names at all. It makes no matter. All that is past now. On the Wall, we are all one house.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4401" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙站在祭坛前，七彩虹光在他的大光头上闪闪发亮。“你们来时为法律所不容，”他开口，“盗猎、强奸、欠债、杀人、偷抢拐骗。你们来时尚为孩童，一身孑然，身负枷锁，既无友朋，更无荣誉。你们来时或富贵荣禄，或赤贫如洗。你们来自豪门望族，或仅有私生子之名，甚或藉藉无名，但这些都不重要。一切皆成过去。长城之上，我们都是一家人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4402');"><p>"At evenfall, as the sun sets and we face the gathering night, you shall take your vows. From that moment, you will be a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch. Your crimes will be washed away, your debts forgiven. So too you must wash away your former loyalties, put aside your grudges, forget old wrongs and old loves alike. Here you begin anew.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4402" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“今日傍晚，夕阳西沉，低垂夜幕之下，你们便将宣誓。从此以后，你们就是誓言效命的守夜人弟兄。你们的罪名将被洗清，债务业已勾销，同样，你们必须抹去从前的家族忠诚，抛开旧时仇恨，忘却过往的情爱恩怨。你们将于兹重获新生。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4403');"><p>"A man of the Night’s Watch lives his life for the realm. Not for a king, nor a lord, nor the honor of this house or that house, neither for gold nor glory nor a woman’s love, but for the realm, and all the people in it. A man of the Night’s Watch takes no wife and fathers no sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor. And you are the only sons we shall ever know.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4403" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“守夜人为王国效命。非为国王，非为贵族，亦非为豪门荣辱，不论财富，不论光荣，亦不论儿女情爱，一切只为王国安泰及其子民平安。守夜人不娶妻，不生子，我们以责任为妻，以荣誉为妾，而你们则是我们惟一的儿子。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4404');"><p>"You have learned the words of the vow. Think carefully before you say them, for once you have taken the black, there is no turning back. The penalty for desertion is death." The Old Bear paused for a moment before he said, "Are there any among you who wish to leave our company? If so, go now, and no one shall think the less of you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4404" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们已经听过了誓言内容。在发誓前请仔细考虑，一旦穿上黑衣，便永无退路。背离职守是惟一死刑。”熊老暂停片刻，然后继续，“你们之中有没有人想离开?如果有，现在就走，我们绝不会因此而看轻你。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4405');"><p>No one moved.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4405" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>无人移动。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4406');"><p>"Well and good," said Mormont. "You may take your vows here at evenfall, before Septon Celladar and the first of your order. Do any of you keep to the old gods?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4406" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“很好，”莫尔蒙道，“傍晚时分，你们回到这里，当着赛勒达修士和你们所属组织首席的面宣誓。你们中有信仰旧神的吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4407');"><p>Jon stood. "I do, my lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4407" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩站起来。“有的，大人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4408');"><p>"I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your uncle did," Mormont said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4408" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想你或许情愿跟你叔叔一样，在心树之下宣誓。”莫尔蒙说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4409');"><p>"Yes, my lord," Jon said. The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4409" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，大人。”琼恩道。圣堂的诸神与他无关。先民的血液依旧流淌在史塔克家人体内。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4410');"><p>He heard Grenn whispering behind him. "There’s no godswood here. Is there? I never saw a godswood."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4410" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他听见葛兰在背后低语：“这里没有神木林罢，对不对? 我从来没发现。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4411');"><p>"You wouldn’t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow," Pyp whispered back.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4411" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你啊，就算一群野牛迎面冲来，等它们把你踩进雪里，你也没发现。”派普悄声回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4412');"><p>"I would so," Grenn insisted. "I’d see them a long way off."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4412" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我会啦，”葛兰坚持，“我大老远就会看见它们。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4413');"><p>Mormont himself confirmed Grenn’s doubts. "Castle Black has no need of a godswood. Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age, long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea. You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot, and mayhap your gods as well."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4413" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙倒是证实了葛兰的疑虑。“黑城堡无需神木林。鬼影森林早在安达尔人将七神带过狭海前的黎明纪元便已耸立在长城之外，至今依然。由此向北半里格你会找到一片鱼梁木，或许也会找到你的神。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4414');"><p>"My lord." The voice made Jon glance back in surprise. Samwell Tarly was on his feet. The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic. "Might I?.?.?.?might I go as well? To say my words at this heart tree?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4414" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，”琼恩惊讶地回头，看见肥胖的山姆威尔•塔利站了起来，将满是汗水的手掌在衣服上抹了抹。“我能……我能不能跟他一起去?到心树下宣誓?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4415');"><p>"Does House Tarly keep the old gods too?" Mormont asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4415" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“塔利家族莫非信奉旧神?”莫尔蒙问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4416');"><p>"No, my lord," Sam replied in a thin, nervous voice. The high officers frightened him, Jon knew, the Old Bear most of all. "I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill, as my father was, and his father, and all the Tarlys for a thousand years."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4416" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不是的，大人，”山姆用尖细而紧张的声音回答。琼恩知道官员们很叫他害怕，熊老尤甚。 “我在七神的荣光照耀下，在角陵的圣堂里举行了命名仪式。我父亲如此，他的父亲亦如此，千年来塔利家族世代如此。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4417');"><p>"Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?" wondered Ser Jaremy Rykker.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4417" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那么……你为何要抛弃令尊和你家族长久以来信仰的诸神呢?”杰瑞米•莱克爵士很好奇。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4418');"><p>"The Night’s Watch is my House now," Sam said. "The Seven have never answered my prayers. Perhaps the old gods will."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4418" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如今我以守夜人军团为家，”山姆信誓旦旦地说，“七神从未回应我的祈祷，或许旧神会呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4419');"><p>"As you wish, boy," Mormont said. Sam took his seat again, as did Jon. "We have placed each of you in an order, as befits our need and your own strengths and skills." Bowen Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper. The Lord Commander unrolled it and began to read. "Haider, to the builders," he began. Haider gave a stiff nod of approval. "Grenn, to the rangers. Albett, to the builders. Pypar, to the rangers." Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears. "Samwell, to the stewards." Sam sagged with relief, mopping at his brow with,a scrap of silk. "Matthar, to the rangers. Dareon, to the stewards. Todder, to the rangers. Jon, to the stewards."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4419" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那就这样，孩子。”莫尔蒙说。山姆和琼恩返身坐下。“依照我们的需求，以及你们自身的能力和技巧，你们将被分配到不同的岗位。”波文•马尔锡前跨一步，交给他一张纸。总司令摊开纸，“霍德，加入工匠，”他开始念，只见霍德僵硬而激动地点了点头，“葛兰，加入游骑兵。阿贝特，加入工匠。派普尔，加入游骑兵，”派普看看琼恩，兴奋地摇耳朵。“山姆威尔，加入事务官。”山姆如释重负地叹了口气，忙掏出一块丝巾擦干额头。“梅沙，加入游骑兵。戴利恩，加入事务官。陶德，加入游骑兵。琼恩，加人事务官。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4420');"><p>The stewards? For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard. Mormont must have read it wrong. He started to rise, to open his mouth, to tell them there had been a mistake?.?.?.?and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him, eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian, and he knew.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4420" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>事务官?一时之间琼恩简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。莫尔蒙一定是念错了。他正准备站起来申诉，告诉他们弄错了……却看见艾里沙爵士正审视着自己，双眼闪亮犹如黑曜石块，他顿时恍然大悟。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4421');"><p>The Old Bear rolled up the paper. "Your firsts will instruct you in your duties. May all the gods preserve you, brothers." The Lord Commander favored them with a half bow, and took his leave. Ser Alliser went with him, a thin smile on his face. Jon had never seen the master-at-arms took quite so happy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4421" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>熊老卷起纸。“你们各自的首席长官会介绍你们的职责所在。弟兄们，愿天上诸神眷顾你们。”总司令向他们微微颔首致意，便即离开。艾里沙爵士跟他一道，脸上挂着一抹浅浅的微笑。琼恩从没见教头这么开心过。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4422');"><p>"Rangers with me," Ser Jaremy Rykker called when they were gone. Pyp was staring at Jon as he got slowly to his feet. His ears were red. Grenn, grinning broadly, did not seem to realize that anything was amiss. Matt and Toad fell in beside them, and they followed Ser Jaremy from the sept.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4422" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“游骑兵跟我来。”等他们走后，杰瑞米•莱克爵士喊。派普慢慢站立，眼睛却盯着琼恩，双耳通红。葛兰开心地嘻笑，丝毫末察觉有何不对。梅沙和陶德走到他们旁边，跟随杰瑞米爵士离开圣堂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4423');"><p>"Builders," announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck. Haider and Albett trailed out after him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4423" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“工匠。”生着灯笼下巴的奥赛尔•亚威克随即宣布，然后霍德和阿贝特也跟他走了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4424');"><p>Jon looked around him in sick disbelief. Maester Aemon’s blind eyes were raised toward the light he could not see. The septon was arranging crystals on the altar. Only Sam and Darcon remained on the benches; a fat boy, a singer?.?.?.?and him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4424" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩满心嫌恶地环顾四周。只见伊蒙学士的盲眼正朝他看不见的光源望去，修士正在那里整理祭坛的水晶。山姆和戴利恩还坐在板凳上，一个胖子，一个歌手……还有他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4425');"><p>Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together. "Samwell, you will assist Maester Aemon in the rookery and library. Chett is going to the kennels, to help with the hounds. You shall have his cell, so as to be close to the maester night and day. I trust you will take good care of him. He is very old and very precious to us.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4425" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>总务长波文•马尔锡搓搓他的胖手。“山姆威尔，你去帮伊蒙学士管理鸟笼和图书室。齐特已被调去犬栏照顾猎狗，你就住他那间屋，以便随时照顾学士的起居。希望你好好工作，他老人家年事已高，对我们更是弥足珍贵。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4426');"><p>"Dareon, I am told that you sang at many a high lord’s table and shared their meat and mead. We are sending you to Eastwatch. It may be your palate will be some help to Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys come trading. We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish, and the quality of the olive oil we’re getting has been frightful, Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive, he will keep you busy between ships."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4426" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“戴利恩，我听说你在不少高官老爷面前表演过，也见过一点世面，所以我们派你去东海望协助卡特•派克。等商船前来交易时，你的本领或许能派上用场。近来腌牛肉和咸鱼的价格高得惊人，橄榄油的品臼则是烂得吓人。你到了之后先找波卡斯，他会交代你如何与商船交舒。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4427');"><p>Marsh turned his smile on Jon. "Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward, Jon. You’ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers, in the Lord Commander’s tower."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4427" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>马尔锡微笑着转头望向琼恩。“琼恩，莫尔蒙司令特别要你当他的私人事务官。你将睡在他卧室楼下的那间房里，住在司令塔里面。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4428');"><p>"And what will my duties be?" Jon asked sharply. "Will I serve the Lord Commander’s meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4428" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“请问我的职责又是什么?”琼恩尖锐地问，“是不是要帮总司令打理三餐，伺候他更衣，为他打热水洗澡?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4429');"><p>"Certainly." Marsh frowned at Jon’s tone. "And you will run his messages, keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4429" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有错。”马尔锡听了琼恩的口气，皱起眉头。“除此之外，你还要替他跑腿，为他房间生火，每天换洗床单和毛毯，以及承担总司令要你做的其他事情。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4430');"><p>"Do you take me for a servant?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4430" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你当我是下人么?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4431');"><p>"No," Maester Aemon said, from the back of the sept. Clydas helped him stand. "We took you for a man of the Night’s Watch?.?.?.?but perhaps we were wrong in that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4431" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，”圣堂后方的伊蒙学士说。克莱达斯扶他站起来。“我们当你是守夜人的汉子……不过或许我们错看了你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4432');"><p>It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out. Was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days? "May I go?" he asked stiffly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4432" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩竭尽所能地克臸自己，方才没有掉头离去。难道他就要像女孩子家一样整天切奶油，缝衣服度过一生? “我可以离开吗?”他僵硬地问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4433');"><p>"As you wish," Bowen Marsh responded.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4433" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“去罢。”波文•马尔锡回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4434');"><p>Dareon and Sam left with him. They descended to the yard in silence. Outside, Jon looked up at the Wall shining in the sun, the melting ice creeping down its side in a hundred thin fingers. Jon’s rage was such that he would have smashed it all in an instant, and the world be damned.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4434" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>戴利恩和山姆与他一道离去。他们默默地走回广场，琼恩抬头看着阳光下闪耀的长城，融化的冰水仿如千百根纤细的手指向下流淌。他恼怒至极，恨不得立刻就把整座长城敲个粉碎，管他世界死活。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4435');"><p>"Jon," Samwell Tarly said excitedly. "Wait. Don’t you see what they’re doing?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4435" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“琼恩”山姆威尔•塔利兴奋地说，“等等我们，你看不出他们的用意吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4436');"><p>Jon turned on him in a fury. "I see Ser Alliser’s bloody hand, that’s all I see. He wanted to shame me, and he has."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4436" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩大怒转头。“我只看出这是艾里沙爵士搞的鬼。他想羞辱我，这下他可遂心愿了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4437');"><p>Dareon gave him a look. "The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, Sam, but not for Lord Snow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4437" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>戴利恩看了他一眼。“山姆，叫你我这种人当当总务不成问题，但雪诺大人厉害着呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4438');"><p>"I’m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you," Jon blazed back. "It’s not fair!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4438" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“废话，不论使剑、骑马我都比你们行，”琼恩火冒三丈地反击，“这太不公平了!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4439');"><p>"Fair?" Dareon sneered. "The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day she was born. She pulled me through the window, and you talk to me of fair?" He walked off.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4439" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“公平?”戴利恩嗤之以鼻。“当年那小妞脱得精光，活像刚打娘胎里出生一般等着我，还是她把我从窗户里拉进去的。你倒是告诉我什么叫做公平?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4440');"><p>"There is no shame in being a steward," Sam said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4440" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当个事务官没什么可耻的。”山姆说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4441');"><p>"Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man’s smallclothes?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4441" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你要我洗一辈子老头的内衣裤吗?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4442');"><p>"The old man is Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch," Sam reminded him. "You’ll be with him day and night. Yes, you’ll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh, but you’ll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle. You’ll be as close to him as his shadow. You’ll know everything, be a part of everything?.?.?.?and the Lord Steward said Mormont asked for you himself!
</p></origin><translate id="div_4442" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这老头可是堂堂守夜人军团总司令，”山姆提醒他，“而你则会日夜跟他相处。没错，你是得帮他倒酒，换洗被单，但你也会替他送信，随他参加会议，打仗的时候当他的侍从。你会跟他形影不离，大小事务你都会知情，甚至能施加影响……更何况总务长说是莫尔蒙特别指定要你的!”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4443');"><p>"When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court. When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell, he made me come. Later, though, he started to take Dickon and leave me at home, and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences, so long as Dickon was there. He wanted his heir at his side, don’t you see? To watch and listen and learn from all he did. I’ll wager that’s why Lord Mormont requested you, Jon. What else could it be? He wants to groom you for command!"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4444');"><p>Jon was taken aback. It was true, Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils back at Winterfell. Could Sam be right? Even a bastard could rise high in the Night’s Watch, they said. "I never asked for this," he said stubbornly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4444" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩完全愣住了。的确，以前在临冬城的时候，艾德公爵便常要罗柏出席各种会议。难道山姆说的是真的?人家总说在守夜人部队里，加便私生子也可升至高位。“我又不想这样。”他嘴硬地说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4445');"><p>"None of us are here for asking," Sam reminded him.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4447');"><p>Craven or not, Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man. On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns, Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive. You’re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you. He’d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children; on the Wall, you grew up or you died.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4447" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>无论他算不算懦夫，山姆威尔•塔利都像个男子汉一样有了接受命运的勇气。在长城守军里，想得到什么样的待遇，就得证明自己有什么样的本事，琼恩最后一次见到活生生的班扬•史塔克的那天夜里，他曾这么说，你还不是游骑兵，你只是个臻气未脱，身上还残留着夏天气味的小鬼。据说私生子成长得比别人都快，在长城上，你若不快快成长，就只有死路一条。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4448');"><p>Jon let out a deep sigh. "You have the right of it. I was acting the boy."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4449');"><p>"Then you’ll stay and say your words with me?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4449" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那你会留下来跟我一起宣誓哕?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4450');"><p>"The old gods will be expecting us." He made himself smile.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4450" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“旧神正在等着我们哪。”他逼自己挤出一丝微笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4451');"><p>They set out late that afternoon. The Wall had no gates as such, neither here at Castle Black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles. They led their horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice, cold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage twisted and turned. Three times their way was blocked by iron bars, and they had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured them. Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on him as he waited behind the Lord Steward. The air was colder than a tomb, and more still. He felt a strange relief when they reemerged into the afternoon light on the north side of the Wall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4451" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们于当日下午出发。长城沿线三百里没有一座城门，他们得牵马走进穿透冰层的狭窄隧道。路径曲折蜿蜒，黑暗而冰冷的冰墙无时无刻不向他们逼近。他们经过三道拦路铁栏，每次都得停下脚步，让波文•马尔锡取出大串钥匙，打开锁住栅栏的厚重铁链。等候总务长开门时，琼恩感到无比庞然的重量朝他压来。这里的空气阴冷赛过墓穴，且更为凝滞。等他们终于抵达长城以北，重见午后的阳光，顿时感觉到一股奇异的舒畅。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4452');"><p>Sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively. "The wildlings?.?.?.?they wouldn’t?.?.?.?they’d never dare come this close to the Wall. Would they?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4452" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>面对突如其来的强光，山姆眨眨眼，担忧地环顾四周。“野人……他们不会……他们不敢跑到离长城这么近的地方来，是不是?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4453');"><p>"They never have." Jon climbed into his saddle. When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had mounted, Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled. Ghost came loping out of the tunnel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4453" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“从来不敢。”琼恩翻身上马。等波文•马尔锡和护送他们的游骑兵都上了马，琼恩把两根手指伸进嘴巴，吹声口哨，白灵从地道里应声奔出。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4454');"><p>The Lord Steward’s garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf. "Do you mean to take that beast?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4454" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>总务长的坐骑嘶叫着退开。“你要带这野兽一起去?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4455');"><p>"Yes, my lord," Jon said. Ghost’s head lifted. He seemed to taste the air. In the blink of an eye he was off, racing across the broad, weed-choked field to vanish in the trees.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4455" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，大人。”琼恩说。白灵抬起头，似乎在体验塞外的空气。然后，只一眨眼功夫他便冲了出去，驰骋过野草蔓生的广阔平原，转瞬间消失在远方的树林里。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4456');"><p>Once they had entered the forest, they were in a different world. Jon had often hunted with his father and Jory and his brother Robb. He knew the wolfswood around Winterfell as well as any man. The haunted forest was much the same, and yet the feel of it was very different.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4456" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一进森林，他们就恍如置身另一世界。从前琼恩常跟父亲、乔里和罗柏一道外出打猎。对临冬城外的狼林了若指掌。鬼影森林在样貌上大致相同，但却有种极端殊异的氛围。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4457');"><p>Perhaps it was all in the knowing. They had ridden past the end of the world; somehow that changed everything. Every shadow seemed darker, every sound more ominous. The trees pressed close and shut out the light of the setting sun. A thin crust of snow cracked beneath the hooves of their horses, with a sound like breaking bones. When the wind set the leaves to rustling, it was like a chilly finger tracing a path up Jon’s spine. The Wall was at their backs, and only the gods knew what lay ahead.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4457" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这或许就是一种感觉罢。想到已经越过世界的尽头，一切便都不一样了。同样的影子，此地更显阴暗，同样的声音』匕地更觉不祥。树与树之间靠得很近，遮蔽了渐落的斜舐阳光。地表的薄雪在马蹄下碎裂，声音脆如断骨。朔风吹拂，落叶沙沙作响，像有无数根冰凉手指沿着背脊缓缓而上。长城已在后方，前路一片迷离，诸神才知通往何方。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4458');"><p>The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination, a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle. Jon drew in a breath, and he saw Sam Tarly staring. Even in the wolfswood, you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove of nine was unheard of. The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves, bloodred on top, black rot beneath. The wide smooth trunks were bone pale, and nine faces stared inward. The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby. Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle. "This is a sacred place, we will not defile it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4458" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当他们抵达目的地时，夕阳已没入树梢。这是森林深处的一小块空地，九棵鱼梁木长在一起，粗略组成一个圆。琼恩深吸一口气，抬头发现山姆也睁大了眼睛。即便在北方，即便在狼林，你也找不到这种白色的树会两三棵长在一起，九棵简直闻所未闻。林地铺满落叶，上层血红，下面则是腐朽的黑色。宽而平滑的树干如枯骨般苍白，九张脸向圆心凝视，眼睛部位干涸的树汁红硬宛如宝石。波文•马尔锡命令他们将马匹留在圆圈之外。“这是神圣之地，我们不可亵渎。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4459');"><p>When they entered the grove, Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn. No two were quite alike. "They’re watching us," he whispered. "The old gods."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4459" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>走进树丛后，山姆威尔•塔利慢慢地转头审视每一张脸。它们全都不一样。“远古诸神，”他悄声说，“他们正看着我们呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4460');"><p>"Yes." Jon knelt, and Sam knelt beside him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4460" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对啊。”琼恩单膝跪下，山姆也跪在他身边。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4461');"><p>They said the words together, as the last light faded in the west and grey day became black night.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4461" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在最后一线日光沉落西天，灰暗的白昼转为黑夜的时刻，他们齐声念出誓言。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4462');"><p>"Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow," they recited, their voices filling the twilit grove. "Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4462" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“倾听我的誓言，做我的见证。”他们的朗诵充斥暮色中的树林，“长夜将至，我从今开始守望，至死方休。我将不娶妻，不封地，不生子。我将不戴宝冠，不争荣宠。我将尽忠职守，生死于斯。我是黑暗中的利剑，长城上的守卫，抵御寒冷的烈焰，破晓时分的光线，唤醒眠者的号角，守护王国的坚盾。我将生命与荣耀献给守夜人，今夜如此，夜夜皆然。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4463');"><p>The woods fell silent. "You knelt as boys," Bowen Marsh intoned solemnly. "Rise now as men of the Night’s Watch."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4463" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>森林一片寂然。“你们跪下时尚为孩童，”波文•马尔锡肃穆地吟诵，“起来吧，守夜人的汉子。”

The rangers gathered round to offer smiles and congratulations, all but the gnarled old forester Dywen. "Best we be starting back, m’lord," he said to Bowen Marsh. "Dark’s falling, and there’s something in the smell o’ the night that I mislike."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4464" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩伸手拉山姆起身。随行的游骑兵凑过来微笑恭喜，惟独满脸皱纹的老林务官戴文例外。 “大人，咱们最好赶紧上路，”他对波文•马尔锡说，“天黑了，这儿有些味道我不喜欢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4465');"><p>And suddenly Ghost was back, stalking softly between two weirwoods. White fur and red eyes, Jon realized, disquieted. Like the trees?.?.?.?
