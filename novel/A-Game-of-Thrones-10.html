</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_745');"><p>Somewhere in the great stone maze of Winterfell, a wolf howled. The sound hung over the castle like a flag of mourning.
</p></origin><translate id="div_745" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>临冬城堡的巨石迷宫深处，传来一声狼嚎。嚎叫声在堡垒间悬荡，如同一面哀悼的旗臶。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_746');"><p>Tyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug and warm. Something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind, running naked before the pack.
</p></origin><translate id="div_746" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>虽然图书馆里温暖舒适，提利昂听了却不禁从书堆里抬首，颤抖起来。狼嚎中有种神秘莫测的力量，将他硬生生自现实抽离，弃置于一片广寒的阴郁森林，浑身赤裸，在恶狼追逐下亡命奔逃。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_747');"><p>When the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading, a hundred-year-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-dead maester. He covered a yawn with the back of his hand. His reading lamp was flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked through the high windows. He had been at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion Lannister was not much a one for sleeping.
</p></origin><translate id="div_747" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当冰原狼的嚎叫声再度传来，提利昂终于忍不住阖上他正在读的书，那是一部探究季节更迭的百年古籍，出自某位早已长眠地下的老学士之手。他打了个呵欠，用手背微微掩住嘴巴。晨色自高窗缝里泄进图书馆，他的写字灯火光摇曳，灯油已荆他又整夜没睡，然而这也不是什么新鲜事，提利昂•兰尼斯特向来不是个需要大量睡眠的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_748');"><p>His legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head pillowed on an open book in front of him. Tyrion glanced at the title. A life of the Grand Maester Aethelmure, no wonder. "Chayle," he said softly. The young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain. "I’m off to break my fast. See that you return the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the Valyrian scrolls, the parchment is very dry. Ayrmidon’s Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is the only complete copy I’ve ever seen." Chayle gaped at him, still half-asleep. Patiently, Tyrion repeated his instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks.
</p></origin><translate id="div_748" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他挪动僵硬酸麻的双脚下了长凳，稍事按摩之后，跛着脚走到桌边。修士正趴在桌上，轻声打鼾，头枕在面前一本敞开的大书上。提利昂瞄瞄书名，原来是《伊萨穆尔国师传记》，难怪他会看到睡着。“柴尔，”他轻声唤道，年轻修士陡地惊醒，困惑地眨眨眼，象征他身份的水晶在银项链上晃动。“我去吃早餐，记得帮我把书放回架上。不过动作轻点，这些瓦雷利亚卷轴的羊皮纸很脆弱。伊弥顿的《战争兵器》是一部很稀有的书，我这辈子只看见你这份抄本。”柴尔还没完全清醒，朝他打了个大呵欠。提利昂耐着性子又重复了一辫，然后拍拍修士的肩膀，让他去工作。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_749');"><p>Outside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower. It was slow going; the steps were cut high and narrow, while his legs were short and twisted. The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of Winterfell, but the men were already hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Clegane’s rasping voice drifted up to him. "The boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be quicker about it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_749" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>走出门外，提利昂深吸一口清晨的冷空气，接着费力地走下环绕藏书塔那一级级陡峭的螺旋梯。阶梯高窄，他的脚却短小畸形又扭曲。旭日还没高过临冬城城墙，但校场里已有不少人开始练习。桑铎•克里冈刺耳的声音传了过来：“那小子拖拖拉拉地还不断气，早点死了不挺干脆？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_750');"><p>Tyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires swarmed around them. "At least he dies quietly," the prince replied. "It’s the wolf that makes the noise. I could scarce sleep last night."
</p></origin><translate id="div_750" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂往下看，看到“猎狗”站在年轻的乔佛里身旁，周围簇拥着一群侍从。“至少他没吭半声，”王子说，“吵的是那只狼，吵得我昨晚快没法睡了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_751');"><p>Clegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his head. "I could silence the creature, if it please you," he said through his open visor. His boy placed a longsword in his hand. He tested the weight of it, slicing at the cold morning air. Behind him, the yard rang to the clangor of steel on steel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_751" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>克里冈的随从为他戴上黑甲头盔，他高大的身躯在硬土地上拉下长长的影子。“假如您高兴，我去叫那只东西闭嘴。”他透过打开的面罩说。这时他的随从将长剑递上，他试了试剑的重量，在清晨的冷空气里比划了几下。在他身后，广场上传来金属交击的声音。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_752');"><p>The notion seemed to delight the prince. "Send a dog to kill a dog!" he exclaimed. "Winterfell is so infested with wolves, the Starks would never miss one."
</p></origin><translate id="div_752" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王子听了这主意似乎很高兴。“叫狗去杀狗！”他叫道，“反正临冬城里多的是狼，少它一条史塔克家也不会发现。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_753');"><p>Tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard. "I beg to differ, nephew," he said. "The Starks can count past six. Unlike some princes I might name."
</p></origin><translate id="div_753" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂跳过最后一级阶梯，下到场子。“好外甥，真不好意思，”他说，“史塔克家的人会数数，不像某位王子，连六都算不到。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_754');"><p>Joffrey had the grace at least to blush.
</p></origin><translate id="div_754" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔佛里至少知道脸红。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_755');"><p>"A voice from nowhere," Sandor said. He peered through his helm, looking this way and that. "Spirits of the air!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_755" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有声音，”桑铎道，他故意从面罩里向外瞧，左顾右盼地道，“莫非是空气中的精灵！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_756');"><p>The prince laughed, as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummer’s farce. Tyrion was used to it. "Down here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_756" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王子笑了，每次他的贴身护卫作假演戏，都能把他逗得咯咯笑。提利昂早就不以为意。“下面。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_757');"><p>The tall man peered down at the ground, and pretended to notice him. "The little lord Tyrion," he said. "My pardons. I did not see you standing there."
</p></origin><translate id="div_757" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>高大的桑铎往下瞟了一眼，然后假装刚发现似的道：“原来是提利昂小少爷，”他说，“请您原谅，我方才没见您站这儿呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_758');"><p>"I am in no mood for your insolence today." Tyrion turned to his nephew. "Joffrey, it is past time you called on Lord Eddard and his lady, to offer them your comfort."
</p></origin><translate id="div_758" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我现在没心情跟你计较，”提利昂转向他的外甥，“乔佛里，你快去拜见史塔克公爵和夫人，不然就晚了。你要向他们表达你的哀悼，请他们宽心。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_759');"><p>Joffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look. "What good will my comfort do them?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_759" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔佛里听罢立刻露出少不更事的暴躁脸色：“我请他们宽心有什么用？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_760');"><p>"None," Tyrion said. "Yet it is expected of you. Your absence has been noted."
</p></origin><translate id="div_760" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一点用都没有，”提利昂回答，“但这是应尽的礼数，不然大家会注意到你刻意缺席。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_761');"><p>"The Stark boy is nothing to me," Joffrey said. "I cannot abide the wailing of women."
</p></origin><translate id="div_761" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那史塔克小孩算什么东西，”乔佛里说，“我可不想去听老女人哭哭啼啼。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_762');"><p>Tyrion Lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face. The boy’s cheek began to redden.
</p></origin><translate id="div_762" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂•兰尼斯特踮起脚尖，狠狠地摔了侄子一个大耳光，男孩的脸颊立刻红肿起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_763');"><p>"One word," Tyrion said, "and I will hit you again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_763" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你敢再说一句，”提利昂道，“我就再赏你一记耳光。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_764');"><p>"I’m going to tell Mother!" Joffrey exclaimed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_764" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我要去告诉妈妈！”乔佛里喊。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_765');"><p>Tyrion hit him again. Now both cheeks flamed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_765" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂又打了他一个巴掌，这下子他两边脸颊都一般通红了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_766');"><p>"You tell your mother," Tyrion told him. "But first you get yourself to Lord and Lady Stark, and you fall to your knees in front of them, and you tell them how very sorry you are, and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers go with them. Do you understand? Do you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_766" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“随你去跟她怎么说，”提利昂告诉他，“但你首先给我去乖乖拜见史塔克公爵夫妇，我要你在他们面前跪下，说你自己感到非常遗憾，说即便是最微不足道的事情，只要能让他们宽心，你都愿意赴汤蹈火在所不辞，最后还要为他们献上你最虔诚的祝祷，你听懂了没有？听懂了没有？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_767');"><p>The boy looked as though he was going to cry. Instead, he managed a weak nod. Then he turned and fled headlong from the yard, holding his cheek. Tyrion watched him run.
</p></origin><translate id="div_767" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>男孩一副泫然欲泣的模样，但还是勉为其难地点点头，然后转身捂着脸颊，横冲直撞地跑离广常提利昂目送他远去。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_768');"><p>A shadow fell across his face. He turned to find Clegane looming overhead like a cliff. His soot-dark armor seemed to blot out the sun. He had lowered the visor on his helm. It was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound, fearsome to behold, but Tyrion had always thought it a great improvement over Clegane’s hideously burned face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_768" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一团黑影突然笼罩住他，他转过头，发现高大的克里冈正如同陡峭绝壁般阴恺恺地朝他逼近，煤烟色的黑甲宛如灿烂阳光中的污点。他已经放下了头盔上的面罩，面罩的形状是一只咧嘴咆哮的凶狠猎犬，令人怵目惊心，不过提利昂认为比起克里冈那张烧得稀烂的脸，这面罩已算美得太多。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_769');"><p>"The prince will remember that, little lord," the Hound warned him. The helm turned his laugh into a hollow rumble.
</p></origin><translate id="div_769" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，王子不会轻易忘记您刚才对他的举动的。”猎狗警告他，克里冈的声音从头盔里传来，原本的狞笑成了空洞的轰隆。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_770');"><p>"I pray he does," Tyrion Lannister replied. "If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him." He glanced around the courtyard. "Do you know where I might find my brother?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_770" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他记得最好，”提利昂•兰尼斯特回答，“哪天要是他忘了，你这条狗可要好好提醒他。”他环视广场，又问：“你知道我哥哥在哪儿？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_771');"><p>"Breaking fast with the queen."
</p></origin><translate id="div_771" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“正与王后共进早餐。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_772');"><p>"Ah," Tyrion said. He gave Sandor Clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as his stunted legs would carry him, whistling. He pitied the first knight to try the Hound today. The man did have a temper.
</p></origin><translate id="div_772" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊哈。”提利昂道，他半敷衍地朝桑铎•克里冈点头答谢，然后提起那双畸形的腿，尽全力快步离开，心里可怜今天首位与猎狗过招的骑士，那家伙正在气头上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_773');"><p>A cold, cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the Guest House. Jaime sat at table with Cersei and the children, talking in low, hushed voices.
</p></origin><translate id="div_773" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>客房的早餐室里摆了一桌冰冷而了无生气的餐点，詹姆、瑟曦和公主王子们坐在一起，低声交头接耳。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_774');"><p>"Is Robert still abed?" Tyrion asked as he seated himself, uninvited, at the table.
</p></origin><translate id="div_774" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃还没起床？”提利昂没等他们招呼，径自在餐桌前坐下。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_775');"><p>His sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was born. "The king has not slept at all," she told him. "He is with Lord Eddard. He has taken their sorrow deeply to heart."
</p></origin><translate id="div_775" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>姐姐用那种打从他出生起便惯有的鄙视眼神瞟了他一眼：“国王根本没睡。他整晚和史塔克大人在一起，难过得心都快碎了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_776');"><p>"He has a large heart, our Robert," Jaime said with a lazy smile. There was very little that Jaime took seriously. Tyrion knew that about his brother, and forgave it. During all the terrible long years of his childhood, only Jaime had ever shown him the smallest measure of affection or respect, and for that Tyrion was willing to forgive him most anything.
</p></origin><translate id="div_776" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“咱们的好劳勃那颗心倒是挺大的。”詹姆慵懒地微笑。提利昂很清楚哥哥那对凡事都蛮不在乎的个性，因此不想跟他计较。自己过去那段惨痛而漫长的童年岁月里，只有詹姆对他有过那么一丝感情和尊重，光为这一点，提利昂就不愿跟他计较任何事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_777');"><p>A servant approached. "Bread," Tyrion told him, "and two of those little fish, and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down. Oh, and some bacon. Burn it until it turns black." The man bowed and moved off. Tyrion turned back to his siblings. Twins, male and female. They looked very much the part this morning. Both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes. Their blond curls were all a fashionable tumble, and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats.
</p></origin><translate id="div_777" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>侍者迎上前来。“我要面包，”提利昂告诉他，“两条这种小鱼，再配上一杯上好的黑啤酒。噢，还要几片培根，记得煎焦一点。”仆人鞠了个躬告退之后，提利昂转头面对他的兄姐。这对孪生兄妹今天都穿着深绿色的衣服，正好搭配他们眼瞳的颜色；金色的卷发呈现出时髦的波浪，金饰在他们的手腕、指间和颈项上闪闪发亮，两人看起来真像一个模子刻出的雕塑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_778');"><p>Tyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and decided that he would rather not know. Bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day. Another him was a thought too dreadful to contemplate.
</p></origin><translate id="div_778" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂不禁暗忖，若自己也有个双胞兄弟，不知会是什么样？不过想归想，他决定还是不要成真的好。每天在镜子前面对自己已经够糟，要再多出个长得和他一副德行的人，那还了得？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_779');"><p>Prince Tommen spoke up. "Do you have news of Bran, Uncle?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_779" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时托曼王子开口问：“舅舅，你知道布兰现在怎么样了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_780');"><p>"I stopped by the sickroom last night," Tyrion announced. "There was no change. The maester thought that a hopeful sign."
</p></origin><translate id="div_780" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我昨晚经过病房时，”提利昂回答，“病情既没恶化也没好转，学士认为还有希望。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_781');"><p>"I don’t want Brandon to die," Tommen said timorously. He was a sweet boy. Not like his brother, but then Jaime and Tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod themselves.
</p></origin><translate id="div_781" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我希望布兰登不要死。”托曼怯生生地说。他是个可爱的孩子，一点也不像他哥哥。不过话说回来，詹姆和提利昂两人也没什么共通之处。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_782');"><p>"Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well," Jaime mused. "One of the hostages murdered by Targaryen. It seems to be an unlucky name."
</p></origin><translate id="div_782" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“史塔克大人有个哥哥也叫布兰登，”詹姆饶富兴味地说，“后来作人臼被坦格利安家给杀了。看来这名字还真不吉利。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_783');"><p>"Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely," Tyrion said. The servant brought his plate. He ripped off a chunk of black bread.
</p></origin><translate id="div_783" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“呵，还不至于不吉利到那种程度啦。”提利昂道。此时侍者送来了餐点，他随即撕下一大块黑麦面包。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_784');"><p>Cersei was studying him warily. "What do you mean?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_784" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>瑟曦正满怀戒心地盯着他瞧。“你这话什么意思？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_785');"><p>Tyrion gave her a crooked smile. "Why, only that Tommen may get his wish. The maester thinks the boy may yet live." He took a sip of beer.
</p></origin><translate id="div_785" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂不怀好意地朝她笑笑：“没别的意思，只是恭祝托曼如愿以偿啰。老学士说那孩子活下来的机会很大，所以……”说完他啜了口啤酒。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_786');"><p>Myrcella gave a happy gasp, and Tommen smiled nervously, but it was not the children Tyrion was watching. The glance that passed between Jaime and Cersei lasted no more than a second, but he did not miss it. Then his sister dropped her gaze to the table. "That is no mercy. These northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain."
</p></origin><translate id="div_786" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>弥赛听了高兴得惊叫出声，托曼也露出腼腆的微笑，然而提利昂注意的却不是他俩的反应。詹姆和瑟曦交换眼神的时间不过一秒，但他可没错过。接着他姐姐低下头，视线垂到餐桌上。“老天真残忍。这些北方的神，竟让一个年幼的孩子苟延残喘，实在是太狠毒了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_787');"><p>"What were the maester’s words?" Jaime asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_787" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“老学士具体是怎么说的？”詹姆问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_788');"><p>The bacon crunched when he bit into it. Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said, "He thinks that if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already. It has been four days with no change."
</p></origin><translate id="div_788" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂咬了口培根，发出松脆的声响。他若有所思地嚼了一会儿方才开口：“他认为那孩子要死早就死了，不会这样拖了四天毫无动静。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_789');"><p>"Will Bran get better, Uncle?" little Myrcella asked. She had all of her mother’s beauty, and none of her nature.
</p></origin><translate id="div_789" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“舅舅，布兰会好起来么？”小弥赛菈又问。她从母亲那里继承了所有的美貌，却丝毫没有半点瑟曦狠毒的性格。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_790');"><p>"His back is broken, little one," Tyrion told her. "The fall shattered his legs as well. They keep him alive with honey and water, or he would starve to death. Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_790" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小宝贝，他的背摔断了，”提利昂告诉她，“两只脚也都残废。他们现在喂他蜂蜜和开水，不然他会活活饿死。也许等他醒来之后，可以吃东西，但却一辈子都别想走路了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_791');"><p>"If he wakes," Cersei repeated. "Is that likely?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_791" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“等他醒来，”瑟曦重复了一辫，“你觉得有可能？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_792');"><p>"The gods alone know," Tyrion told her. "The maester only hopes." He chewed some more bread. "I would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive. The creature is outside his window day and night, howling. Every time they chase it away, it returns. The maester said they closed the window once, to shut out the noise, and Bran seemed to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger."
</p></origin><translate id="div_792" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“只有天上诸神知道，”提利昂答道，“老师傅只是揣测罢了。”他又咬了几口面包，“不过我敢说那孩子的狼是支持他活下去的原动力，它每天不分昼夜守在窗外，叫个不停，怎么赶也赶不走。老师傅说他们曾关上窗子，以为如此便能减少噪音，谁知布兰的情况却立刻恶化，后来他们打开窗户，他又转危为安。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_793');"><p>The queen shuddered. "There is something unnatural about those animals," she said. "They are dangerous. I will not have any of them coming south with us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_793" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王后颤声道：“那些动物古怪极了，”她说，“瞧那模样就很危险，我绝不准它们随我们回南方去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_794');"><p>Jaime said, "You’ll have a hard time stopping them, sister. They follow those girls everywhere."
</p></origin><translate id="div_794" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>詹姆道：“好姐姐，我看你是阻止不了的，它们和女孩可是形影不离呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_795');"><p>Tyrion started on his fish. "Are you leaving soon, then?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_795" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂开始吃他的烤鱼。“这么说你们很快就要动身了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_796');"><p>"Not near soon enough," Cersei said. Then she frowned. "Are we leaving?" she echoed. "What about you? Gods, don’t tell me you are staying here?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_796" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我还嫌不够快。”瑟曦说。接着她突然皱眉，“’我们‘？那你呢？诸神在上，别跟我说你想留在这种鬼地方。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_797');"><p>Tyrion shrugged. "Benjen Stark is returning to the Night’s Watch with his brother’s bastard. I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of."
</p></origin><translate id="div_797" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂耸耸肩：“班扬•史塔克要带他哥哥的私生子返回守夜人军团，我打算跟他们一起走，好亲眼见识见识传说中的绝境长城。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_802');"><p>"He will if Robert commands it," Tyrion said. "And Robert will command it. There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case."
</p></origin><translate id="div_802" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果劳勃下了命令，他肯定会走。”提利昂道，“而劳勃一定会命令他南下，反正史塔克大人对他儿子根本爱莫能助。”

</p></origin><translate id="div_803" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他可以帮他早日解脱，”詹姆道，“如果是我儿子，我就会这么干，这才是为他好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_804');"><p>"I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother," Tyrion said. "He would not take it kindly."
</p></origin><translate id="div_804" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“亲爱的哥哥呀，我可不建议你把这话拿去对史塔克大人讲。”提利昂道，“他可不会了解你的好心肠哟。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_805');"><p>"Even if the boy does live, he will be a cripple. Worse than a cripple. A grotesque. Give me a good clean death."
</p></origin><translate id="div_805" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“就算那孩子活下来，也成了跛子。恐怕连跛子都不如，根本就是个畸形的怪胎。我宁可干脆利落地死。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_806');"><p>Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders. "Speaking for the grotesques," he said, "I beg to differ. Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities."
</p></origin><translate id="div_806" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂用耸肩来回应这番话，只是这个动作更突显出他的驼背。“畸形怪胎，”他说，“不是我多嘴，但死了就什么都没了，活着起码还能充满希望。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_807');"><p>Jaime smiled. "You are a perverse little imp, aren’t you?"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_808');"><p>"Oh, yes," Tyrion admitted. "I hope the boy does wake. I would be most interested to hear what he might have to say."
</p></origin><translate id="div_808" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“呵，那当然，”提利昂承认，“我真心希望那孩子活过来，不为别的，我想听听他还知道些什么。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_809');"><p>His brother’s smile curdled like sour milk. "Tyrion, my sweet brother," he said darkly, "there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on."
</p></origin><translate id="div_809" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>哥哥的笑容像酸败的牛奶般突然僵祝“提利昂，我亲爱的好弟弟，”他阴阴地说，“有时候我还真不知道你站在哪一边。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_810');"><p>Tyrion’s mouth was full of bread and fish. He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down, and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime, "Why, Jaime, my sweet brother," he said, "you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
</p></origin><translate id="div_810" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂满嘴都是面包和煎鱼，他灌了一大口黑啤酒把食物冲下肚，露出狼一般的笑容对詹姆笑笑：“唉，我最亲爱的詹姆哥哥呀，”他说，“你这话好伤我的心，你难道不知我最爱家人了吗？”
