</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2789');"><p>As he stood in the predawn chill watching Chiggen butcher his horse, Tyrion Lannister chalked up one more debt owed the Starks. Steam rose from inside the carcass when the squat sellsword opened the belly with his skinning knife. His hands moved deftly, with never a wasted cut; the work had to be done quickly, before the stink of blood brought shadowcats down from the heights.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2789" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂•兰尼斯特站在天光未现的清冷晓色里，看着契根宰杀他的坐骑，暗暗在心里把史塔克家欠他的债再添上一笔。那佣兵用剥皮的刀割开马肚，蒸汽立刻从尸骸里冒出。他两手并用，熟练操作，一刀也不浪费。这事本当迅速完成，以免山上的影子山猫嗅到血腥闻香而来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2790');"><p>"None of us will go hungry tonight," Bronn said. He was near a shadow himself; bone thin and bone hard, with black eyes and black hair and a stubble of beard.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2790" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“今晚咱们都不会挨饿了。”波隆道。他瘦得像骨头一样，也坚毅得像骨头，黑眼黑发，加上短短的胡子，活像是团黑影。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2791');"><p>"Some of us may," Tyrion told him. "I am not fond of eating horse. Particularly my horse."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2791" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不见得。”提利昂告诉他。“我可对马肉没兴趣，尤其没兴趣吃自己的马。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2792');"><p>"Meat is meat," Bronn said with a shrug. "The Dothraki like horse more than beef or pork."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2792" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“反正都是肉，”波隆耸肩道，“跟牛肉和猪肉相比，多斯拉克人还更爱马肉呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2793');"><p>"Do you take me for a Dothraki?" Tyrion asked sourly. The Dothraki ate horse, in truth; they also left deformed children out for the feral dogs who ran behind their khalasars. Dothraki customs had scant appeal for him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2793" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你觉得我像多斯拉克人吗？”提利昂冷冷地说。多斯拉克人吃马肉是千真万确的事，他们还放任畸形儿自生自灭，留给跟在卡拉萨后面的野狗吃。他们的习俗委实不怎么吸引他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2794');"><p>Chiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held it up for inspection. "Want a taste, dwarf?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2794" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>契根从马尸上割下一薄片血淋淋的肉，举在半空中仔细瞧看。“矮个子，要不要先来一口？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2795');"><p>"My brother Jaime gave me that mare for my twenty-third name day," Tyrion said in a flat voice.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2795" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这匹母马是我老哥詹姆送给我的二十三岁命名日礼物。”提利昂用平板的口气说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2796');"><p>"Thank him for us, then. If you ever see him again." Chiggen grinned, showing yellow teeth, and swallowed the raw meat in two bites. "Tastes well bred."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2796" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那如果你还能活着见到他，代我们道声谢。”契根嘻嘻一笑，露出满嘴黄牙，然后两口就把那块生肉吞下肚去。“这马挺不错。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2797');"><p>"Better if you fry it up with onions," Bronn put in.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2797" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“配洋葱煎着吃更棒。”波隆建议。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2798');"><p>Wordlessly, Tyrion limped away. The cold had settled deep in his bones, and his legs were so sore he could scarcely walk. Perhaps his dead mare was the lucky one. He had hours more riding ahead of him, followed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short, cold sleep on hard ground, and then another night of the same, and another, and another, and the gods only knew how it would end. "Damn her," he muttered as he struggled up the road to rejoin his captors, remembering, "damn her and all the Starks."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2798" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂一言不发，跛着脚走开。他只觉寒意彻骨，两腿酸痛得几乎无法走动。或许他的母马死了反而幸运，因为他自己还有得走咧。每天晚上吃点东西，在坚硬又寒冷的岩地上小睡片刻，便又上路，如此日复一日，只有天上诸神知道何时才是尽头。“去她的，”他喃喃道，一边挣扎着上坡回到绑架他的人身边，一边忆起发生过的事。“姓史塔克的都该死。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2799');"><p>The memory was still bitter. One moment he’d been ordering supper, and an eye blink later he was facing a room of armed men, with Jyck reaching for a sword and the fat innkeep shrieking, "No swords, not here, please, m’lords."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2799" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>之前的经过，现在回想起来，依然很不好受。前一秒他才刚点晚餐，一眨眼全屋子的人却都拔刀相向，杰克也准备抽出武器，肥胖的老板娘则尖叫道：“各位大人，求求你们别在这儿动刀动枪。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2800');"><p>Tyrion wrenched down Jyck’s arm hurriedly, before he got them both hacked to pieces. "Where are your courtesies, Jyck? Our good hostess said no swords. Do as she asks." He forced a smile that must have looked as queasy as it felt. "You’re making a sad mistake, Lady Stark. I had no part in any attack on your son. On my honor..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2800" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂赶在他们两个一起被剁成肉块前抓住杰克的胳膊。“杰克，你的礼貌哪儿去了？咱们好心的老板娘不是说别动刀动枪吗？还不快照办。”他勉强挤出一丝微笑，心想在别人眼里一定难看。“史塔克夫人，我想您一定是弄错了，我跟贵公子的事一点关系也没有。我以我的荣誉起誓——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2801');"><p>"Lannister honor," was all she said. She held up her hands for all the room to see. "His dagger left these scars. The blade he sent to open my son’s throat."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2801" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“兰尼斯特的荣誉。”她只说了这句，便举起手让全屋子的人看。“这伤疤是他的匕首留下的。他派人用那把刀来割我儿子的喉咙。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2802');"><p>Tyrion felt the anger all around him, thick and smoky, fed by the deep cuts in the Stark woman’s hands. "Kill him," hissed some drunken slattern from the back, and other voices took up the call, faster than he would have believed. Strangers all, friendly enough only a moment ago, and yet now they cried for his blood like hounds on a trail.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2802" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂只感觉周遭人众的怒火上升，被那史塔克女人手上的伤煽动得简直要冒烟。“宰了他。”身后一个喝醉的妓女说，接着其他人也同声附和，速度快得使他不敢相信。大家素昧平生，刚才还颇为友善，如今竟像紧咬不放的嗜血猎犬般要他偿命。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2803');"><p>Tyrion spoke up loudly, trying to keep the quaver from his voice. "If Lady Stark believes I have some crime to answer for, I will go with her and answer for it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2803" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂提高音量，一边努力掩饰声音里的颤抖：“假如史塔克夫人认定我要为某些罪行负责，那我很乐意跟她去好好解释。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2804');"><p>It was the only possible course. Trying to cut their way out of this was a sure invitation to an early grave. A good dozen swords had responded to the Stark woman’s plea for help: the Harrenhal man, the three Brackens, a pair of unsavory sellswords who looked as though they’d kill him as soon as spit, and some fool field hands who doubtless had no idea what they were doing. Against that, what did Tyrion have? A dagger at his belt, and two men. Jyck swung a fair enough sword, but Morrec scarcely counted; he was part groom, part cook, part body servant, and no soldier. As for Yoren, whatever his feelings might have been, the black brothers were sworn to take no part in the quarrels of the realm. Yoren would do nothing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2804" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这是惟一的办法。试图杀出重围无异自掘坟墓。有十来个人应那史塔克女人的请求拔了剑：那名赫伦堡的武士，三个布雷肯家的人，还有两个一副吐口痰就可以把他干掉模样的讨厌佣兵，以及一群根本不知道自己在做什么的庄稼汉。提利昂拿什么对付这些人？杰克的剑使得还不赖，但莫里斯就完全不行，他身兼马夫、厨子和照顾起居的随从三职，原本就不是打仗的料。至于尤伦，无论他自己想法为何，黑衣弟兄可是发过誓，与王国内任何争执都无舒。尤伦只会袖手旁观。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2805');"><p>And indeed, the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by Catelyn Stark’s side said, "Take their weapons," and the sellsword Bronn stepped forward to pull the sword from Jyck’s fingers and relieve them all of their daggers. "Good," the old man said as the tension in the common room ebbed palpably, "excellent." Tyrion recognized the gruff voice; Winterfell’s master-at-arms, shorn of his whiskers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2805" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>果不其然，当凯特琳•史塔克身边的老骑士喝道“没收他们的武器”时，黑衣弟兄便静静地站到一边。佣兵波隆走上前来，从杰克手中拿下剑，并且搜出他们所有的匕首。“很好。”老人说。房间里的紧张气氛明显缓和下来。“干得不错。”提利昂认出那粗硬的声音，是临冬城的教头，只是剃了胡子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2806');"><p>Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep’s mouth as she begged of Catelyn Stark, "Don’t kill him here!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2806" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>胖老板娘向凯特琳•史塔克苦苦哀求，嘴里喷出一串腥红的唾沫：“别在这儿杀他！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2807');"><p>"Don’t kill him anywhere," Tyrion urged.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2807" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“到哪儿都别杀他。”提利昂提议。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2808');"><p>"Take him somewheres else, no blood here, m’lady, I wants no high lordlin’s quarrels."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2808" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，要杀也请您到别的地方杀，别把我这儿弄得到处是血，我不想惹上官家的麻烦事儿啊。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2809');"><p>"We are taking him back to Winterfell," she said, and Tyrion thought, Well, perhaps?.?.?.?By then he’d had a moment to glance over the room and get a better idea of the situation. He was not altogether displeased by what he saw. Oh, the Stark woman had been clever, no doubt of it. Force them to make a public affirmation of the oaths sworn her father by the lords they served, and then call on them for succor, and her a woman, yes, that was sweet. Yet her success was not as complete as she might have liked. There were close to fifty in the common room by his rough count. Catelyn Stark’s plea had roused a bare dozen; the others looked confused, or frightened, or sullen. Only two of the Freys had stirred, Tyrion noted, and they’d sat back down quick enough when their captain failed to move. He might have smiled if he’d dared.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2809" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们要把他带回临冬城去。”她说，提利昂听了心想：要是这样的话，或许……当时他已趁短暂余暇环顾四周，对当下情形更有掌握。眼前所见不至于让他绝望。噢，那史塔克女人反应倒是机敏，这无庸置疑。她先逼他们公开承认自家主子对她父亲的誓约，然后再请他们拔刀相助，何况她又是区区一个弱女子。没错，这招厉害。然而她也没有赢得太彻底。据他约略估算，饭厅里将近有五十个人。凯特琳•史塔克不过说动了十来个，其他人有的困惑，有的害怕，还有的冷漠。提利昂注意到，佛雷家那群人只有两个准备响应，而他们眼看带头的没动静，便又很快坐回去了。若不是不敢，否则他还真想偷笑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2810');"><p>"Winterfell it is, then," he said instead. That was a long ride, as he could well attest, having just ridden it the other way. So many things could happen along the way. "My father will wonder what has become of me," he added, catching the eye of the swordsman who’d offered to yield up his room. "He’ll pay a handsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today." Lord Tywin would do no such thing, of course, but Tyrion would make up for it if he won free.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2810" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“临冬城，去就去。”他说。这会是趟漫长的旅途，他自己刚从反方向走来，有着切身的体会。谁也说不准途中会有什么变数。“不过我不告而别，我老爸可能会担心我，”他补充道，一边看着刚才那个自愿把房间让给他的流浪剑客。“谁把今天发生的事告诉他，他定将重重赏赐。”泰温公爵当然不会如此，提利昂打算等自己脱身后再想办法补偿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2811');"><p>Ser Rodrik glanced at his lady, his look worried, as well it might be. "His men come with him," the old knight announced. "And we’ll thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what you’ve seen here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2811" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗德利克爵士忧心忡忡地看看他的女主人，这老家伙也没什么高招。“他的人跟他一起走。”老骑士宣布，“刚才发生的事，还请诸位不要张扬。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2812');"><p>It was all Tyrion could do not to laugh. Quiet? The old fool. Unless he took the whole inn, the word would begin to spread the instant they were gone. The freerider with the gold coin in his pocket would fly to Casterly Rock like an arrow. If not him, then someone else. Yoren would carry the story south. That fool singer might make a lay of it. The Freys would report back to their lord, and the gods only knew what he might do. Lord Walder Frey might be sworn to Riverrun, but he was a cautious man who had lived a long time by making certain he was always on the winning side. At the very least he would send his birds winging south to King’s Landing, and he might well dare more than that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2812" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂好容易才忍住笑。不要张扬？老糊涂蛋。除非把整间旅店里的人都抓起来，否则前脚刚踏出门，后脚消息就会散播开去。那个口袋里装了金币的流浪武士一定会心急火燎地飞速赶往凯岩城通风报信，就算他没去，别人也一定会去。尤伦将把消息带往南方，而那个愚蠢的歌手说不定还会为此写首歌谣。佛雷家的手下会回报他们主子，他下一步会怎么做，只有天上诸神知道。瓦德•佛雷男爵虽然是奔流城的臣属，但他活了这么大把年纪，靠的就是小心谨慎，永远站在赢家那边。至少他会派鸟儿送信息到君临，很可能还不只这样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2813');"><p>Catelyn Stark wasted no time. "We must ride at once. We’ll want fresh mounts, and provisions for the road. You men, know that you have the eternal gratitude of House Stark. If any of you choose to help us guard our captives and get them safe to Winterfell, I promise you shall be well rewarded." That was all it took; the fools came rushing forward. Tyrion studied their faces; they would indeed be well rewarded, he vowed to himself, but perhaps not quite as they imagined.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2813" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳•史塔克一点时间也没浪费。“我们马上动身，我们需要精力充足的马，还有路上必须的粮食。你们几位，史塔克家族永远感激你们。假如你们愿意协助我们押送犯人前往临冬城，我保证有重赏。”那些个蠢蛋就等这句话，听了立刻一拥而上。提利昂一个接一个地审视他们的脸庞：你们的确会得到重赏，他发誓，只怕不是你们想像的那种。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2814');"><p>Yet even as they were bundling him outside, saddling the horses in the rain, and tying his hands with a length of coarse rope, Tyrion Lannister was not truly afraid. They would never get him to Winterfell, he would have given odds on that. Riders would be after them within the day, birds would take wing, and surely one of the river lords would want to curry favor with his father enough to take a hand. Tyrion was congratulating himself on his subtlety when someone pulled a hood down over his eyes and lifted him up onto a saddle.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2814" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们立刻来到屋外，冒着雨给马备鞍。他们用粗绳绑住提利昂的手，他却不怎么害怕。他敢打赌，他们绝对无法把他押回临冬城，不出一天，定会有人骑马追来，这有什么好奇怪呢？鸟儿会送出讯息，届时必有河间地区的领主插手，借机讨好他老爸。提利昂正对自己的精打细算感到得意，就被人盖上兜帽，遮住眼睛，放上马鞍。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2815');"><p>They set out through the rain at a hard gallop, and before long Tyrion’s thighs were cramped and aching and his butt throbbed with pain. Even when they were safely away from the inn, and Catelyn Stark slowed them to a trot, it was a miserable pounding journey over rough ground, made worse by his blindness. Every twist and turn put him in danger of falling off his horse. The hood muffled sound, so he could not make out what was being said around him, and the rain soaked through the cloth and made it cling to his face, until even breathing was a struggle. The rope chafed his wrists raw and seemed to grow tighter as the night wore on. I was about to settle down to a warm fire and a roast fowl, and that wretched singer had to open his mouth, he thought mournfully. The wretched singer had come along with them. "There is a great song to be made from this, and I’m the one to make it," he told Catelyn Stark when he announced his intention of riding with them to see how the "splendid adventure" turned out. Tyrion wondered whether the boy would think the adventure quite so splendid once the Lannister riders caught up with them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2815" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们快马加鞭地冒雨出发，没过多久提利昂便已两腿酸疼，屁股也磨得难受。虽然安然远离旅店之后，凯特琳•史塔克便放慢速度，但这仍旧是一趟崎岖难行的艰苦旅程，蒙住眼睛更是雪上加霜。每次转弯他都有坠马的危险。透过头套听见的声音很模糊，所以他不清楚身边的人在说什么。细雨浸湿布料，头套紧贴脸庞，后来连呼吸都有困难。粗绳磨破他的手腕，随着夜色渐深，似乎越来越紧。他本来是要好好坐下，在火炉边取暖，享用刚烤出来的鸟肉的，只怪那该死的歌手偏偏要张开他的乌鸦嘴，他可怜兮兮地想。这该死的歌手竟然也在队伍里。“这件事值得大加传颂，我当然义不容辞啰。”当他宣布和他们一道，好瞧瞧这趟“精彩的冒险”会有什么结果时，他对凯特琳•史塔克这么说。提利昂不禁心想：等兰尼斯特家的骑士追上他们，你小子再来瞧瞧这趟冒险精不精彩。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2816');"><p>The rain had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth over his eyes when Catelyn Stark gave the command to dismount. Rough hands pulled him down from his horse, untied his wrists, and yanked the hood off his head. When he saw the narrow stony road, the foothills rising high and wild all around them, and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon, all the hope went out of him in a rush. "This is the high road," he gasped, looking at Lady Stark with accusation. "The eastern road. You said we were riding for Winterfell!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2816" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳•史塔克下令暂时休息时，雨总算停了，曙光从湿布间的缝隙渗进眼帘。他被人粗手粗脚地拉下马，解开腕上的粗绳，拉掉头罩。当他看见眼前狭窄的石头路，四周愈见陡峭险恶的丘陵地势，以及远方地平线上呈锯齿状的覆雪峰峦，心中一切希望顿时化为乌有。“这是上坡路，”他用控诉的神情看着史塔克夫人，失声道，“是朝东边的路。你说我们要去临冬城！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2817');"><p>Catelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles. "Often and loudly," she agreed. "No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us. I wish them good speed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2817" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳•史塔克带着轻浅的笑意看着他。“说了很多次，而且很大声。”她同意，“想必你的朋友们会打那边追赶我们。祝他们一路顺风。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2818');"><p>Even now, long days later, the memory filled him with a bitter rage. All his life Tyrion had prided himself on his cunning, the only gift the gods had seen fit to give him, and yet this seven-times-damned she-wolf Catelyn Stark had outwitted him at every turn. The knowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his abduction.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2818" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>即使过了这么些天，现在回想起来，他还是恼怒不已。提利昂这辈子向来以机敏自豪，因为那是天上诸神赐给他的惟一礼物，没想到这该死七次的母狼凯特琳•史塔克却魔高一丈，想到自己每一着棋都被她识破，简直比他被绑架这件事还叫他难过。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2819');"><p>They stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses, and then they were off again. This time Tyrion was spared the hood. After the second night they no longer bound his hands, and once they had gained the heights they scarcely bothered to guard him at all. It seemed they did not fear his escape. And why should they? Up here the land was harsh and wild, and the high road little more than a stony track. If he did run, how far could he hope to go, alone and without provisions? The shadowcats would make a morsel of him, and the clans that dwelt in the mountain fastnesses were brigands and murderers who bowed to no law but the sword.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2819" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们只停下来让马儿吃草喝水，便又匆匆上路。这次他们放过了提利昂，没再给他戴上头套，两天后更松开绑住他双手的绳子，等进入高山区，更是连派人看守都免了。他们似乎不怕他逃走，有什么好怕的？这里地势崎岖险恶，所谓的大道不过是条石头小径。就算他真的脱逃成功，在没有粮食又只身一人的情况下，能跑多远？影子山猫会拿他当点心，而蛰居山间的氏族部落更是些杀人越货的法外凶徒，惟有刀剑能叫他们臣服。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2820');"><p>Yet still the Stark woman drove them forward relentlessly. He knew where they were bound. He had known it since the moment they pulled off his hood. These mountains were the domain of House Arryn, and the late Hand’s widow was a Tully, Catelyn Stark’s sister?.?.?.?and no friend to the Lannisters. Tyrion had known the Lady Lysa slightly during her years at King’s Landing, and did not look forward to renewing the acquaintance.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2820" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>虽然如此，史塔克家的女人还是无情地催促他们赶路。此行目的地为何，早在头套被摘下那一刻，他便一清二楚。此间山区是艾林家族的领地，而前任首相的遗孀也是徒利家人，正是凯特琳•史塔克的妹妹……换言之，对兰尼斯特家无甚好感。在莱莎夫人待在君临的那些年里，提利昂跟她算是点头之交，此时此刻实在不想再续前缘。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2821');"><p>His captors were clustered around a stream a short ways down the high road. The horses had drunk their fill of the icy cold water, and were grazing on clumps of brown grass that grew from clefts in the rock. Jyck and Morrec huddled close, sullen and miserable. Mohor stood over them, leaning on his spear and wearing a rounded iron cap that made him look as if he had a bowl on his head. Nearby, Marillion the singer sat oiling his woodharp, complaining of what the damp was doing to his strings.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2821" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>绑架他的人们聚集在离山坡不远的小溪边。马儿们喝饱了冰冷的山泉，正啃食着从岩缝里长出的褐色杂草。杰克和莫里斯可怜兮兮地窝在一起，摩霍尔拄着长枪站在他们旁边，头戴一顶圆形铁盔，活像扣了个大碗。马瑞里安坐在他身边，正帮木头竖琴上油，一边抱怨湿气对琴弦有害。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2822');"><p>"We must have some rest, my lady," the hedge knight Ser Willis Wode was saying to Catelyn Stark as Tyrion approached. He was Lady Whent’s man, stiff-necked and stolid, and the first to rise to aid Catelyn Stark back at the inn.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2822" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，我们真的需要休息。”提利昂走近时，雇佣骑士维里•渥德正对凯特琳•史塔克说话。他是河安伯爵夫人的手下，看来一副硬汉模样，麻木无情，却是旅店里头一个响应凯特琳•史塔克的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2823');"><p>"Ser Willis speaks truly, my lady," Ser Rodrik said. "This is the third horse we have lost..."

He was one of the Brackens, a man-at-arms in the service of Lord Jonos. Tyrion had made a special effort to learn all their names, so he might thank them later for their tender treatment of him. A Lannister always paid his debts. Kurleket would learn that someday, as would his friends Lharys and Mohor, and the good Ser Willis, and the sellswords Bronn and Chiggen. He planned an especially sharp lesson for Marillion, him of the woodharp and the sweet tenor voice, who was struggling so manfully to rhyme imp with gimp and limp so he could make a song of this outrage.

He managed to wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out of the way. Marillion was less fortunate. Horse and rider crashed to the ground in a tangle on top of the singer.

The dawn was full of shouts and screams and heavy with the scent of blood, and the world had turned to chaos. Arrows hissed past his ear and clattered off the rocks. He saw Bronn unhorsed, fighting with a sword in each hand. Tyrion kept on the fringes of the fight, sliding from rock to rock and darting out of the shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses. He found a wounded clansman and left him dead, helping himself to the man’s halfhelm. It fit too snugly, but Tyrion was glad of any protection at all. Jyck was cut down from behind while he sliced at a man in front of him, and later Tyrion stumbled over Kurleket’s body. The pig face had been smashed in with a mace, but Tyrion recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the man’s dead fingers. He was sliding it through his belt when he heard a woman’s scream.

She had a dagger clutched awkwardly in her maimed hands, but her back was to the rock now and they had penned her on three sides. Let them have the bitch, Tyrion thought, and welcome to her, yet somehow he was moving. He caught the first man in the back of the knee before they even knew he was there, and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood. Logs that bleed, Tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for him. Tyrion ducked under his sword, lashed out with the axe, the man reeled backward?.?.?.?and Catelyn Stark stepped up behind him and opened his throat. The horseman remembered an urgent engagement elsewhere and galloped off suddenly.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2877');"><p>Tyrion looked around. The enemy were all vanquished or vanished. Somehow the fighting had ended when he wasn’t looking. Dying horses and wounded men lay all around, screaming or moaning. To his vast astonishment, he was not one of them. He opened his fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground. His hands were sticky with blood. He could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day, but the sun seemed scarcely to have moved at all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2877" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂环顾四周，敌人不是被杀便是逃走，总之战斗在他没注意到的时候已经结束。辫地都是濒死的马和负伤的人，发出惨叫和呻吟。最令他惊讶的是自己竟安然无恙。他松开手指，斧头锵一声落在地上，忽然发现自己满手是血。他相信他们起码打了半天之久，但太阳却纹丝未动。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2878');"><p>"Your first battle?" Bronn asked later as he bent over Jyck’s body, pulling off his boots. They were good boots, as befit one of Lord Tywin’s men; heavy leather, oiled and supple, much finer than what Bronn was wearing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2878" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“第一次上战场？”过了一会儿，波隆站在杰克的尸体上一边弯身脱靴子，一边问。那是双好靴子，厚实的皮革，上过油，柔软异常，正配泰温公爵手下的身份，比起波隆穿的要好太多了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2879');"><p>Tyrion nodded. "My father will be so proud," he said. His legs were cramping so badly he could scarcely stand. Odd, he had never once noticed the pain during the battle.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2879" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂点点头。“我老爸应该会骄傲。”他说。他的脚抽筋得厉害，几乎无法站立。奇怪，刚才打斗时却一点不觉得疼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2880');"><p>"You need a woman now," Bronn said with a glint in his black eyes. He shoved the boots into his saddlebag. "Nothing like a woman after a man’s been blooded, take my word."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2880" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你需要找个女人，”波隆眨着黑眼睛，顺手将靴子扔进自己的马鞍袋。“相信我，流过血之后，找个女人最来劲。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2882');"><p>Tyrion glanced over to where Lady Stark was dressing Ser Rodrik’s wounds. "I’m willing if she is," he said. The freeriders broke into laughter, and Tyrion grinned and thought, There’s a start.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2882" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂瞄了一眼正帮罗德利克爵士包扎的史塔克夫人。“她说好我就上。”他说。两个流浪武士听了哈哈大笑，提利昂一边跟着乐一边想：这是个好的开始。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2883');"><p>Afterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off his face in water cold as ice. As he limped back to the others, he glanced again at the slain. The dead clansmen were thin, ragged men, their horses scrawny and undersized, with every rib showing. What weapons Bronn and Chiggen had left them were none too impressive. Mauls, clubs, a scythe?.?.?.?He remembered the big man in the shadowskin cloak who had dueled Ser Rodrik with a two-handed greatsword, but when he found his corpse sprawled on the stony ground, the man was not so big after all, the cloak was gone, and Tyrion saw that the blade was badly notched, its cheap steel spotted with rust. Small wonder the clansmen had left nine bodies on the ground.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2883" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>随后他跪在溪边，用冰冷刺骨的溪水洗去脸上血迹。他瘸着腿走回去时，又看了看地上的死人。战死的原住民都是些衣衫褴褛、瘦骨嶙峋的家伙，他们的坐骑也是又瘦又小，根根肋骨清楚可见。波隆和契根挑剩下的武器都不怎么起眼，大锤、棍棒，还有一把镰刀……他想起那个穿了影子山猫皮披风、拿双手巨剑和罗德利克爵士对打的大汉，但当他看到那人四肢伸展躺在石地上的尸首时，他看起来一点也不高大。他的披风没了踪影，提利昂发现他的剑锋早就布满缺口，廉价钢铁锈得厉害。难怪原住民倒下九个。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2884');"><p>They had only three dead; two of Lord Bracken’s men-at-arms, Kurleket and Mohor, and his own man Jyck, who had made such a bold show with his bareback charge. A fool to the end, Tyrion thought.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2884" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们这边只死了三人：两个布雷肯伯爵的手下——库雷凯特和摩霍尔，还有他自己的护卫杰克，他奋不顾身的冲锋充分显示了他的愚勇。到死都还是傻子一个，提利昂心想。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2885');"><p>"Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste," Ser Willis Wode said, his eyes scanning the ridgetops warily through the slit in his helm. "We drove them off for the moment, but they will not have gone far."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2885" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“史塔克夫人，我请求您立刻动身，加紧赶路。”维里•渥德爵士道，他透过头盔上那道细缝，小心翼翼地扫视着附近山脊。“我们虽然暂时赶跑了他们，但他们不会走远。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2886');"><p>"We must bury our dead, Ser Willis," she said. "These were brave men. I will not leave them to the crows and shadowcats."

</p></origin><translate id="div_2889" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“要怎么搬随你便，”波隆告诉她，“但我和契根可不干。比起在死人身上堆石头，我还有更要紧的事情……比如呼吸。”他环视其余的生还者。“你们要是还想活过今晚，就跟我们走。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2890');"><p>"My lady, I fear he speaks the truth," Ser Rodrik said wearily. The old knight had been wounded in the fight, a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that grazed his neck, and he sounded his age. "If we linger here, they will be on us again for a certainty, and we may not live through a second attack."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2890" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，恐怕他说的没错。”罗德利克爵士虚弱地说。老骑士在打斗中负了伤，左臂被深深割了一道，脖子也被掷出的辬枪擦伤，如今老态尽露。“若是在此逗留，他们一定会再次攻击，到时候我们可能就顶不住了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2891');"><p>Tyrion could see the anger in Catelyn’s face, but she had no choice. "May the gods forgive us, then. We will ride at once."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2892');"><p>There was no shortage of horses now. Tyrion moved his saddle to Jyck’s spotted gelding, who looked strong enough to last another three or four days at least. He was about to mount when Lharys stepped up and said, "I’ll take that dirk now, dwarf."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2892" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>现在马倒是不缺。提利昂把他的马鞍移到杰克的花斑公马背上，因为它看起来还算强壮，再撑个三四天应该没问题。他正准备上马，只见拉利斯往前一站道：“侏儒，把你的匕首交给我。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2893');"><p>"Let him keep it." Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse. "And see that he has his axe back as well. We may have need of it if we are attacked again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2893" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“让他留着吧。”凯特琳•史塔克从马上往下俯看，“斧头也还给他，若是再遇攻击，可能还用得着。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2895');"><p>"Save them," she said curtly. "I trust you no more than I did before." She was gone before he could frame a reply.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2895" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“省省吧，”她唐突地说，“我跟以前一样不信任你。”他还来不及回嘴，她便拍马离开。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2896');"><p>Tyrion adjusted his stolen helm and took the axe from Bronn. He remembered how he had begun the journey, with his wrists bound and a hood pulled down over his head, and decided that this was a definite improvement. Lady Stark could keep her trust; so long as he could keep the axe, he would count himself ahead in the game.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2896" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂整了整偷来的头盔，然后从波隆手中接过斧头。他想起这趟旅程刚开始时，自己两手被绑，戴着头罩，如今堪称大有进展。史塔克夫人不信任他没关系，只要他能留住斧头，他就有信心在这场游戏里胜过对手。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2897');"><p>Ser Willis Wode led them out. Bronn took the rear, with Lady Stark safely in the middle, Ser Rodrik a shadow beside her. Marillion kept throwing sullen looks back at Tyrion as they rode. The singer had broken several ribs, his woodharp, and all four fingers on his playing hand, yet the day had not been an utter loss to him; somewhere he had acquired a magnificent shadowskin cloak, thick black fur slashed by stripes of white. He huddled beneath its folds silently, and for once had nothing to say.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2897" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>维里•渥德领队，波隆负责殿后，史塔克夫人安全地骑在队伍中间，罗德利克爵士则如影随形跟在她身旁。途中，马瑞里安带着怨恨的眼光，不断回头看他，他的几根肋骨，木头竖琴，还有用来弹奏的四根指头通通断了，但他还不算倒霉到极点：他弄来一件漂亮的影子山猫皮披风，厚实的黑毛皮，点缀着白线。他沉默地缩在斗篷里，难得地闭上了嘴巴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2898');"><p>They heard the deep growls of shadowcats behind them before they had gone half a mile, and later the wild snarling of the beasts fighting over the corpses they had left behind. Marillion grew visibly pale. Tyrion trotted up beside him. "Craven," he said, "rhymes nicely with raven." He kicked his horse and moved past the singer, up to Ser Rodrik and Catelyn Stark.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2898" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>行不到半里，他们便听见背后影子山猫低沉的吼叫，稍后又传来它们争食尸体的咆哮。马瑞里安的脸色愈加苍白，提利昂骑马跑到他旁边。“‘黑鸟’，”他道，“恰好跟 ‘胆子小’押韵。”说完他一踢马肚，丢下吟游诗人，跑到罗德利克爵士和凯特琳•史塔克身边。

</p></origin><translate id="div_2900" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“刚才我话说到一半，就被人无礼地打断了。”提利昂开口道，“小指头编的故事里有个很严重的疏漏。史塔克夫人，无论你信不信，我可以向你保证——我跟别人赌的时候，只把注下在自家人身上。”
