</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2207');"><p>Lord Arryn’s death was a great sadness for all of us, my lord," Grand Maester Pycelle said. "I would be more than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing. Do be seated. Would you care for refreshments? Some dates, perhaps? I have some very fine persimmons as well. Wine no longer agrees with my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened with honey. I find it most refreshing in this heat."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2207" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，艾林公爵的死对我们是个沉重的打击。”派席尔国师说，“我自然很乐意告诉您他过世的情形。请坐。您要不要吃些点心？来几颗枣子如何？我这儿还有些上好的柿子。我这把年纪虽然不能喝酒，倒是可以帮您弄杯冰牛奶，加过蜂蜜的。大热天里喝这个正合适。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2208');"><p>There was no denying the heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest. Thick, moist air covered the city like a damp woolen blanket, and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot, airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water, where the only breath of wind was to be found. "That would be most kind," Ned said, seating himself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2208" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>天气的确很热，奈德的丝臼外衣贴紧前胸。空气郁窒而潮湿，像条湿羊毛毯般覆盖整个城市。穷人纷纷逃离他们闷热窒息的住所，想在河畔抢个位子歇息，只有那里才有些许微风，结果河边被挤得壅塞不堪。“那就谢谢您了。”奈德说着坐了下来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2209');"><p>Pycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently. A slender young serving girl hurried into the solar. "Iced milk for the King’s Hand and myself, if you would be so kind, child. Well sweetened."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2209" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔用拇指和食指拣起一个精巧的小银铃，轻轻摇了两下。一名清瘦的女侍急忙赶进来。 “我的好孩子，请你帮首相大人和我各弄一杯冰牛奶，多加点蜂蜜。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2210');"><p>As the girl went to fetch their drinks, the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach. "The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest. It is not so, yet ofttimes it feels that way, does it not? On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows." The heavy jeweled chain around the old man’s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat. "To be sure, King Maekar’s summer was hotter than this one, and near as long. There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke suddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter. Still, the heat was fierce while it lasted. Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night. We would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods. I remember the smells of those nights, my lord, perfume and sweat, melons ripe to bursting, peaches and pomegranates, nightshade and moonbloom. I was a young man then, still forging my chain. The heat did not exhaust me as it does now." Pycelle’s eyes were so heavily lidded he looked half-asleep. "My pardons, Lord Eddard. You did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your father was born. Forgive an old man his wanderings, if you would. Minds are like swords, I do fear. The old ones go to rust. Ah, and here is our milk." The serving girl placed the tray between them, and Pycelle gave her a smile. "Sweet child." He lifted a cup, tasted, nodded. "Thank you. You may go."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2211');"><p>When the girl had taken her leave, Pycelle peered at Ned through pale, rheumy eyes. "Now where were we? Oh, yes. You asked about Lord Arryn?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2211" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>女孩离开后，派席尔用他那双苍白而湿润的眼睛打量奈德，“我们说到哪儿了？噢，您问起艾林大人……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2212');"><p>"I did." Ned sipped politely at the iced milk. It was pleasantly cold, but oversweet to his taste.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2212" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的。”奈德很有礼貌地啜着牛奶，冰凉凉的很爽口，只是对他而言太甜了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2213');"><p>"If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time," Pycelle said. "We had sat together on council many a year, he and I, and the signs were there to read, but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long. Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm, and more besides. His son was ever sickly, and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight. It was enough to weary even a strong man, and the Lord Jon was not young. Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired. Or so I thought at the time. Yet now I am less certain." He gave a ponderous shake of his head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2213" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“说实话，前首相大人之前就常常心神不宁。”派席尔道，“我和他共事这么多年，还有什么征兆看不出来？我认为这是来源于他长久以来默默承受的重责大任。他那对宽阔的肩膀都快被国家大事和别的心事给压垮了。尤其是他儿子身体孱弱，夫人为此忧心忡忡，几乎不敢让他离开视线范围。这样的压力连身强体壮的人尚且难以负荷，何况琼恩大人他年纪也已不轻。若他为此身心俱疲，实在不足为奇。至少我当时是这样想的。现在我却不敢妄下断论。”他若有所思地摇摇头。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2214');"><p>"What can you tell me of his final illness?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2214" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他到底生了什么病？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2215');"><p>The Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow. "He came to me one day asking after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply. The next morning he was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed. Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach. The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which can upset the digestion. When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not grant me the power to save him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2215" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国师摊开手，做出无可奈何的悲伤姿势。“有天他来找我要一本书，身子骨和平时一样，硬朗得没话说，但我看得出他心头在挂虑什么。隔天早晨，他便周身疼痛，连床也起不来了。柯蒙学士认为他只是肠胃受了寒，这些日子天气热，首相大人常在葡萄酒里加冰块，很有可能影响消化。然而琼恩大人的病情却持续恶化，于是我亲自出马，只是诸神不肯赐予我拯救他的力量。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2216');"><p>"I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2216" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“听说您当时把柯蒙师傅给遣开了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2217');"><p>The Grand Maester’s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier. "I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best. Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2217" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大学士慢慢而郑重地点了点头，有如缓缓流动的冰河。“是啊，只怕莱莎夫人永远也不会原谅我。或许我做得不对，然而当时我觉得这是最好的选择。我把柯蒙师傅当自己儿子一般看待，对他的能力我也绝对有信心，然而他太年轻，年轻人往往无法体会老年人的身体有多虚弱。他让艾林大人喝下清肠剂和胡椒液，本意是想呕出毒素，怕只怕这反而会害了公爵。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2218');"><p>"Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2218" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“艾林大人病危时跟您说过些什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2219');"><p>Pycelle wrinkled his brow. "In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several times, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say. Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might be taken ill. The king did come, and he sat beside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon’s spirits. His love was fierce to see."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2219" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔皱起眉头，“在他最后高烧弥留的阶段，首相大人多次高呼’劳勃‘这个名字，我不确定他是叫他的爱子还是国王陛下。莱莎夫人不准孩子进病房，怕他被传染。国王陛下倒是来过，在病床边坐了好长时间，跟琼恩大人谈起往日的美好时光，希望能提振他的精神。他对前首相的敬爱非常明显。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2220');"><p>"Was there nothing else? No final words?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2220" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有别的吗？没有遗言？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2221');"><p>"When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so he should not suffer. Just before he closed his eyes for the last time, he whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a blessing for his son. The seed is strong, he said. At the end, his speech was too slurred to comprehend. Death did not come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that. He never spoke again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2221" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我眼看首相大人康复无望，便给他喝了罂粟花奶，好让他不再受苦。他在阖眼之前，向夫人和国王陛下说了句为爱子祈福的话。他说’种性强韧‘. 末了，他的吐词已经含糊不清，难辨其意。虽然隔天清晨人才故去，但琼恩大人在那之后已经平静下来，没再开口。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2222');"><p>Ned took another swallow of milk, trying not to gag on the sweetness of it. "Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn’s death?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2222" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德又喝了口牛奶，努力忍受腻人的甜味。“那，依您之见，琼恩•艾林大人的死有无蹓跷？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2223');"><p>"Unnatural?" The aged maester’s voice was thin as a whisper. "No, I could not say so. Sad, for a certainty. Yet in its own way, death is the most natural thing of all, Lord Eddard. Jon Arryn rests easy now, his burdens lifted at last."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2223" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有无蹓跷？”老师傅的声音轻得像是悄悄话，“不，我认为没有。艾德大人，死亡固然令人悲伤，但从另一方面讲，却也是最自然不过的事。琼恩•艾林大人如今已卸下所有重担，长眠于地底了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2224');"><p>"This illness that took him," said Ned. "Had you ever seen its like before, in other men?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2224" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夺走他性命的这种病，”艾德说，“您以前见过吗？在其他病人身上？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2225');"><p>"Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms," Pycelle replied. "Under our good King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him, and even for a few short months under Jaehaerys’s father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of His Name. I have seen more of illness than I care to remember, my lord. I will tell you this: Every case is different, and every case is alike. Lord Jon’s death was no stranger than any other."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2225" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我做七国的国师已近四十年，”派席尔回答，“服侍过我们的好国王劳勃，在他之前的伊里斯•坦格利安，伊里斯的父亲杰赫里斯二世，甚至还在杰赫里斯的父亲’幸运的‘伊耿五世手下做过几个月。首相大人，我见过的疾病不胜枚举，让我告诉您罢：每种疾病虽不一样，却都有共通之处。琼恩大人的死并不比其他人来得离奇。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2226');"><p>"His wife thought otherwise."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2226" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他的夫人可不这么认为。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2227');"><p>The Grand Maester nodded. "I recall now, the widow is sister to your own noble wife. If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech, let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was never that. Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in every shadow, and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2227" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国师点点头。“我想起来了，他的遗孀是尊夫人的妹妹。如果您不嫌我这老人家说话莽撞，容我这么说，即便最坚强、最自臸的人，往往也容易被悲伤所影响，何况莱莎夫人本不是那样的人。她自上次流产之后，便疑神疑鬼，处处以为有人要与她为敌，想必首相大人的死让她心都碎了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2228');"><p>"So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2228" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“所以你确信琼恩•艾林死于突发性疾病？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2229');"><p>"I am," Pycelle replied gravely. "If not illness, my good lord, what else could it be?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2229" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的。”派席尔沉重地回答，“若非疾病，我的好大人，还会是什么呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2230');"><p>"Poison," Ned suggested quietly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2230" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“毒药。”奈德静静地提示。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2231');"><p>Pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open. The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat. "A disturbing thought. We are not the Free Cities, where such things are common. Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt." He fell silent for a moment, his eyes lost in thought. "What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it likely. Every hedge maester knows the common poisons, and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs. And the Hand was loved by all. What sort of monster in man’s flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2231" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔的惺忪睡眼猛地睁大，这位老师傅不安地在座位上挪动身子。“这想法真叫人不寒而栗。我们并非身在自由贸易城邦，只有在那里，这种事才是家常便饭。虽说伊萨穆尔国师提醒我们每个人心里都有谋杀的种子，即便如此，下毒还是太令人不齿。”他沉默了一会儿，眼神若有所思。“大人，您所提出的这种可能性，我认为不存在。随便雇一个乡野学士都能看出常见的中毒症状，艾林大人却没有任何类似迹象。更何况人人都爱戴首相大人，怎么会有禽兽胆敢毒害如此高贵的好人呢？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2232');"><p>"I have heard it said that poison is a woman’s weapon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2232" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我倒听说毒药是女人的武器。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2233');"><p>Pycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully. "It is said. Women, cravens?.?.?.?and eunuchs." He cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes. Above them, a raven cawed loudly in the rookery. "The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys, did you know? Put not your trust in spiders, my lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2233" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔沉吟着捻胡须。“是有这种说法。包括女人、懦夫……还有太监。”他清清喉咙，朝草席吐口浓痰。在他们头顶上方，有只乌鸦在巢里大声怪叫。“您可知道，瓦里斯伯爵原本是里斯的奴隶？大人，千万不能信任蜘蛛啊。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2234');"><p>That was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told; there was something about Varys that made his flesh crawl. "I will remember that, Maester. And I thank you for your help. I have taken enough of your time." He stood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2234" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这话奈德不用他提醒，瓦里斯有种能让他浑身起鸡皮疙瘩的本事。“我会记住的，师傅。谢谢您的协助，只怕我已经占用您太多时间了。”他站起身。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2235');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted Ned to the door. "I hope I have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease. If there is any other service I might perform, you need only ask."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2235" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔国师缓缓推开椅子，送奈德到门边。“希望我这一点绵薄之力能让您安心。如果还有别的地方帮得上忙，您尽管开口。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2236');"><p>"One thing," Ned told him. "I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he fell ill."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2236" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还有一件事，”奈德对他说，“我对琼恩生病前天跟您借的那本书很好奇，不知可否拿来一阅？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2237');"><p>"I fear you would find it of little interest," Pycelle said. "It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2237" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“恐怕您会觉得很无趣，”派席尔道，“那是梅利恩国师所写的一本大部头，里面讲的全是各大家族的历代谱系。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2238');"><p>"Still, I should like to see it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2238" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没关系，我只想看看。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2239');"><p>The old man opened the door. "As you wish. I have it here somewhere. When I find it, I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2239" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老人打开门。“如您所愿，我好像就放在这哪儿，总之书一找到，我即刻差人送到您房间去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2240');"><p>"You have been most courteous," Ned told him. Then, almost as an afterthought, he said, "One last question, if you would be so kind. You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn’s bedside when he died. I wonder, was the queen with him?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2240" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您真是太周到了。”奈德告诉他。接着，他像突然想到什么似地说，“请您见谅，我还有最后一个问题。您刚才说艾林大人临终时国王在他床边，呃，不知当时王后在不在场？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2241');"><p>"Why, no," Pycelle said. "She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company with her father. Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day, no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion’s crown. In that he was sadly disappointed. It fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn’s sudden death. Never have I sent off a bird with a heavier heart."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2241" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“唉，不在哪。”派席尔说，“当时她正带着公主王子，陪着她父亲，前往凯岩城。先前泰温大人带上大队人马前来都城参加乔佛里王子的命名日比武大会，无疑是想看他儿子詹姆赢得冠军，可惜没能如愿。通知王后陛下艾林大人死讯的事，便落到了我身上。我这辈子从没有怀着如此沉重的心情送出一只鸟儿。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2242');"><p>"Dark wings, dark words," Ned murmured. It was a proverb Old Nan had taught him as a boy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2242" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“黑色的翅膀，带来黑色的消息。”奈德喃喃道。这是小时候老奶妈教他的一句谚语。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2243');"><p>"So the fishwives say," Grand Maester Pycelle agreed, "but we know it is not always so. When Maester Luwin’s bird brought the word about your Bran, the message lifted every true heart in the castle, did it not?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2243" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“民间是这么说的，”派席尔总师同意，“但我们知道也不尽然。鲁温学士的鸟儿捎来贵公子布兰的好消息时，可不是让城里每个人都欢欣雀跃么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2244');"><p>"As you say, Maester."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2244" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大学士，您说得对。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2245');"><p>"The gods are merciful." Pycelle bowed his head. "Come to me as often as you like, Lord Eddard. I am here to serve."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2245" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸神慈悲，”派席尔点点头。“艾德大人，有什么事请尽管来找我，我随时听候差遣。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2246');"><p>Yes, Ned thought as the door swung shut, but whom?
</p></origin><translate id="div_2246" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>是啊，奈德在门关上时想着，但是听候谁的差遣呢？ 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2247');"><p>On the way back to his chambers, he came upon his daughter Arya on the winding steps of the Tower of the Hand, windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg. The rough stone had scuffed her bare feet. Ned stopped and looked at her. "Arya, what are you doing?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2247" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>回房途中，他见到女儿艾莉亚单脚站在首相塔的螺旋梯上，两手不断挥舞保持平衡。粗糙的石地面磨破了她的脚丫。奈德停下来看她。“艾莉亚，你这是在做什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2248');"><p>"Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours." Her hands flailed at the air to steady herself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2248" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“西利欧说水舞者可以用一只脚趾站好几个小时。”她两手在空中拚命挥舞，以保持平衡。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2249');"><p>Ned had to smile. "Which toe?" he teased.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2249" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德忍俊不禁。“哪只脚趾头？”他揶揄道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2250');"><p>"Any toe," Arya said, exasperated with the question. She hopped from her right leg to her left, swaying dangerously before she regained her balance.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2250" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“随便哪一只都可以。”艾莉亚为这个问题而恼怒。她从右脚跳到左脚，颤巍巍地来回晃动，最后才重新找到平衡。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2251');"><p>"Must you do your standing here?" he asked. "It’s a long hard fall down these steps."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2251" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你非站在这里不可？”他问，“又高又陡，跌下去可不好玩。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2255');"><p>Ned knelt beside her. "He has years to find that answer, Arya. For now, it is enough to know that he will live." The night the bird had come from Winterfell, Eddard Stark had taken the girls to the castle godswood, an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the river. The heart tree there was a great oak, its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines; they knelt before it to offer their thanksgiving, as if it had been a weirwood. Sansa drifted to sleep as the moon rose, Arya several hours later, curling up in the grass under Ned’s cloak. All through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone. When dawn broke over the city, the dark red blooms of dragon’s breath surrounded the girls where they lay. "I dreamed of Bran," Sansa had whispered to him. "I saw him smiling."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2256');"><p>"He was going to be a knight," Arya was saying now. "A knight of the Kingsguard. Can he still be a knight?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2256" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他以后会当上骑士，”这会儿艾莉亚说，“当上御林铁卫的骑士。他还能当骑士吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2257');"><p>"No," Ned said. He saw no use in lying to her. "Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king’s council. He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea, or enter your mother’s Faith and become the High Septon." But he will never run beside his wolf again, he thought with a sadness too deep for words, or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his arms.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2257" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不行。”奈德自觉说谎无益。“有朝一日他或能身居高位，成为国王的重臣。他可能会像’筑城者‘布兰登那样兴建城堡，可能乘船横渡日落之海，或是皈依你母亲的信仰，当上总主教。”然而他再也不能和他的狼一并奔驰，他沉痛地想，这悲伤无言可喻，他也无法和女人同床共枕、抱着自己亲生孩儿了。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2259');"><p>"You," Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, "will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2259" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你啊，”奈德说着轻轻吻了她的眉毛。“你会嫁给某个国王，管理他的城堡，你的儿子们则会当上骑士、王子或领主，或许也能当上大主教。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2260');"><p>Arya screwed up her face. "No," she said, "that’s Sansa." She folded up her right leg and resumed her balancing. Ned sighed and left her there.

</p></origin><translate id="div_2261" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>进到房间，他脱下汗水浸湿的丝臼上衣，从床边的水盆里掬起冷水当头淋下。正当他擦脸的时候，埃林进来说：“老爷，贝里席大人在外求见。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2262');"><p>"Escort him to my solar," Ned said, reaching for a fresh tunic, the lightest linen he could find. "I’ll see him at once."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2263');"><p>Littlefinger was perched on the window seat when Ned entered, watching the knights of the Kingsguard practice at swords in the yard below.

</p></origin><translate id="div_2263" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当奈德跨进书房，发现小指头正坐在窗边，望着在下方广场练剑的御林铁卫。“老赛尔弥的脑袋瓜要跟他的剑一样灵光就好了，”他满怀渴望地说，“那样开会会有趣许多。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2264');"><p>"Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in King’s Landing." Ned had come to have a deep respect for the aged, white-haired Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2264" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“巴利斯坦爵士的武勇和操守，不输给君临的任何人。”经过这些日子的相处，奈德对这位德高望重，白发苍苍的御林铁卫队长抱持着崇高的敬意。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2265');"><p>"And as tiresome," Littlefinger added, "though I daresay he should do well in the tourney. Last year he unhorsed the Hound, and it was only four years ago that he was champion."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2265" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他的死气沉沉也同样不落人后。”小指头补充道，“不过我相信他在比武大会上应该还能老当益壮，发挥余热。去年他把猎狗一枪刺下马，距离他上次摘下冠军也不过四年。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2266');"><p>The question of who might win the tourney interested Eddard Stark not in the least. "Is there a reason for this visit, Lord Petyr, or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2266" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>对于谁会夺得比武大会冠军，艾德•史塔克一点兴趣也没有。“培提尔大人，请问您这次来访有何目的，还是单只来欣赏我窗边景致？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2267');"><p>Littlefinger smiled. "I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries, and so I have."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2268');"><p>That took Ned aback. Promise or no promise, he could not find it in him to trust Lord Petyr Baelish, who struck him as too clever by half. "You have something for me?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2268" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德大感意外。不论对方有无承诺，他都不打算相信培提尔•贝里席伯爵，他的机灵狡诈让他很不习惯。“你查到了什么事？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2269');"><p>"Someone," Littlefinger corrected. "Four someones, if truth be told. Had you thought to question the Hand’s servants?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2269" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我查到的是人，不是事。”小指头纠正他。“事实上，是四个人。你有没有想过去盘查首相的仆人？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2270');"><p>Ned frowned. "Would that I could. Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie." Lysa had done him no favor in that regard. All those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when she fled: Jon’s maester, his steward, the captain of his guard, his knights and retainers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2270" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德皱眉道：“如果我能就好了。艾林夫人把她全家上下都带回了鹰巢城。”在这方面莱莎一点忙也没帮上，所有跟她丈夫亲近的人都随她一道逃走：包括琼恩的学士、总管、侍卫队长，以及手下的骑士和仆从。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2271');"><p>"Most of her household," Littlefinger said, "not all. A few remain. A pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to one of Lord Renly’s grooms, a stablehand who joined the City Watch, a potboy discharged from service for theft, and Lord Arryn’s squire."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2271" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不对，是大部分的人，”小指头说，“并非全部。有几个人留了下来。有个肚子被搞大的厨房小妹匆匆忙忙跟蓝礼大人的马夫成了亲，一个马僮加入了都城守卫队，一个跑堂小弟因为偷窃被炒了鱿鱼，留下来的还有艾林大人的侍从。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2272');"><p>"His squire?" Ned was pleasantly surprised. A man’s squire often knew a great deal of his comings and goings.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2272" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他的侍从？”奈德喜出望外，做侍从的对主子的进出动向往往一清二楚。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2273');"><p>"Ser Hugh of the Vale," Littlefinger named him. "The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryn’s death."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2273" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“峡谷的修夫爵士，”小指头说出他的名字，“艾林大人死后，国王封那小子做了骑士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2274');"><p>"I shall send for him," Ned said. "And the others."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2275');"><p>Littlefinger winced. "My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be so kind."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2275" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头畏缩着说：“大人，劳烦您，悄悄地走到窗边。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2276');"><p>"Why?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2276" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“做什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2277');"><p>"Come, and I’ll show you, my lord."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2278');"><p>Frowning, Ned crossed to the window. Petyr Baelish made a casual gesture. "There, across the yard, at the door of the armory, do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2278" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德皱起眉头，走到窗边。培提尔•贝里席若无其事地做了个手势。“那儿，广场过去，兵器库门口，您可看见一个蹲在楼梯上磨刀的小子？”

</p></origin><translate id="div_2279" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他怎么了？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2280');"><p>"He reports to Varys. The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings." He shifted in the window seat. "Now glance at the wall. Farther west, above the stables. The guardsman leaning on the ramparts?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2280" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他是瓦里斯的眼线。‘八爪蜘蛛’对您的一举一动都很有兴趣。”他在窗边动了动。“现在再瞧瞧城墙上，西边最远处，马厩上面，有没有看见那个靠在墙上的守卫？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2281');"><p>Ned saw the man. "Another of the eunuch’s whisperers?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2281" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德看到了。“这人也是太监的走狗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2282');"><p>"No, this one belongs to the queen. Notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower, the better to note who calls on you. There are others, many unknown even to me. The Red Keep is full of eyes. Why do you think I hid Cat in a brothel?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2282" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，这家伙是王后的人。请您注意，他的视线正好落在这座塔的门上，谁进谁出一清二楚。他们俩远不是全部，很多连我都不知晓。红堡里到处是各种眼线。否则我干嘛把凯特藏在妓院？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2283');"><p>Eddard Stark had no taste for these intrigues. "Seven hells," he swore. It did seem as though the man on the walls was watching him. Suddenly uncomfortable, Ned moved away from the window. "Is everyone someone’s informer in this cursed city?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2283" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾德•史塔克对这种种机心巧诈颇感不耐。“天杀的，”他咒道。城墙上那个人看起来的确像在监视他。奈德顿时觉得浑身不自在，既便离开窗边。“难道这该死的城里每个人都是别人的眼线？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2284');"><p>"Scarcely," said Littlefinger. He counted on the fingers on his hand. "Why, there’s me, you, the king?.?.?.?although, come to think on it, the king tells the queen much too much, and I’m less than certain about you." He stood up. "Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2284" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那可不，”小指头说。他开始掰手指。“唉，让我算算，他们得监视我、你、国王……不过国王把太多事都告诉了王后，而我对你更不敢放心。”他站起来。“你手下可有让你完全、彻底地信任的人？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2285');"><p>"Yes," said Ned.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2285" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有。”奈德回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2286');"><p>"In that case, I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you," Littlefinger said with a mocking smile. "The wiser answer was no, my lord, but be that as it may. Send this paragon of yours to Ser Hugh and the others. Your own comings and goings will be noted, but even Varys the Spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day." He started for the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2286" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“若真是如此，那我还有一座建在瓦雷利亚，爱不释手的漂亮皇宫想卖给您呢。”小指头一脸嘲讽地笑道，“聪明的回答是：没有，大人，不过既然说了就算了。您得派您这位模范部下去找修夫爵士和其他人，因为您自己的行踪会引人注目，但就算 ‘八爪蜘蛛’瓦里斯也没法无时无刻、成天盯住你的每位手下。”他朝门走去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2287');"><p>"Lord Petyr," Ned called after him. "I?.?.?.?am grateful for your help. Perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2287" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“培提尔大人，”奈德叫住他，“我……很感激你的鼎力相助。或许我不应该不信任你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2288');"><p>Littlefinger fingered his small pointed beard. "You are slow to learn, Lord Eddard. Distrusting me was the wisest thing you’ve done since you climbed down off your horse."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2288" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小指头轻捻胡须：“艾德大人，您实在学得太慢。不信任我，是你跳下马背以来所做过的最明臹的事。”
