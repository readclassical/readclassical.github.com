</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6443');"><p>They have my son," Tywin Lannister said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6443" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我儿子在他们手上。”泰温•兰尼斯特说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6444');"><p>"They do, my lord." The messenger’s voice was dulled by exhaustion. On the breast of his torn surcoat, the brindled boar of Crakehall was half-obscured by dried blood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6444" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，大人。”信使的声音因疲累而呆滞。在他破碎的无袖罩袍前胸部，干涸的血渍遮住了克雷赫家族的斑纹野猪。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6445');"><p>One of your sons, Tyrion thought. He took a sip of wine and said not a word, thinking of Jaime. When he lifted his arm, pain shot through his elbow, reminding him of his own brief taste of battle. He loved his brother, but he would not have wanted to be with him in the Whispering Wood for all the gold in Casterly Rock.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6445" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>你两个儿子中的一个，提利昂心想。他啜了口酒，一言不发，心里想着詹姆。抬手之时，剧痛从肘部直冲脑际，提醒着他战场的滋味。他虽然爱哥哥，但就算给他全凯岩城的金子，他也不想和哥哥待在呓语森林。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6446');"><p>His lord father’s assembled captains and bannermen had fallen very quiet as the courier told his tale. The only sound was the crackle and hiss of the log burning in the hearth at the end of the long, drafty common room.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6446" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>父亲召集的诸侯和将领纷纷安静下来，听信使陈述事情经过。宽敞通风的旅馆长厅里，只有火炉中的柴薪在劈啪作响。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6447');"><p>After the hardships of the long relentless drive south, the prospect of even a single night in an inn had cheered Tyrion mightily?.?.?.?though he rather wished it had not been this inn again, with all its memories. His father had set a grueling pace, and it had taken its toll. Men wounded in the battle kept up as best they could or were abandoned to fend for themselves. Every morning they left a few more by the roadside, men who went to sleep never to wake. Every afternoon a few more collapsed along the way. And every evening a few more deserted, stealing off into the dusk. Tyrion had been half-tempted to go with them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6447" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>经历了长途的急行南下，想到可以在旅店稍作歇息，虽然只有一晚，依旧使提利昂大为振奋……只是他暗暗希望别要又是这家充满回忆的旅店。父亲严令他们以耗尽体力的速度行进，结果损失惨重。战争中的伤员如果不能跟上，就落得被抛下来自生自灭的下场。每天早上他们动身之时，总有些人倒在路边，睡着便再没醒来；下午，又有另一些人筋疲力竭地瘫在道旁；到得晚上，更有些人当了逃兵，遁进夜色之中，连提利昂本人都很想跟他们一起走。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6448');"><p>He had been upstairs, enjoying the comfort of a featherbed and the warmth of Shae’s body beside him, when his squire had woken him to say that a rider had arrived with dire news of Riverrun. So it had all been for nothing. The rush south, the endless forced marches, the bodies left beside the road?.?.?.?all for naught. Robb Stark had reached Riverrun days and days ago.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6448" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>片刻前，他人还在楼上，躺在柔软舒适的羽毛床上，怀抱雪伊温暖的身体。然而他的侍从匆匆跑来把他摇醒，报告说有人骑马带来奔流城方面的重大消息。他立刻明白他们是白跑了一躺。往南急奔，无止尽的急行军和弃于路边的尸体……全成了空。罗柏•史塔克早在好几天前便解了奔流城之围。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6449');"><p>"How could this happen?" Ser Harys Swyft moaned. "How? Even after the Whispering Wood, you had Riverrun ringed in iron, surrounded by a great host?.?.?.?what madness made Ser Jaime decide to split his men into three separate camps? Surely he knew how vulnerable that would leave them?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6449" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这怎么可能? ”哈瑞斯•史威佛爵士呻吟道，“怎么可能? 即便在呓语森林之战以后，奔流城依旧为大军团团包围……詹姆爵士到底在想什么，怎会把部队分为三处驻扎? 他总该清楚这样会有何风险吧?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6450');"><p>Better than you, you chinless craven, Tyrion thought. Jaime might have lost Riverrun, but it angered him to hear his brother slandered by the likes of Swyft, a shameless lickspittle whose greatest accomplishment was marrying his equally chinless daughter to Ser Kevan, and thereby attaching himself to the Lannisters.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6450" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他比你这没下巴的懦夫清楚多了，提利昂心想。纵然詹姆丢了奔流城，然而听见哥哥被史威佛这种人毁谤，依旧令他怒火中烧。吏威佛是个厚颜无耻的马屁精，他这辈子最大的成就，就是把他那个同样没下巴的女儿嫁给凯冯爵士，借此与兰尼斯特家族攀上亲戚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6451');"><p>"I would have done the same," his uncle responded, a good deal more calmly than Tyrion might have. "You have never seen Riverrun, Ser Harys, or you would know that Jaime had little choice in the matter. The castle is situated at the end of the point of land where the Tumblestone flows into the Red Fork of the Trident. The rivers form two sides of a triangle, and when danger threatens, the Tullys open their sluice gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side, turning Riverrun into an island. The walls rise sheer from the water, and from their towers the defenders have a commanding view of the opposite shores for many leagues around. To cut off all the approaches, a besieger must needs place one camp north of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and a third between the rivers, west of the moat. There is no other way, none."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6451" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“换我也会这么做，”叔叔应道，提利昂若是开口，绝不会如他这般冷静。“哈瑞斯爵士，您没见过奔流城，不然您一定会清楚詹姆别无选择。奔流城座落于腾石河汇流进三叉戟河的支流红叉河的三角洲尖端，河流构成了三角形的两边，而一旦遇到危险，徒利家便打开上游的闸门，在第三边造出宽阔的护城河，将奔流城变为河中孤岛。城墙自水中高高拔起，守军自塔楼上可以看清对岸数里格之内的所有事物。若要切断各方支援，攻城方必须在腾石河北岸、红叉河南岸以及护城河西岸，亦即两条河之间，各放置一支军队。除此之外，别无他法。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6452');"><p>"Ser Kevan speaks truly, my lords," the courier said. "We’d built palisades of sharpened stakes around the camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and the rivers cutting us off from each other. They came down on the north camp first. No one was expecting an attack. Marq Piper had been raiding our supply trains, but he had no more than fifty men. Ser Jaime had gone out to deal with them the night before?.?.?.?well, with what we thought was them. We were told the Stark host was east of the Green Fork, marching south?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6452" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸位大人，凯冯爵士说得没错，”信使说，“我军已在营地周围密布削尖木栅，但在没有任何预警，河水又把我们的营地互相切断的情况下，这样的准备远远不够。他们首先袭击北方的营地，时机完全出乎我们的意料。先前，马柯•派柏不断骚扰我军的补给车队，但他手下只有五六十人。遭受攻击的前一晚，詹姆爵士亲自带兵去对付他们……唉，当时我们以为目辬就是派柏那伙人。我们听说史塔克军还在绿叉河东岸，正朝南而去……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6453');"><p>"And your outriders?" Ser Gregor Clegane’s face might have been hewn from rock. The fire in the hearth gave a somber orange cast to his skin and put deep shadows in the hollows of his eyes. "They saw nothing? They gave you no warning?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6453" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们的斥候呢?”格雷果•克里冈爵士的脸活像石雕，火光为他的皮肤罩上了一层阴森的橙色，在他的眼眶底投下深深的阴影。“莫非他们什么都没看到?没给你们任何警讯? ”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6454');"><p>The bloodstained messenger shook his head. "Our outriders had been vanishing. Marq Piper’s work, we thought. The ones who did come back had seen nothing."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6454" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>满身血污的信使摇摇头。“我们的侦察部队最近不断失踪，我们以为是马柯•派柏搞的鬼。而偶尔回来的人又说什么也没发现。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6455');"><p>"A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes," the Mountain declared. "Cut them out and give them to your next outrider. Tell him you hope that four eyes might see better than two?.?.?.?and if not, the man after him will have six."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6455" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“什么也发现不了表示他用不着眼睛，”魔山宣布，“把他们的眼睛挖出来，交给替补的斥候，告诉他：希望四只眼睛可以比两只眼睛看得清楚……如果他还是不行，那么下一个人就会有六只眼睛了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6456');"><p>Lord Tywin Lannister turned his face to study Ser Gregor. Tyrion saw a glimmer of gold as the light shone off his father’s pupils, but he could not have said whether the look was one of approval or disgust. Lord Tywin was oft quiet in council, preferring to listen before he spoke, a habit Tyrion himself tried to emulate. Yet this silence was uncharacteristic even for him, and his wine was untouched.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6456" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>泰温•兰尼斯特公爵转头审视格雷果爵士，提利昂看到父亲瞳中金光一闪，但他说不准那是赞许抑或嫌恶。泰温公爵在会议上通常保持缄默，宁可在发言前先倾听别人的意见，提利昂一直很想仿效他这个习惯。然而就算是父亲，如此沉默也很不寻常，他连酒都没碰。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6457');"><p>"You said they came at night," Ser Kevan prompted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6457" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说他们发动夜袭?”凯冯爵士提问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6458');"><p>The man gave a weary nod. "The Blackfish led the van, cutting down our sentries and clearing away the palisades for the main assault. By the time our men knew what was happening, riders were pouring over the ditch banks and galloping through the camp with swords and torches in hand. I was sleeping in the west camp, between the rivers. When we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired, Lord Brax led us to the rafts and we tried to pole across, but the current pushed us downstream and the Tullys started flinging rocks at us with the catapults on their walls. I saw one raft smashed to kindling and three others overturned, men swept into the river and drowned?.?.?.?and those who did make it across found the Starks waiting for them on the riverbanks."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6458" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>来人疲累地点点头。“前锋由黑鱼率领，砍倒我们的卫兵，清除栅栏，以利主力攻击。等我们的人醒悟过来，对方骑兵已经跃过沟渠，手执刀剑和火把冲进了营区。我睡在西寨，就是两条河之间的地方。我们这边的人听到打斗，看见帐篷着火，布拉克斯大人便领着大家上了木筏•，想划到对岸去援救。然而水流湍急，直把我们往下游冲，徒利家的守军发现后，便用城墙上的投石机发动轰击。我亲眼看到一艘木筏被砸得稀烂，另外三艘翻倒，上面的人都被卷进河里淹死……而好不容易过河的人，却发现史塔克军正在对岸等着他们。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6459');"><p>Ser Flement Brax wore a silver-and-purple tabard and the look of a man who cannot comprehend what he has just heard. "My lord father..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6459" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>佛列蒙•布拉克斯爵士穿着一件银紫相间的罩袍，脸上露出难以置信的表情。“我父亲，我父亲大人他——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6460');"><p>"Sorry, my lord," the messenger said. "Lord Brax was clad in plate-and-mail when his raft overturned. He was very gallant."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6460" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，我很遗憾。”信使说，“布拉克斯大人的筏子翻船时，他穿戴着全身铠和锁甲。他是个勇士。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6461');"><p>He was a fool, Tyrion thought, swirling his cup and staring down into the winy depths. Crossing a river at night on a crude raft, wearing armor, with an enemy waiting on the other side, if that was gallantry, he would take cowardice every time. He wondered if Lord Brax had felt especially gallant as the weight of his steel pulled him under the black water.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6461" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他是个蠢蛋，提利昂心想，一边摇晃酒杯，朝杯中的漩涡望去。大半夜的，全副武装，乘着简陋的木筏穿过急流，朝对岸严阵以待的敌人扑去——假如这叫做勇士，他宁可每次都当懦夫。不知布拉克斯伯爵被沉重的盔甲拖进漆黑的深水时，有没有觉得特别英勇啊?
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6462');"><p>"The camp between the rivers was overrun as well," the messenger was saying. "While we were trying to cross, more Starks swept in from the west, two columns of armored horse. I saw Lord Umber’s giant-in-chains and the Mallister eagle, but it was the boy who led them, with a monstrous wolf running at his side. I wasn’t there to see, but it’s said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen horses. Our spearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against their first charge, but when the Tullys saw them engaged, they opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos Blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge and took them in the rear."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6462" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“随后，两河之间的营地也被敌人攻陷，”信使续道，“我们忙着渡河时，史塔克军的重骑兵排成两个纵队，从西边杀出。我看到安柏伯爵的碎链巨人旗和梅利斯特家族的老鹰纹章，但最可怕的却是那个带头的小鬼，他身边跟了一头怪物似的狼。我没和他们交手，听说那只怪物杀了四个活人，咬死十几匹马。后来我军的长枪兵组成盾墙，挡住他们的第一次冲锋，谁料徒利家一看咱们无暇他顾，便打开奔流城门，由泰陀斯•布莱伍德率军渡过吊桥出击，偷袭我军后方。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6463');"><p>"Gods save us," Lord Lefford swore.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6463" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸神保佑。”莱佛德伯爵咒道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6464');"><p>"Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, and Lord Blackwood found Ser Edmure Tully in chains among the other captives, and made off with them all. Our south camp was under the command of Ser Forley Prester. He retreated in good order when he saw that the other camps were lost, with two thousand spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led his freeriders struck his banners and went over to the foe."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6464" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大琼恩•安柏放火烧了我们辛苦建造的攻城塔，布莱伍德大人则找到了被我们锁起来的艾德慕•徒利爵士以及其他战俘，并将他们通通救走。南寨由佛勒•普莱斯特爵士指挥，眼见相邻的阵地纷纷失守，他便率领手下两千枪兵和两千弓箭手井井有条地向西撤退了，但那掌管自由骑手的泰洛西佣兵却砍断旗臶，投靠了敌方。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6465');"><p>"Curse the man." His uncle Kevan sounded more angry than surprised. "I warned Jaime not to trust that one. A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6465" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“该死的家伙，”凯冯叔叔的口气不仅惊讶，更加愤怒。“我早警告过詹姆别相信这混蛋，为钱而战的人只会为自己的腰包卖命。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6466');"><p>Lord Tywin wove his fingers together under his chin. Only his eyes moved as he listened. His bristling golden side-whiskers framed a face so still it might have been a mask, but Tyrion could see tiny beads of sweat dappling his father’s shaven head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6466" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>泰温公爵十指交叉，顶着下巴，倾听时只有眼睛在动。他两颊的金黄短须围出一张纹丝不动的脸，活像一张面具。然而，提利昂注意到父亲的光头上密布细小汗珠。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6467');"><p>"How could it happen?" Ser Harys Swyft wailed again. "Ser Jaime taken, the siege broken?.?.?.?this is a catastrophe!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6467" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这怎么可能?”哈瑞斯•史威佛爵士再度哀嚎。“詹姆爵士被俘，围城军队又遭击溃……简直是大难临头!” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6468');"><p>Ser Addam Marbrand said, "I am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing out the obvious, Ser Harys. The question is, what shall we do about it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6468" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>亚当•马尔布兰爵士道：“哈瑞斯爵士，我们都很感激您指出显而易见的事实，但眼下的当务之急是，我们下一步该怎么走?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6469');"><p>"What can we do? Jaime’s host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight, and the Starks and the Tullys sit squarely across our line of supply. We are cut off from the west! They can march on Casterly Rock if they so choose, and what’s to stop them? My lords, we are beaten. We must sue for peace."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6469" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还能怎么样?詹姆的军队不是被杀、被俘就是逃散，而史塔克家与徒利家的部队正好扼住我们的补给线，我们与西边的联系完全被切断了!他们甚至可以大摇大摆地进军凯岩城，谁又能阻止他们呢?诸位大人，我们战败了，应该立刻求和。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6470');"><p>"Peace?" Tyrion swirled his wine thoughtfully, took a deep draft, and hurled his empty cup to the floor, where it shattered into a thousand pieces. "There’s your peace, Ser Harys. My sweet nephew broke it for good and all when he decided to ornament the Red Keep with Lord Eddard’s head. You’ll have an easier time drinking wine from that cup than you will convincing Robb Stark to make peace now. He’s winning?.?.?.?or hadn’t you noticed?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6470" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“求和?”提利昂若有所思地晃着酒杯，一饮而尽，随后将空杯往地上一掷，摔成千百碎片。 “哈瑞斯爵士，这就是求和的结果。打从我那好外甥决定拿艾德大人的头来装饰红堡的那一刻起，所有和谈的机会都粉碎了。眼下要跟罗柏•史塔克求和，比用地下这破杯装酒还难。占上风的是他……难道您没发现?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6471');"><p>"Two battles do not make a war," Ser Addam insisted. "We are far from lost. I should welcome the chance to try my own steel against this Stark boy."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6471" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“两场战役的胜负并不能决定整个战争的成败，”亚当爵士坚持，“我们还远远没有战败。我很乐意跟这史塔克小鬼在战场上亲自较量较量。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6472');"><p>"Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs," offered Lord Lefford.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6472" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“或许他们会答应暂时停战，以便双方交换人臼。”莱佛德伯爵提议。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6473');"><p>"Unless they trade three-for-one, we still come out light on those scales," Tyrion said acidly. "And what are we to offer for my brother? Lord Eddard’s rotting head?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6473" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“除非他们愿意三个换一个——这样我们都嫌不够咧。”提利昂尖酸地说，“再说了，我们拿谁去换我哥哥? 拿艾德大人烂掉的头么?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6474');"><p>"I had heard that Queen Cersei has the Hand’s daughters," Lefford said hopefully. "If we give the lad his sisters back?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_6474" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“听说瑟曦太后手上握有首相的两个女儿，”莱佛德满怀希望地说，“假如我们提出把这小子的妹妹还给他……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6475');"><p>Ser Addam snorted disdainfully. "He would have to be an utter ass to trade Jaime Lannister’s life for two girls."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6475" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>亚当爵士轻蔑地哼了一声。“他疯了才拿詹姆•兰尼斯特的命来换两个小女生。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6476');"><p>"Then we must ransom Ser Jaime, whatever it costs," Lord Lefford said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6476" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那就把詹姆爵士赎回来，不管花多少金子。”莱佛德伯爵道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6477');"><p>Tyrion rolled his eyes. "If the Starks feel the need for gold, they can melt down Jaime’s armor."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6477" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂翻起白眼。“史塔克家要真那么缺钱，把詹姆的盔甲拿去熔掉不就得啦。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6478');"><p>"if we ask for a truce, they will think us weak," Ser Addarn argued. "We should march on them at once."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6478" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们求和，他们就会看轻我们。”亚当爵士争辩，“依我之见，我们应该立刻进兵。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6479');"><p>"Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops," said Ser Harys. "And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6479" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯，想必我们宫中的朋友会乐意提供补充兵力，”哈瑞斯爵士说，“同时也应当派人回凯岩城组织新军。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6480');"><p>Lord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet. "They have my son," he said once more, in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet. "Leave me. All of you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6480" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，泰温•兰尼斯特公爵霍地起身。“我儿子在他们手上!”他重复了一辫，声音穿透众声喧哗，宛如利剑划破油脂。“退下，统统退下。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6481');"><p>Ever the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but his father gave him a look. "Not you, Tyrion. Remain. And you as well, Kevan. The rest of you, out."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6481" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂向来习于听命，于是他立即起身，准备和其他人一起离去。但父亲看了他一眼，“不，提利昂，你留下。凯冯，你也是。其他人给我出去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6482');"><p>Tyrion eased himself back onto the bench, startled into speechlessness. Ser Kevan crossed the room to the wine casks. "Uncle," Tyrion called, "if you would be so kind..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_6482" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂坐回板凳，惊讶得说不出话来。凯冯爵士穿过房间，走到酒桶边。“叔叔，”提利昂叫道，“可否麻烦您——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6483');"><p>"Here." His father offered him his cup, the wine untouched.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6483" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“拿去。”父亲把自己面前那杯一动未动的酒递给他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6484');"><p>Now Tyrion truly was nonplussed. He drank.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6484" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这下提利昂真有些不知所措。他只有喝的份。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6485');"><p>Lord Tywin seated himself. "You have the right of it about Stark. Alive, we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert’s brothers. Dead?.?.?.?" His hand curled into a fist. "Madness. Rank madness."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6511');"><p>"Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow," Tyrion commented, "but I should prefer to keep them with me."

What sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next? Whose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a lord? The man’s father was a butcher, and they grant him Harrenhal. Harrenhal, that was the seat of kings! Not that he will ever set foot inside it, if I have a say. I am told he took a bloody spear for his sigil. A bloody cleaver would have been my choice." His father had not raised his voice, yet Tyrion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes. "And dismissing Selmy, where was the sense in that? Yes, the man was old, but the name of Barristan the Bold still has meaning in the realm. He lent honor to any man he served. Can anyone say the same of the Hound? You feed your dog bones under the table, you do not seat him beside you on the high bench." He pointed a finger at Tyrion’s face.
