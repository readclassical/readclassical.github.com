</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_477');"><p>Of all the rooms in Winterfell’s Great Keep, Catelyn’s bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to light a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man’s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_477" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在临冬城主堡所有的房间里，就属凯特琳的卧室最是闷热，以至于当时鲜少有生火取暖的必要。城堡立基于天然的温泉之上，蒸腾热水如同人体内的血液般流贯高墙寝室，将寒意驱出石材大厅，使玻璃花园充满湿气与暖意，让土壤不致结冻。十几个较小的露天庭院中，温泉日夜蒸腾。夏日里，这或许无足轻重，但到了冬季，却往往是生与死的差别。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_478');"><p>Catelyn’s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The warmth reminded her of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place.
</p></origin><translate id="div_478" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳喜欢把洗澡水弄得滚烫臽热、蒸汽四溢，而她选择的居室四周墙壁摸起来也一向很温暖。只因这种温暖能勾起她对于奔流城的回忆，让她想起那段在艳阳底下，与莱莎和艾德慕嘻闹奔逐的日子，只是奈德始终无法忍受这种热度。他总告诉她，史塔克家族的人生来就要与冰天雪地为伍，而她也总会笑答：倘若真是这样，那么他们的城堡真是盖错了地方。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_479');"><p>So when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. He crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by one, letting the night air into the chamber.
</p></origin><translate id="div_479" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>所以，当他们完事之后，奈德便翻过身，从她床上爬起来，如以前千百次一样走过房间，拉开厚重的织锦帷幕，把高处的窄窗一扇扇推开，让夜里的寒意灌进卧房。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_480');"><p>The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she had wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years gone. Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking. It was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. She prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old. She could give him another son.
</p></origin><translate id="div_480" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他静静伫立窗边，全身赤裸，手无长物，独向漫天的幽暗长空，冷风在他身边穿梭呼啸。凯特琳拉过温暖的毛皮，盖到下巴，默默地看着丈夫，觉得他看起来似乎变得瘦小又脆弱，仿佛突然之间又成了那个自己十五年前在奔流城圣堂托付一生的年轻人。她的下体仍然因为刚才他剧烈的动作而疼痛，但这是一种感觉美好的疼痛，她可以感觉到他的种子在自己体内。她祈祷种子能开花结果。生完瑞肯已是三年前的事了，她年纪还轻，可以再为他添个儿子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_481');"><p>"I will refuse him," Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt.
</p></origin><translate id="div_481" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我拒绝他就是。”他边说边转身面向她，眼神阴霾不开，语调充满疑虑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_482');"><p>Catelyn sat up in the bed. "You cannot. You must not."
</p></origin><translate id="div_482" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳从床上坐起来：“不行，你不能拒绝。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_483');"><p>"My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert’s Hand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_483" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我的责任在这里、在北方，我无意接任劳勃的首相一职。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_484');"><p>"He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. If you refuse to serve him, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him. Can’t you see the danger that would put us in?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_484" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他才不懂这些，他现在是国王了，国王可不能当常人看待。倘若你拒绝了他，他定会纳闷其原因，随后迟早会怀疑你是否包藏二心。你难道看不出拒绝之后，可能为我们带来的危险吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_485');"><p>Ned shook his head, refusing to believe. "Robert would never harm me or any of mine. We were closer than brothers. He loves me. If I refuse him, he will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will laugh about it together. I know the man!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_485" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德摇摇头：“劳勃绝不会做出对我或我家人不利的事。他爱我更胜亲兄弟，假如我拒绝，他会暴跳如雷，骂不绝口，但一个星期之后我们便会对这件事嗤之以鼻。他这个人我清楚！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_486');"><p>"You knew the man," she said. "The king is a stranger to you." Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat. She had to make him see. "Pride is everything to a king, my lord. Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw them back in his face."
</p></origin><translate id="div_486" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你清楚的是过去的他，”她答道，“现在的国王对你来言，已经成了陌生人。”凯特琳想起倒卧雪地的那头冰原狼，想起喉咙里深插的鹿角。她得想办法让他认清事实。“大人，国王的自尊是他的一切，劳勃不远千里来看望你，为你带来如此至高无上的荣誉，你说什么也不能断然拒绝，这等于当众摔他一个耳光呀。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_487');"><p>"Honors?" Ned laughed bitterly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_487" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“荣誉？”奈德苦涩地笑道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_488');"><p>"In his eyes, yes," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_488" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在他眼里，没有更高的荣誉了。”她回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_489');"><p>"And in yours?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_489" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在你眼里呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_490');"><p>"And in mine," she blazed, angry now. Why couldn’t he see? "He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen. Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne. What is so wrong with that?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_490" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“在我眼里也一样！”她叱道，突然间生气起来。他为什么就不懂呢？“他愿意让自己的长子迎娶珊莎，还有什么能比这更光荣？珊莎有朝一日说不定会成为王后，她的孩子们将统治北起绝境长城，南及多恩峻岭的辽阔土地，这难道不好么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_491');"><p>"Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven," Ned said. "And Joffrey?.?.?.?Joffrey is?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_491" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“老天，凯特琳，珊莎才十一岁，”奈德说，“而乔佛里……乔佛里他……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_492');"><p>She finished for him. "?.?.?.?crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_492" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她忙接口：“他是当今王太子，铁王座的继承人。我父亲将我许配给你哥哥布兰登的时候，我也不过十二岁。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_493');"><p>That brought a bitter twist to Ned’s mouth. "Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King’s Hand and a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_493" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这话引起了奈德嘴角苦涩的牵动，“布兰登，是啊，布兰登知道怎么做，他做什么都充满自信，成竹在胸。你和临冬城本来都该是布兰登的。他是个当首相和作王后父亲的料。我可从没说过要喝这杯苦酒。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_494');"><p>"Perhaps not," Catelyn said, "but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, like it or not."
</p></origin><translate id="div_494" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“也许你没有，”凯特琳说，“但布兰登早已不在人世，酒杯也已经传到你手中，不管喜不喜欢，你都非喝不可。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_495');"><p>Ned turned away from her, back to the night. He stood staring out in the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the wall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_495" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德再度转身，返回暗夜之中。他站在原地望着屋外的黑暗，或许在凝视月光星辰，或许在了望城上哨兵。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_496');"><p>Catelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon’s place, as custom decreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the woman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son.
</p></origin><translate id="div_496" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>见他受了伤，凯特琳缓和下来。依照习俗，艾德•史塔克代替布兰登娶了她，然而他过世兄长的阴影仍旧夹在两人之间，就像另一个女人的阴影，一个他不愿说出名字，却为他生下私生子的女人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_497');"><p>She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected. Ned turned, frowning. "What is it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_497" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她正准备起身走到他身旁，敲门声却突然传来，在这样的时刻显得尤为刺耳，出乎意料。奈德回身，皱眉道：“是谁？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_498');"><p>Desmond’s voice came through the door. "My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent audience."
</p></origin><translate id="div_498" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>戴斯蒙的声音从门外传来：“老爷，鲁温学士在外面，说有急事求见。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_499');"><p>"You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_499" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你有没跟他讲，我交代不准任何人打扰？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_500');"><p>"Yes, my lord. He insists."
</p></origin><translate id="div_500" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有的，老爷，不过他坚持要见您一面。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_501');"><p>"Very well. Send him in."
</p></origin><translate id="div_501" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好罢，让他进来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_502');"><p>Ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had become. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. "Perhaps we should close the windows," she suggested.
</p></origin><translate id="div_502" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德走到衣橱前，披上一件厚重的长袍。凯特琳这才突然惊觉到屋里的寒意，她在床上坐起身子，把毛毯拉到下巴。“我们是不是该把窗子关起来？”她建议。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_503');"><p>Ned nodded absently. Maester Luwin was shown in.
</p></origin><translate id="div_503" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德心不在焉地点点头，鲁温学士已经被带进来了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_504');"><p>The maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. His hair was grey, what little the years had left him. His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors. Its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he kept hidden in his sleeves, Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift his arms at all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_504" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>学士是个瘦小的人，一身灰色。他的眼睛是灰色，但眼神敏锐，少有东西能逃过他的注意；岁月给他残留的头发也是灰的；他的长袍是灰色羊毛织成的，镶滚着白色绒边，正是史塔克家的色彩。宽大的袖子里藏有许许多多的口袋，鲁温总是忙不迭地把东西放进袖子，不时能从里面拿出书、信笺、古怪的法器、孩子们的玩具等等。想到鲁温师傅袖子里放了那么多东西，凯特琳很惊讶他的手还能活动。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_505');"><p>The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. "My lord," he said to Ned, "pardon for disturbing your rest. I have been left a message."
</p></origin><translate id="div_505" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>学士直等到身后的门关上之后方才开口：“老爷，”他对奈德说，“请原谅我打扰你们休息，有人留给我一封信。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_506');"><p>Ned looked irritated. "Been left? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was not told."
</p></origin><translate id="div_506" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德面带愠色地问：“有人留给你一封信？谁留的？今天有信使来过？我如何不知情？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_507');"><p>"There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I napped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king’s party. We have had no other visitors from the south."
</p></origin><translate id="div_507" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“老爷，不是信使带来的。有人趁我打盹时，把一个雕工精巧的木盒放在我观星室的书桌上。我的仆人说没看到人进出，但想来一定是跟国王一道的人留下的，我们没有其他从南方来的访客。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_508');"><p>"A wooden box, you say?" Catelyn said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_508" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说是个木盒子？”凯特琳问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_509');"><p>"Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal."
</p></origin><translate id="div_509" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“里面装了个精美的透镜，专用于观星，看来应该是密尔的做工。密尔产的透镜可称举世无双。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_510');"><p>Ned frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. "A lens," he said. "What has that to do with me?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_510" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德又皱起眉头，凯特琳知道他对这类琐事一向毫无耐性。“透镜？”他说，“这与我有何关系？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_511');"><p>"I asked the same question," Maester Luwin said. "Clearly there was more to this than the seeming."
</p></origin><translate id="div_511" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当时，我也抱着相同的疑问，”鲁温师傅道，“显然这里面暗藏玄机。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_512');"><p>Under the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. "A lens is an instrument to help us see."
</p></origin><translate id="div_512" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>躲在厚重毛皮下的凯特琳颤抖着说：“透镜的用途是看清真相。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_513');"><p>"Indeed it is." He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe, each link forged from a different metal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_513" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没错。”学士摸了摸象征自己身份的项圈，那是一串用许多片不同金属打造而成的沉重项链。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_514');"><p>Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. "What is it that they would have us see more clearly?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_514" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳只觉一股恐惧从心底升起。“那究竟想让我们看清什么呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_515');"><p>"The very thing I asked myself." Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve. "I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes."
</p></origin><translate id="div_515" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这正是问题所在。”鲁温学士从衣袖里取出一封卷得密密实实的信笺。“于是我把整个木盒分解开来，在假的盒底找到真正的信。不过这封信不是给我的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_516');"><p>Ned held out his hand. "Let me have it, then."
</p></origin><translate id="div_516" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德伸出手：“那就交给我罢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_517');"><p>Luwin did not stir. "Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_517" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温学士没有反应。“老爷，很抱歉，可信也不是给您的。上面清楚写着只能让凯特琳夫人拆看。我可以把信送过去吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_518');"><p>Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed. It was sealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin bowed and began to retreat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_518" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳点点头，没有答话。鲁温把信放在她床边的矮桌上，信封乃是用一滴蓝色蜡油封笺。鲁温鞠了个躬，准备告退。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_519');"><p>"Stay," Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. "What is it? My lady, you’re shaking."
</p></origin><translate id="div_519" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“留下来。”奈德语气沉重地命令，他看看凯特琳。“夫人，怎么了？你在发抖。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_520');"><p>"I’m afraid," she admitted. She reached out and took the letter in trembling hands. The furs dropped away from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn. "It’s from Lysa." Catelyn looked at her husband. "It will not make us glad," she told him. "There is grief in this message, Ned. I can feel it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_520" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我害怕啊。”她坦承。她伸出颤抖的双手拿起信封，皮毛从她身上滑落，她完全忘记了自己赤裸的身体。只见蓝色封蜡上印有艾林家族的新月猎鹰家徽。“是莱莎写的信，”凯特琳看着她丈夫说，“只怕不会是什么好消息。”她告诉他，“奈德，这封信里蕴藏着无尽的哀伤，我感觉得出来。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_521');"><p>Ned frowned, his face darkening. "Open it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_521" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德双眉深锁，脸色转阴。“拆开。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_522');"><p>Catelyn broke the seal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_522" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳揭开封蜡。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_523');"><p>Her eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she remembered. "Lysa took no chances. When we were girls together, we had a private language, she and I."
</p></origin><translate id="div_523" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的眼神扫过内文，起初看不出所以，随后才猛然醒悟：“莱莎行事谨慎，不肯冒险。我们年幼时发明了一种秘密语言，只有我和她懂。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_524');"><p>"Can you read it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_524" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那你能否读出信上的内容？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_525');"><p>"Yes," Catelyn admitted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_525" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“能。”凯特琳表示。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_526');"><p>"Then tell us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_526" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“告诉我们。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_527');"><p>"Perhaps I should withdraw," Maester Luwin said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_527" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想我还是先告退为好。”鲁温学士道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_528');"><p>"No," Catelyn said. "We will need your counsel." She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed. The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room.
</p></origin><translate id="div_528" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，”凯特琳说，“我们需要你的意见。”她掀开毛皮，翻身下床，走到房间的另一头。午夜的冷气寒彻心肺，凄冷有如坟墓。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_529');"><p>Maester Luwin averted his eyes. Even Ned looked shocked. "What are you doing?" he asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_529" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温学士见状立刻别过头去，连奈德都被她突如其来的举动给吓祝“你要做什么？”他问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_530');"><p>"Lighting a fire," Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then knelt over the cold hearth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_530" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“生火。”凯特琳告诉他。她从衣柜里找出一件睡袍，披上之后在早已冷却的火炉前蹲了下来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_531');"><p>"Maester Luwin..." Ned began.
</p></origin><translate id="div_531" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“鲁温师傅……”奈德开口。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_532');"><p>"Maester Luwin has delivered all my children," Catelyn said. "This is no time for false modesty." She slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_532" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我每一个孩子都是鲁温师傅接生的，”凯特琳道，“现在可不是讲究虚伪礼数的时候。”说完她把信纸塞进甫燃的火中，然后将几根粗木堆在上面。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_533');"><p>Ned crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held her there, his face inches from her. "My lady, tell me! What was this message?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_533" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德走过房间，挽着她的胳膊，把她扶起。他的手紧握她不放，脸离她只有几寸。“夫人，快告诉我！信里面究竟写了些什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_534');"><p>Catelyn stiffened in his grasp. "A warning," she said softly. "If we have the wits to hear."
</p></origin><translate id="div_534" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳在他的逼问下浑身僵直。“那是封警告信，”她轻声道，“如果我们够聪明，听得进去的话。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_535');"><p>His eyes searched her face. "Go on."
</p></origin><translate id="div_535" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的眼神在她脸上搜索。“请说下去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_536');"><p>"Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered."
</p></origin><translate id="div_536" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“莱莎说琼恩•艾林乃是被人谋害。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_537');"><p>His fingers tightened on her arm. "By whom?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_537" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的手指握得更紧。“被谁谋害？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_538');"><p>"The Lannisters," she told him. "The queen."

</p></origin><translate id="div_560" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一听这名字，凯特琳立刻全身僵硬。奈德察觉到她的怒意，便抽身放开她。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_561');"><p>Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man’s needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father’s castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child’s needs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_561" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳打小就知道，贵族男子在外偷生私生子是常有的事，因此她在新婚不久，得知奈德在作战途中与农家少女生了个私生子时，丝毫不感意外。再怎么说，奈德有他男人的需求，而他征战的那一年，只和她婚后团聚数日便匆匆南下，留她安然地待在后方父亲的奔流城，两人分隔两地。那时她的心思都放在襁褓中的罗柏身上，甚少念及她几乎不认识的丈夫。他在戎马倥偬间，自然不免寻求慰藉。而一旦他留下了种，她也希望他至少能让那孩子衣食无虞。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_562');"><p>He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and called him "son" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.
</p></origin><translate id="div_562" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但他做的不只如此，史塔克家和别人不一样，奈德把他的私生子带回家来，在众人面前叫他“儿子”. 当战争终于结束，凯特琳返回临冬城时，琼恩和他的奶妈已经在城里住了下来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_563');"><p>That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband’s soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys’s Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur’s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_563" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这件事伤她很深，奈德非但不肯说出孩子的母亲，连关系情形半个字也不跟她提。然而城堡里没有不透风的墙，凯特琳很快就从她的侍女群中听说了几种揣测，这些都是从跟随她丈夫打仗的士兵嘴里传出来的。她们交头接耳说着外号“拂晓神剑”的亚瑟•戴恩爵士，说他是伊里斯麾下御林七铁卫中武艺最高强的骑士，但他们的年轻主子却在一对一的决斗中击毙了他。她们还绘声绘影地叙述事后奈德是如何地带着亚瑟爵士的佩剑，前往盛夏海岸的星坠城寻找亚瑟的妹妹。她们说亚夏拉•戴恩小姐皮肤白皙，身材高挑，一双紫罗兰色的眸子深邃而幽冷。她想了两个星期才终于鼓起勇气，某天夜里在床上向丈夫当面问起。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_564');"><p>That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. "Never ask me about Jon," he said, cold as ice. "He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady." She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne’s name was never heard in Winterfell again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_564" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而，那却是两人结婚多年以来，奈德惟一吓着她的一次。“永远不要跟我问起琼恩的事，”他的口气寒冷如冰，“他是我的亲生骨肉，你只需知道这点就够了。现在，夫人，我要知道你是打哪儿听来这名字的。”她向他保证以后不会再提起这件事，于是便把消息来源告诉了他。翌日起，城中一切谣言戛然而止，临冬城中从此再听不到亚夏拉•戴恩这个名字。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_565');"><p>Whoever Jon’s mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned’s sake, so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. "Jon must go," she said now.
</p></origin><translate id="div_565" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>无论琼恩的生母是谁，奈德对她铁定是一往情深，因为不管凯特琳说好说歹，就是没法说服他把孩子送走。这是她永远不会原谅他的一件事。她已经学着全心全意去爱自己丈夫，但她怎么也无法对琼恩产生感情。其实只要别在她眼前出现，奈德爱在外面生多少私生子她都可以睁一只眼闭一只眼。然而琼恩却总是看得见摸得着，怎么看怎么碍眼，更糟的是他越长越像奈德，竟比她生的几个儿子都还要像父亲。“琼恩非走不可。”她回答。

</p></origin><translate id="div_567" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他绝不能留下来。”凯特琳打断他，“他是你儿子，可不是我的，我不会让他留在这里。”她知道自己这样有些过分，但她也是实话实说。奈德倘若真把他留在临冬城，对那孩子本身也无好处。

</p></origin><translate id="div_568" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德看她的眼神里充满痛楚。“你也知道我不能带他南下，朝廷里根本没他容身之处。一个冠着私生子姓氏的孩子……你应该很清楚旁人会如何闲言闲语。他会被排挤。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_569');"><p>Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband’s eyes. "They say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself."
</p></origin><translate id="div_569" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳再次武装起自己，对抗丈夫眼底无声的诉求：“我听说你的好朋友劳勃在外面也生了不少私生子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_570');"><p>"And none of them has ever been seen at court!" Ned blazed. "The Lannister woman has seen to that. How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_570" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“但一个也没在宫廷里出现过！”奈德怒道，“那个兰尼斯特家的女人很坚持这一点，天杀的，凯特琳，你怎么狠得下心这样对他？他不过是个孩子罢了，他——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_571');"><p>His fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in. "Another solution presents itself," he said, his voice quiet. "Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago. It seems the boy aspires to take the black."
</p></origin><translate id="div_571" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他正在气头上，原本可能会说出更不堪入耳的话，但鲁温学士却适时插话：“我倒有个主意。您的弟弟班扬前几天来找过我，那孩子似乎对加入黑衫军颇有兴趣。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_572');"><p>Ned looked shocked. "He asked to join the Night’s Watch?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_572" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德听了大吃一惊：“他想加入守夜人？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_573');"><p>Catelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. Yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have. And in time the boy would take the oath as well. He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn’s own grandchildren for Winterfell.
</p></origin><translate id="div_573" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳没说什么，就让奈德自己理出一番头绪罢，现在她多说只会惹他生气。然而她却高兴得想亲吻眼前这位老师傅呢！他所提出的这个建议正是最完美的解决方案。班扬•史塔克是个发过誓的黑衣弟兄，对他而言，琼恩等于是此生不可能有的儿子。日子久了，那孩子自然而然也会跟着宣誓加入黑衣弟兄，这样一来，他就不能养儿育女，有朝一日来和凯特琳自己的孙子孙女抢夺临冬城的继承权了。

</p></origin><translate id="div_575" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“而且即使是私生子，在守夜人军团里也可能升到高位。”奈德思忖，但他的语气仍然有些困惑，“可琼恩年纪还这么小，倘若他是个成人，说要加入一切还好，然而他只是个十四岁的孩子……。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_576');"><p>"A hard sacrifice," Maester Luwin agreed. "Yet these are hard times, my lord. His road is no crueler than yours or your lady’s."
