</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1347');"><p>"They’ve found her, my lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1347" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德立刻起身。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1348');"><p>Ned rose quickly. "Our men or Lannister’s?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1348" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是我们的人，还是兰尼斯特家的人？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1349');"><p>"It was Jory," his steward Vayon Poole replied. "She’s not been harmed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1349" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是乔里找到的。”他的管家维扬•普尔回答，“小姐没有受伤。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1350');"><p>"Thank the gods," Ned said. His men had been searching for Arya for four days now, but the queen’s men had been out hunting as well. "Where is she? Tell Jory to bring her here at once."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1350" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谢天谢地。”奈德道。他的部下已经找了艾莉亚四天，王后的人马也同时出动。“她在哪儿？叫乔里立刻把她带来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1351');"><p>"I am sorry, my lord," Poole told him. "The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and they informed the queen when Jory brought her in. She’s being taken directly before the king?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1351" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“老爷，对不起。”普尔告诉他，“城门的守卫是兰尼斯特家的人，乔里带她进来时他们马上通报了王后，结果她被直接带到国王那里去了……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1352');"><p>"Damn that woman!" Ned said, striding to the door. "Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber. Her voice may be needed." He descended the tower steps in a red rage. He had led searches himself for the first three days, and had scarcely slept an hour since Arya had disappeared. This morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury was on him, filling him with strength.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1352" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这女人该死！”奈德大步朝门口走去。“去找珊莎，然后把她带到会客厅，到时候可能会需要她出面作证。”他火冒三丈地走下高塔楼梯。前三天他亲自率领搜寻行动，自打艾莉亚失踪，他几乎没阖过眼。到今早上，他心痛外加疲倦，连站都快站不稳了。然而现在他怒火中烧，全身充满力量。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1353');"><p>Men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard, but Ned ignored them in his haste. He would have run, but he was still the King’s Hand, and a Hand must keep his dignity. He was aware of the eyes that followed him, of the muttered voices wondering what he would do.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1353" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>穿过城堡庭院时有人出声叫他，但奈德行色匆忙，根本无暇理会。他本想迈步开跑，可再怎么说他总是御前首相，而首相多少得维持一定的尊严。他很清楚众人的眼光都集中在他身上，人们正四下窃窃私语，讨论他会作出什么举动。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1354');"><p>The castle was a modest holding a half day’s ride south of the Trident. The royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord, Ser Raymun Darry, while the hunt for Arya and the butcher’s boy was conducted on both sides of the river. They were not welcome visitors. Ser Raymun lived under the king’s peace, but his family had fought beneath Rhaegar’s dragon banners at the Trident, and his three older brothers had died there, a truth neither Robert nor Ser Raymun had forgotten. With king’s men, Darry men, Lannister men, and Stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them, tensions burned hot and heavy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1354" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这座城堡连同周围的土地都很朴素，位于三叉戟河以南，离河边只有半日骑程。先前王家车队不请自来地进驻城堡，成为城主雷蒙•戴瑞爵士的座上客，同时沿河两岸搜索艾莉亚和那屠夫小弟。他们实在称得上是不速之客。雷蒙爵士虽向国王称臣，但当年戴瑞家可是打着雷加的真龙旗臶在三叉戟河为勤王奋战的望族之一，他三位兄长通通命丧于斯，而这事不论劳勃还是雷蒙爵士都没有忘记。如今国王的队伍、戴瑞家的群众、兰尼斯特家和史塔克家的人马通通涌进狭小的城堡中，紧张的气氛可想而知。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1355');"><p>The king had appropriated Ser Raymun’s audience chamber, and that was where Ned found them. The room was crowded when he burst in. Too crowded, he thought; left alone, he and Robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1355" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王把雷蒙爵士的会客厅临时征来处理公务，奈德果然在此找到他们。他冲进房间时，里面已经挤满了人。太拥挤了，他心想，假如没这么多人，他和劳勃应该可以私下心平气和地解决此事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1356');"><p>Robert was slumped in Darry’s high seat at the far end of the room, his face closed and sullen. Cersei Lannister and her son stood beside him. The queen had her hand on Joffrey’s shoulder. Thick silken bandages still covered the boy’s arm.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1356" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃脸色凝重，整个人跨坐在长厅尽头戴瑞的高位上。瑟曦•兰尼斯特和她儿子站在他身旁。王后把一只手搭上乔佛里的肩膀。男孩的手臂仍旧扎满厚重的丝臼绷带。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1357');"><p>Arya stood in the center of the room, alone but for Jory Cassel, every eye upon her. "Arya," Ned called loudly. He went to her, his boots ringing on the stone floor. When she saw him, she cried out and began to sob.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1357" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚孤零零地站在大厅中央，只有乔里•凯索陪着她，每一只眼睛的视线都集中在她身上。“艾莉亚。”奈德大声唤道。他朝她走去，靴子在石地板上铿锵作响。她一看到他立刻大叫出声，随即抽抽噎噎地哭了起来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1358');"><p>Ned went to one knee and took her in his arms. She was shaking. "I’m sorry," she sobbed, "I’m sorry, I’m sorry."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1358" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德单膝跪下，把她搂进怀里，她浑身颤抖个不停。“对不起，”她啜泣道，“对不起，对不起！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1359');"><p>"I know," he said. She felt so tiny in his arms, nothing but a scrawny little girl. It was hard to see how she had caused so much trouble. "Are you hurt?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1359" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我知道。”他说。在他怀中的她实在好瘦小，不过是个骨瘦如柴的小女孩。很难想像她竟能闯出这么大的祸。“你有没有受伤？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1360');"><p>"No." Her face was dirty, and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks. "Hungry some. I ate some berries, but there was nothing else."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1360" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有。”她一脸污泥，眼泪在脸颊上留下了粉红色的痕迹。“只是有点饿，我吃了点野莓，但没别的东西吃。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1361');"><p>"We’ll feed you soon enough," Ned promised. He rose to face the king. "What is the meaning of this?" His eyes swept the room, searching for friendly faces. But for his own men, they were few enough. Ser Raymun Darry guarded his look well. Lord Renly wore a half smile that might mean anything, and old Ser Barristan was grave; the rest were Lannister men, and hostile. Their only good fortune was that both Jaime Lannister and Sandor Clegane were missing, leading searches north of the Trident. "Why was I not told that my daughter had been found?" Ned demanded, his voice ringing. "Why was she not brought to me at once?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1361" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们马上就给你弄吃的。”奈德向她保证，然后他起身面对国王。“你这是什么意思？”他环视大厅，寻找友善的面孔，然而除了他自己的部属以外，寥寥无几。雷蒙•戴瑞爵士面无表情，蓝礼公爵似笑非笑，谁也弄不清他究竟在想什么，老巴利斯坦则是神色沉重。余众都是兰尼斯特的人，自然个个满怀敌意。惟一算得好运的是詹姆•兰尼斯特和桑铎•克里冈此刻正率领搜索队去了三叉戟河北岸，因此都不在场。“找到我女儿为什么不通知我？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1362');"><p>He spoke to Robert, but it was Cersei Lannister who answered. "How dare you speak to your king in that manner!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1362" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他本是对劳勃说话，但瑟曦•兰尼斯特却抢先开口：“放肆！你竟敢用这种口气对国王说话！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1363');"><p>At that, the king stirred. "Quiet, woman," he snapped. He straightened in his seat. "I am sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. It seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1363" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>听到这话，国王动了动。“臭女人，你给我闭嘴。”他斥道，接着坐直身子，“奈德，不好意思，我没有吓她的意思，只是想先把她带过来，早点了结这桩事比较好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1364');"><p>"And what business is that?" Ned put ice in his voice.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1364" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你指的到底是哪桩事？”奈德的声音冷若冰霜。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1365');"><p>The queen stepped forward. "You know full well, Stark. This girl of yours attacked my son. Her and her butcher’s boy. That animal of hers tried to tear his arm off."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1365" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王后踏步向前。“史塔克，你自己很清楚。你这野丫头和那杀猪的联手攻击我的宝贝儿子，她那只野狼差点就咬断他一条胳膊。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1366');"><p>"That’s not true," Arya said loudly. "She just bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1366" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“才不是这样，”艾莉亚高声道，“她只咬了他一下，而且是因为他先欺负米凯。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1367');"><p>"Joff told us what happened," the queen said. "You and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1367" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“乔佛里已经把事情的经过都告诉我们了，”王后道，“你和那屠夫学徒一边用棍子打他，你一边放狼咬他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1368');"><p>"That’s not how it was," Arya said, close to tears again. Ned put a hand on her shoulder.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1368" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“事情不是这样的。”艾莉亚眼泪又快掉了下来，奈德连忙伸手拍拍她肩膀。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1369');"><p>"Yes it is!" Prince Joffrey insisted. "They all attacked me, and she threw Lion’s Tooth in the river!" Ned noticed that he did not so much as glance at Arya as he spoke.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1369" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“明明就是这样！”乔佛里王子坚持，“他们一起围攻我，她还把”狮牙”丢进河里！”奈德发觉他说话时正眼都不瞧艾莉亚一眼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1370');"><p>"Liar!" Arya yelled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1370" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说谎！”艾莉亚大叫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1371');"><p>"Shut up!" the prince yelled back.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1371" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“够了！”国王大吼着从椅子上站起来，声音里充满了恼怒。四周立时安静，他吹胡子瞪眼地对艾莉亚说：“孩子，你现在把事情经过告诉我，原原本本地告诉我，老老实实地讲。要知道欺骗国王可是滔天大罪。”然后他转向儿子，“等她说完自然会轮到你，在那之前，你给我把嘴闭上。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1372');"><p>"Enough!" the king roared, rising from his seat, his voice thick with irritation. Silence fell. He glowered at Arya through his thick beard. "Now, child, you will tell me what happened. Tell it all, and tell it true. It is a great crime to lie to a king." Then he looked over at his son. "When she is done, you will have your turn. Until then, hold your tongue."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1372" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当艾莉亚开始陈述事情始末时，奈德听见身后大门开启。他往后一瞄，只见维扬•普尔带着珊莎走了进来。他们静静地站在厅堂后方听艾莉亚说话。当她说到把乔佛里的剑丢进三叉戟河那段时，蓝礼•拜拉席恩忍不住哈哈大笑，国王则怒发冲冠，“巴利斯坦爵士，请护送我弟弟出去，免得他笑岔了气。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1373');"><p>As Arya began her story, Ned heard the door open behind him. He glanced back and saw Vayon Poole enter with Sansa. They stood quietly at the back of the hall as Arya spoke. When she got to the part where she threw Joffrey’s sword into the middle of the Trident, Renly Baratheon began to laugh. The king bristled. "Ser Barristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1373" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>蓝礼公爵止住笑。“哥哥真是太周到了。我自己可以找到路。”他朝乔佛里一鞠躬，“待会儿你或许可以告诉我，一个干巴巴的九岁小女生究竟是怎么用扫把棍打落你的武器，然后丢进河里的。”大门关闭之际，奈德还听见他说：“好个 ‘狮牙’。”说完又是大笑不已。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1374');"><p>Lord Renly stifled his laughter. "My brother is too kind. I can find the door myself." He bowed to Joffrey. "Perchance later you’ll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river." As the door swung shut behind him, Ned heard him say, "Lion’s Tooth," and guffaw once more.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1374" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着轮到乔佛里说他那个大相径庭的版本，他的脸色非常苍白。儿子说完之后，国王沉重地起立，那样子恨不得能及早脱身。“你叫我怎么办？他说的是一回事，而她说的却完全是另一回事。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1375');"><p>Prince Joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events. When his son was done talking, the king rose heavily from his seat, looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here. "What in all the seven hells am I supposed to make of this? He says one thing, she says another."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1375" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当时在场的不止他们两人。”奈德道，“珊莎，过来。”艾莉亚失踪的那天夜里，奈德听珊莎讲过事情经过，他知道实情为何。“告诉我们究竟是怎么回事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1376');"><p>"They were not the only ones present," Ned said. "Sansa, come here." Ned had heard her version of the story the night Arya had vanished. He knew the truth. "Tell us what happened."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1376" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他的长女犹豫不决地走向前。她穿着一件蓝色绣白边的天鹅绒洋装，脖子上挂了条银锁链，蓬松的红褐头发梳得发亮。她对妹妹眨了眨眼，接着又看看王子。“我不知道，”她噙着眼泪说，仿佛想拔腿就逃。“我不记得了，事情发生得好快，我没看见……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1377');"><p>His eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly. She was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white, a silver chain around her neck. Her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone. She blinked at her sister, then at the young prince. "I don’t know," she said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt. "I don’t remember. Everything happened so fast, I didn’t see?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1377" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你这个烂货！”艾莉亚狂叫。她像一枝利箭般朝她姐姐飞扑过去，把珊莎撞倒在地板上，使劲地拳打脚踢。“骗子，骗子，骗子，骗子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1378');"><p>"You rotten!" Arya shrieked. She flew at her sister like an arrow, knocking Sansa down to the ground, pummeling her. "Liar, liar, liar, liar."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1378" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“艾莉亚，住手！”奈德喝道。乔里把她从她姐姐身上拉开时，她双脚还兀自踢个不停。奈德扶起珊莎，她脸色苍白，浑身颤抖。“你没受伤吧？”他问。但她只是怔怔地望着艾莉亚，仿佛充耳不闻。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1379');"><p>"Arya, stop it!" Ned shouted. Jory pulled her off her sister, kicking. Sansa was pale and shaking as Ned lifted her back to her feet. "Are you hurt?" he asked, but she was staring at Arya, and she did not seem to hear.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1379" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这丫头跟她那只脏东西一个野德行。”瑟曦•兰尼斯特说，“劳勃，她非受罚不可。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1380');"><p>"The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers," Cersei Lannister said. "Robert, I want her punished."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1380" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“七层地狱啊，”劳勃咒道，“瑟曦，你看看她，她是个小孩子，你要我怎么办？打她几鞭游街示众吗？该死，不过就是小孩打架，现在没事了，也没什么严重后果。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1381');"><p>"Seven hells," Robert swore. "Cersei, look at her. She’s a child. What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It’s over. No lasting harm was done."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1381" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王后气坏了。“小乔手上一辈子都会留着疤痕。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1382');"><p>The queen was furious. "Joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1382" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃•拜拉席恩看了看他长子。“那就留着吧，或许这会给他一点教训。奈德，好好管教你女儿，我也会好好管教我儿子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1383');"><p>Robert Baratheon looked at his eldest son. "So he will. Perhaps they will teach him a lesson. Ned, see that your daughter is disciplined. I will do the same with my son."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1383" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“国王陛下，我乐意之至。”奈德如释重负。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1384');"><p>"Gladly, Your Grace," Ned said with vast relief.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1384" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃正准备走开，没想到王后还不肯罢休。“那只狼又该怎么办？”她叫住他。“那只蹂躏你儿子的禽兽该如何处置？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1385');"><p>Robert started to walk away, but the queen was not done. "And what of the direwolf?" she called after him. "What of the beast that savaged your son?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1385" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王停下脚步，转身皱眉道：“我倒是把那头该死的狼给忘了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1386');"><p>The king stopped, turned back, frowned. "I’d forgotten about the damned wolf."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1386" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德看见艾莉亚在乔里怀中绷紧身子，乔里连忙开口：“陛下，那只狼一点影子都没有。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1387');"><p>Ned could see Arya tense in Jory’s arms. Jory spoke up quickly. "We found no trace of the direwolf, Your Grace."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1387" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃看来并无不悦。“找不到？那就算了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1388');"><p>Robert did not look unhappy. "No? So be it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1388" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王后则提高音量：“把狼皮给我剥来的，赏金龙一百枚！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1389');"><p>The queen raised her voice. "A hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1389" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这毛皮还真贵，”劳勃咕哝，“臭女人，我可没兴趣。你要买就用你他妈兰尼斯特家的钱去买。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1390');"><p>"A costly pelt," Robert grumbled. "I want no part of this, woman. You can damn well buy your furs with Lannister gold."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1390" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王后冷冷地看着他，“想不到你如此吝啬。我以为我嫁的国王会赶快为我找来狼皮铺床。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1391');"><p>The queen regarded him coolly. "I had not thought you so niggardly. The king I’d thought to wed would have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1391" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃脸色一沉，怒道：“没狼还能铺得满床狼皮，你当我会变魔术？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1392');"><p>Robert’s face darkened with anger. "That would be a fine trick, without a wolf."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1392" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谁说我们没有狼？”瑟曦•兰尼斯特说。她的语气非常沉静，但那双碧眼里却闪着胜利的光芒。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1393');"><p>"We have a wolf," Cersei Lannister said. Her voice was very quiet, but her green eyes shone with triumph.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1393" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>众人过了好一阵子才明白她的意思，等大家都会意过来，国王很不高兴地耸耸肩：“随你便。叫伊林爵士去办。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1394');"><p>It took them all a moment to comprehend her words, but when they did, the king shrugged irritably. "As you will. Have Ser Ilyn see to it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1394" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃，你不是说真的吧？”奈德抗议。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1395');"><p>"Robert, you cannot mean this," Ned protested.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1395" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王已经没心情再争论下去。“别说了，奈德，这事到此为止。冰原狼本来就野性难改，假如不除掉，你女儿迟早会跟我儿子一样遭殃。帮她弄条狗，她会快乐点。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1396');"><p>The king was in no mood for more argument. "Enough, Ned, I will hear no more. A direwolf is a savage beast. Sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son. Get her a dog, she’ll be happier for it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1396" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时珊莎终于明白了国王的意思，她望向父亲，眼里满是惊惶。“他不是指淑女，是不是？”她在他脸上看到了答案。“不，”她说，“不要杀淑女。淑女不咬人的，她最乖……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1397');"><p>That was when Sansa finally seemed to comprehend. Her eyes were frightened as they went to her father. "He doesn’t mean Lady, does he?" She saw the truth on his face. "No," she said. "No, not Lady, Lady didn’t bite anybody, she’s good?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1397" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“淑女当时根本不在场，”艾莉亚生气地叫道，“你不要欺负她！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1398');"><p>"Lady wasn’t there," Arya shouted angrily. "You leave her alone!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1398" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“叫他们住手，”珊莎哀求，“叫他们住手，求求你，咬人的不是淑女，是娜梅莉亚，动手的是艾莉亚，别让他们乱来，不是淑女干的，别让他们伤害淑女，我会叫她乖乖听话，我保证，我保证……”她终于忍不住哭了起来。

</p></origin><translate id="div_1401" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德轻柔地从珊莎的搂抱里脱身而起，突然间，过去四天累积的所有疲惫又排山倒海般袭上心头。“劳勃，那你自己动手，”他的音调冷若冰霜。“敢作敢当。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1402');"><p>Ned stood, gently disengaging himself from Sansa’s grasp. All the weariness of the past four days had returned to him. "Do it yourself then, Robert," he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel. "At least have the courage to do it yourself."

</p></origin><translate id="div_1408" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>众人的目光都集中在他身上，其中珊莎的眼神最伤人。“她来自北方，死也要死得像个北方人，决不死在屠夫手里。”

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1410');"><p>He left the room with his eyes burning and his daughter’s wails echoing in his ears, and found the direwolf pup where they chained her. Ned sat beside her for a while. "Lady," he said, tasting the name. He had never paid much attention to the names the children had picked, but looking at her now, he knew that Sansa had chosen well. She was the smallest of the litter, the prettiest, the most gentle and trusting. She looked at him with bright golden eyes, and he ruffled her thick grey fur.

He reached back and shoved the burden off, and it fell with a thump in front of Ned.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1417');"><p>Bending, Ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words he would have to find for Arya, but it was not Nymeria after all. It was the butcher’s boy, Mycah, his body covered in dried blood. He had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above.
