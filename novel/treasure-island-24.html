</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1025');"><p>THE wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our hands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many trials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1025" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>风好像是特意讨好我们，现在转成了西风。我们不费吹灰之力地从岛的东北角驶到北汊的入口处。只是，因为我们没有锚索之类的东西，所以我们不敢让船停在岸滩上，必须等到潮水涨得再高些。时间真难熬。副水手长教我怎样掉转船头向风停驶，经过多次试验后终于成功地把船停下来。然后，我们静静地坐了下来，又吃了一顿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1026');"><p>"Cap'n," said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, "here's my old shipmate, O'Brien; s'pose you was to heave him overboard. I ain't partic'lar as a rule, and I don't take no blame for settling his hash, but I don't reckon him ornamental now, do you?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1026" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“船长，”他终于开腔了，脸上还是那副叫人不愉快的笑容，“地上躺着的是我的老伙计奥布赖恩；让我说你还是把它扔到船外边去吧。这没什么了不起的，我没因为让他见了阎王而感到良心上有什么过不去。我只觉得让他这么躺在船上很碍眼，你说呢？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1027');"><p>"I'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he lies, for me," said I. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1027" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我没那么大的劲，我也不愿意干这事。依我看，就让他在那儿呆着吧，我看挺好。”我答道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1028');"><p>"This here's an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim," he went on, blinking. "There's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--a sight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here O'Brien now--he's dead, ain't he? Well now, I'm no scholar, and you're a lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1028" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这条船可真不吉利——这倒霉的伊斯班袅拉号，吉姆，”他眨了眨眼睛继续说道。“这条船上已经死了好多人——自从你我离开布里斯托尔出海以来，死了多少可怜的水手！我从来未遇到过这样倒霉的事。就说这个奥布赖恩吧，他不是也送了命吗？哎，我学问不深，你是个能读会算的小家伙，直截了当地告诉我：一个人就这样完了吗？人是否还能转世？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1029');"><p>"You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must know that already," I replied. "O'Brien there is in another world, and may be watching us." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1029" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你可以杀死一个人的肉体，汉兹先生，但是却杀不死他的灵魂——你一定是早就知道了。”我答道，“奥布赖恩已经到了另一个世界，他也许正盯着我们看呢。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1030');"><p>"Ah!" says he. "Well, that's unfort'nate--appears as if killing parties was a waste of time. Howsomever, sperrits don't reckon for much, by what I've seen. I'll chance it with the sperrits, Jim. And now, you've spoke up free, and I'll take it kind if you'd step down into that there cabin and get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! I can't hit the name on 't; well, you get me a bottle of wine, Jim--this here brandy's too strong for my head." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1030" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哦！”他说。“那可真晦气——看来杀人这行当简直是浪费时间。不管怎样，照我说，鬼魂又算得了什么？我定要和他较量一番，要是有机会的话，吉姆，我俩已讲明白了，现在我想让你到船舱里给我拿——妈的！那玩意叫什么来着——你给我拿瓶葡萄酒吧。吉姆，这白兰地太烈，我的脑袋受不了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1031');"><p>Now, the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The whole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave the deck--so much was plain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes never met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look to the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien. All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty, embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1031" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>副水手长的健忘看起来不大自然；至于他想喝葡萄酒而不是白兰地，我绝不相信。他编造的这一切只不过是个借口罢了。他想让我离开甲板的意图很清楚，但他究竟目的何在我却怎么也想不出来。他总是避开我的视线，东张西望，左顾右盼；时而看看天，时而瞥一眼死去的奥布赖恩。这阵子，他始终脸上堆着笑，不时伸伸舌头做出抱歉或不好意思的样子，连小孩子也能看得出来这家伙没安什么好心。不过我爽快地答应下来，因为我知道优势在我这边。对付这个愚蠢的家伙轻而易举。我很容易做到自始至终让他看不出我有任何怀疑之心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1032');"><p>"Some wine?" I said. "Far better. Will you have white or red?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1032" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“葡萄酒？”我说，“很好。红的还是白的？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1033');"><p>"Well, I reckon it's about the blessed same to me, shipmate," he replied; "so it's strong, and plenty of it, what's the odds?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1033" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我想什么样的对我来说都无所谓，朋友，”他回答说，“只要烈一些、多一些就好，其它的都不挑了！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1034');"><p>"All right," I answered. "I'll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I'll have to dig for it." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1034" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那好，”我答道，“我去给你拿红葡萄酒来，汉兹先生。不过我还得找一阵儿。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1035');"><p>With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could, slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1035" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，我急忙从升降口跑下去，一边尽量弄出很大的响声。然后，我脱了鞋，悄悄地穿过圆木走廊，登上水手舱的梯子，把头伸出前升降口。我知道他料不到我会躲在那里，不过我还是尽可能小心谨慎。果然不出所料，我的怀疑完全得到了证实。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1036');"><p>He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1036" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他已离开原来的地方，用两手和两个膝盖爬行，很显然他爬行时一条腿疼得钻心——我能听出他想竭力压住呻吟声——然而他还是能够以很快的速度在甲板上匍匐前进。只有半分钟的工夫他已横越甲板爬到左舷的排水孔那里，从盘成一堆的绳子底下摸出一把长长的小刀，可以说是一把短剑，上面的血一直染到了刀柄上。汉兹伸出下巴审视了它一会，又用手试了试刀尖，然后急忙把它藏在上衣内侧，然后又爬回墙旁的老地方。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1037');"><p>This was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he was now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he would do afterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was, of course, more than I could say. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1037" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这正是我想要知道的。伊斯莱尔能够爬行，现在他又有了武器，既然他想尽办法支开我，很显然他想把我当成他的牺牲品。接下来他想干什么——从北汊爬过海岛回到沼泽地中的营地去呢，还是想开炮通知他的同党来救他呢？这我就很难说了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1038');"><p>Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that our interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of the schooner. We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1038" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>不过有一点我可以相信，那就是：我们在如何对付伊斯班袅拉号的问题上毫无利害冲突。我俩都希望它能停泊在一个避风的地方，到时候才可能不费多大劲，不冒多大危险地把它带回去。在做到这一步之前，我想我肯定不会有多大危险。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1039');"><p>While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been idle with my body. I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now, with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1039" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我脑海里正思量这些事的时候，身体并没闲着。我偷偷溜回船舱，穿上鞋子，随手拿起一瓶酒作为借口，重新回到甲板上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1040');"><p>Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light. He looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his favourite toast of "Here's luck!" Then he lay quiet for a little, and then, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1040" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>汉兹仍像我离开他时那样躺着，全身缩成一团，耷拉着眼皮，好像怕见光。不过我走过来时他还是抬头瞧了我一眼，熟练地砸断瓶口，照旧说一声“好运连连！”然后咕咚咕咚喝了个痛快。接着，他躺下来，取出一条烟叶，要我切下一小块。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1041');"><p>"Cut me a junk o' that," says he, "for I haven't no knife and hardly strength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missed stays! Cut me a quid, as'll likely be the last, lad, for I'm for my long home, and no mistake." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1041" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“给我切一块来，”他说，“我没带刀子；即使有也没劲。唉，吉姆哇吉姆，我这回可算是完蛋了！给我切一块，这也许是最后一口了，我不久就要回老家了，没错。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1042');"><p>"Well," said I, "I'll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and thought myself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1042" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好的，”我说，“我给你切下来一点。不过我要是你现在这个样子，自己感觉要不行了的话，我一定会跪下来做祷告，这才像个虔诚的基督徒。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1043');"><p>"Why?" said he. "Now, you tell me why." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1043" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“为什么？”他问。“告诉我，我为什么要仟悔？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1044');"><p>"Why?" I cried. "You were asking me just now about the dead. You've broken your trust; you've lived in sin and lies and blood; there's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why! For God's mercy, Mr. Hands, that's why." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1044" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“为什么？”我惊讶地喊道。“你刚才还问我人死后会怎样，你放弃了你的信仰，你犯了许多罪，躺在那，满身是血。眼前你脚边就有一个被你杀死的人，你还问为什么！求上帝饶恕你吧，汉兹先生，这才是你该做的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1045');"><p>I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He, for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1045" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我说得有些过火了，因为我想到了他怀里揣着那把沾满血迹的短剑准备结果我。他也许喝多了些，也用异常严肃的口气回答我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1046');"><p>"For thirty years," he said, "I've sailed the seas and seen good and bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out, knives going, and what not. Well, now I tell you, I never seen good come o' goodness yet. Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don't bite; them's my views--amen, so be it. And now, you look here," he added, suddenly changing his tone, "we've had about enough of this foolery. The tide's made good enough by now. You just take my orders, Cap'n Hawkins, and we'll sail slap in and be done with it." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1046" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“三十年了，”他说，“我一直航海，好的、赖的、走运的。背运的、风平浪静和大风大浪、缺粮食，拼刀子，什么没见识过。我老实对你讲，我从来就没见过好人有好报。我认为先下手为强、后下手遭殃。死人不咬活人——这就是我的看法。好了，”他忽然变了腔调，“咱们扯远了。潮水已涨得够高了，只要你听我指挥，霍金斯船长，咱们肯定会把船开进北汊的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1047');"><p>All told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was delicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in. I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1047" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我们的船只需再走两英里，但航行起来却不是一帆风顺的。北锚地的入口不仅又窄又浅，还东拐西拐的，因此大船要是没有高超的技术驾驶的话是开不进去的。我认为自己是个精明强干的驾驶员，我确信汉兹是个出色的领航员。我们绕来绕去，东躲西闪，擦过个个浅滩，船弄得平稳灵活，看着十分舒服。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1048');"><p>Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. The shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in truth it was, the estuary of a river. Right before us, at the southern end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. It had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us that the anchorage was calm. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1048" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>船刚通过两个尖角，立即就被陆地包围起来。北汊的岸上同南锚地的沿岸一样，被茂密的树林覆盖着。但这里的水域比较狭长，实际上更像河湾。在船头正前方的南端，我们看见一艘船的残骸要烂得塌下来。那是一艘很大的三桅帆船，但天长日久、风吹日晒使它全身挂满湿漉漉的海藻，甲板上已扎根有灌木，盛开着艳丽的花朵，看起来则更是一片凄凉景象。但这一切表明锚地是平静而安全的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1049');"><p>"Now," said Hands, "look there; there's a pet bit for to beach a ship in. Fine flat sand, never a cat's paw, trees all around of it, and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship." 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1049" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你看，”汉兹说，“从那里冲船上岸正合适。沙地平滑无比，一丝风也没有，周围有树，那条破船上的花开得跟花园似的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1050');"><p>"And once beached," I inquired, "how shall we get her off again?" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1050" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“但是一旦上了岸，”我问道，“我们怎么才能再把船开出去呢？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1051');"><p>"Why, so," he replied: "you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back, take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide. Come high water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet as natur'. And now, boy, you stand by. We're near the bit now, and she's too much way on her. Starboard a little--so--steady--starboard--larboard a little--steady--steady!" 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1051" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然能了，”他答道，“你在潮低时拉一条绳到那边岸上去，把绳绕在一棵大树上，再拉回来绕在绞盘上，然后躺下来等着涨潮。等水涨船高，大伙一起拉绳子，船就会左扭右扭的。注意了，孩子，准备好。咱们现在已靠近沙滩，船走得太快。向右一点——对——稳住——再向右——向右一点——稳住——照直走！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1052');"><p>So he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed, till, all of a sudden, he cried, "Now, my hearty, luff!" And I put the helm hard up, and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low, wooded shore. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1052" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他这样发号施令，我聚精会神地听着，直到他突然大叫一声，“注意，我的心肝，转舵向风！”我使劲转舵，伊斯班袅拉号来了个急转弯，直冲向长有矮树的低岸。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1053');"><p>The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain. Even then I was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows. I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head. Perhaps I had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat's; but, sure enough, when I looked round, there was Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in his right hand. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1053" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这以前，我一直绷紧每根神经注意副水手长的一举一动，但刚才那一连串的紧张动作使我只留心船触岸的事了，完全顾不得还有生命危险。我伸长脖子探出右舷墙，看船头下面翻腾的浪花。要不是忽然感到一阵不安回过头去的话，我也许来不及挣扎就完蛋了。也许是我听到了吱嘎吱嘎声，或是眼角的余光扫到他移动的影子，再不就是出于一种猫似的本能；但是，总之我相信，当我回头望去，汉兹已握着那把短剑快到我眼前了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1054');"><p>We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine was the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a charging bully's. At the same instant, he threw himself forward and I leapt sideways towards the bows. As I did so, I let go of the tiller, which sprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my life, for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1054" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当四目相遇时，我们两人想必都大叫起来。但是如果说我喊出的是恐怖的叫声，那么，他发出的则像是一头蛮牛进攻时的吼叫声。就在这一刹那，他已经扑过来，我朝船头那边闪过去。我躲开时，舵柄从我手里脱掉，立即反弹回来，我想正是这样一弹才救了我的命，舵柄击中汉兹的胸部，使他一时动弹不了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1055');"><p>Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped, with all the deck to dodge about. Just forward of the main-mast I stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the trigger. The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound; the priming was useless with sea-water. I cursed myself for my neglect. Why had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? Then I should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1055" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在他回过神来之前，我已经安全地离开了被他逼进的角落。现在我可以在整个甲板上躲闪。我在主桅前站住，从口袋里取出一支手枪。尽管他已经转过身来，再次向我直扑过来。我还是镇定地瞄准后扣动扳机。撞针已经落下，可是既没有火光，也没有响声；原来火药被海水弄潮了。我怪自己不该这样粗心大意。我为什么不事先把我仅有的武器重新装上弹药呢？倘若如此，现在也不至于落得如此狼狈下场，像只待宰的羔羊。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1056');"><p>Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled hair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury. I had no time to try my other pistol, nor indeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless. One thing I saw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity. I placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness, and waited, every nerve upon the stretch. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1056" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>汉兹虽然受伤了，但他动作之快却令我吃惊，他那斑白的头发披散在脸前，因气急败坏，脸色通红。我没有时间试试我的另一支手枪，实际上也不想试，因为我知道这是徒劳。有一点我看得很清楚：我不能在他面前一味退却，否则他很快就会把我逼到船头上去，正像刚才他几乎把我逼到船尾上去一样。一旦叫他抓住，他那把血淋淋的短剑的九或十英寸钢刃，将会是我有生以来尝到的最后一种滋味。我抱住相当粗的主桅等着，每一根神经都绷紧了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1057');"><p>Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine. It was such a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove, but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as now. Still, as I say, it was a boy's game, and I thought I could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I saw certainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any ultimate escape. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1057" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他看到我有躲闪的意图，也停了下来。有一会儿时间他假装要从这边或那边围过来抓住我。我就相应地忽而向左闪，忽而向右闪。我经常在老家黑岗湾的岩石旁做这种游戏。但是，不用说，那时心可没像现在跳得这么厉害。然而，正像我说的，这是小孩子的把戏，我想我决不会输给一个腿上受了伤的老水手。事实上，我的勇气开始高涨，甚至开始盘算猜测事情的结局；我看得出我能够周旋一段时间，但最终逃生的希望却很渺茫。

So near were we, indeed, that my head came against the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got involved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape, and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand, and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1062');"><p>My new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice going against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began slowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up. Then, with a pistol in either hand, I addressed him. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1062" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>汉兹做梦也没想到我会来这一手，他开始明白这下时局对他可不利。但是一阵犹豫过后，他竟然也拖着沉重的身体费力抓住软梯往上爬，剑衔在口里。他爬得很慢，忍着疼痛，拖着那条受伤的腿好不容易爬上来。我已经把两支手枪都重新装好了弹药，他才刚刚爬了三分之一。于是我两手执枪，开始对他喊话。

I could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my new-found security, I laughed aloud. At last, with a swallow or two, he spoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity. In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but in all else he remained unmoved. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1064" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他立即停了下来。从他面部肌肉的抽动我可以看得出他正在冥思苦想。我倚仗我处在新的安全的地方，不禁大声嘲笑他想得太慢太费劲了。他咽了几口唾液才开口，脸上还带着极度困惑的表情。为了说话，他取下衔在口里的短剑，但仍保持原来的姿势。

I'd have had you but for that there lurch, but I don't have no luck, not I; and I reckon I'll have to strike, which comes hard, you see, for a master mariner to a ship's younker like you, Jim."

Something sang like an arrow through the air; I felt a blow and then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the mast. In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--I scarce can say it was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without a conscious aim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands. They did not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water. 
</p></origin><translate id="div_1066" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>我正陶醉于他这番讨好中，得意扬扬的样子像一只飞上墙的公鸡。忽然，只见他的右手向背后一挥，不知何物在空中嗖的一声像箭一般飞过来。我感到自己挨了一刀，接着一阵剧痛，一只肩膀竟被钉在桅杆上。痛得我大吃一惊。我的两支手枪顷刻间一齐射响，接着又都从我手中掉下去。我究竟是不是有意识地扣动了扳机，我说不清楚。但我敢肯定我并未有意识地瞄准。但是，掉下去的不只是我那两支手枪，随着一声从喉咙中卡出的叫喊，副水手长松开了抓住软梯的手，一头栽进水里去了。
