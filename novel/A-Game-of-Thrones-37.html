</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3265');"><p>The Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak was made of two gigantic bronze stallions, rearing, their hooves meeting a hundred feet above the roadway to form a pointed arch.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3265" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>维斯•多斯拉克的“马门”乃是两匹巨大的青铜骏马，后足站立，前脚高跃，四蹄相会于离路面百余尺的高空，形成一个尖顶圆弧。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3266');"><p>Dany could not have said why the city needed a gate when it had no walls?.?.?.?and no buildings that she could see. Yet there it stood, immense and beautiful, the great horses framing the distant purple mountain beyond. The bronze stallions threw long shadows across the waving grasses as Khal Drogo led the khalasar under their hooves and down the godsway, his bloodriders beside him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3266" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮实在不了解，这座城既无围墙，何需城门？……犹有甚者，她举目所及居然没有半栋建筑。然而马门依旧矗立在此，硕大无比，美丽逼人，两匹大马为远方紫色山峦的风景加上了边框。卓戈卡奥领着卡拉萨从它们的马蹄下经过，沿着诸神大道继续前行，血盟卫们紧随左右，青铜骏马则在碧波荡漾的草原上洒下迤长的影子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3267');"><p>Dany followed on her silver, escorted by Ser Jorah Mormont and her brother Viserys, mounted once more. After the day in the grass when she had left him to walk back to the khalasar, the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal Rhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King. Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart the next day, and Viserys had accepted. In his stubborn ignorance, he had not even known he was being mocked; the carts were for eunuchs, cripples, women giving birth, the very young and the very old. That won him yet another name: Khal Rhaggat, the Cart King. Her brother had thought it was the khal’s way of apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him. She had begged Ser Jorah not to tell him the truth, lest he be shamed. The knight had replied that the king could well do with a bit of shame?.?.?.?yet he had done as she bid. It had taken much pleading, and all the pillow tricks Doreah had taught her, before Dany had been able to make Drogo relent and allow Viserys to rejoin them at the head of the column.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3267" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮骑着银马跟随在后，护送她的是乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士和再度上马的哥哥韦赛里斯。自那天在草原上发生事故，她让他走路回卡拉萨后，多斯拉克人便语带讥讽地给他起了个绰号叫雷马尔卡奥，意思是“酸腿国王”.次日卓戈卡奥提议让他搭乘马车，韦赛里斯答应下来。倔强又无知的他，却不知这正是对他嘲弄。因为只有太监、残废、孕妇和老弱幼孺才搭马车。为此他又得了个新译名拉迦特卡奥，意思是“马车国王”.哥哥竟还以为卡奥是因为丹妮犯了错，想藉此向他赔礼。她特别恳求乔拉爵士别告诉他真相，以免他受辱。骑士回说作国王就是要能忍受些许侮辱……但他还是听了她的话。如今丹妮可是再三哀求，又用尽多莉亚教的床上功夫，才让卓戈收回成命，允许韦赛里斯重新和他们一起走在队伍前端。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3268');"><p>"Where is the city?" she asked as they passed beneath the bronze arch. There were no buildings to be seen, no people, only the grass and the road, lined with ancient monuments from all the lands the Dothraki had sacked over the centuries.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3268" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“城区究竟在哪儿？”他们从青铜拱门下穿过时，她忍不住问。放眼望去，四下没有建筑物，没有人烟，只有草原和道路，两旁摆满了千百年来多斯拉克人由各地搜刮来的古老掠获。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3269');"><p>"Ahead," Ser Jorah answered. "Under the mountain."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3269" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“前面，”乔拉爵士回答，“就在山脚下。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3270');"><p>Beyond the horse gate, plundered gods and stolen heroes loomed to either side of them. The forgotten deities of dead cities brandished their broken thunderbolts at the sky as Dany rode her silver past their feet. Stone kings looked down on her from their thrones, their faces chipped and stained, even their names lost in the mists of time. Lithe young maidens danced on marble plinths, draped only in flowers, or poured air from shattered jars. Monsters stood in the grass beside the road; black iron dragons with jewels for eyes, roaring griffins, manticores with their barbed tails poised to strike, and other beasts she could not name. Some of the statues were so lovely they took her breath away, others so misshapen and terrible that Dany could scarcely bear to look at them. Those, Ser Jorah said, had likely come from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3270" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>过了马门，抢窃而来的各方诸神和列位英雄凛然站立道路左右。丹妮骑着小银马经过曾被衰亡城市敬拜过的、如今早被遗忘的神祉，有的还朝天挥舞手中的闪电。众多国王的石雕坐在王位上，冷冷地俯视她，他们的面容却已被风雨侵蚀，连名字也失落于时间的迷雾中。身躯苗条的少女在大理石基座上跳舞，身上仅有花朵蔽体，她们拿着碎裂的瓶罐，倒出的也只有空气。站在道路两边的青草地上的还有各种怪物：眼镶珠宝的黑铁龙，狰狞咆哮的鹰头狮身兽，举尾欲刺的人面狮身蝎尾兽，以及其他不知名的怪兽。有些雕像可爱得教她透不过气，却也有些极度畸形可怖，令她不敢再看。照乔拉爵士说，这些雕像大半来自亚夏彼方的阴影之地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3271');"><p>"So many," she said as her silver stepped slowly onward, "and from so many lands."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3271" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好多啊，”小银马一边缓步向前，她一边说，“也是从好多地方来的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3272');"><p>Viserys was less impressed. "The trash of dead cities," he sneered. He was careful to speak in the Common Tongue, which few Dothraki could understand, yet even so Dany found herself glancing back at the men of her khas, to make certain he had not been overheard. He went on blithely. "All these savages know how to do is steal the things better men have built?.?.?.?and kill." He laughed. "They do know how to kill. Otherwise I’d have no use for them at all."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3272" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>韦赛里斯可不怎么感兴趣。“全是些毁灭的城市留下来的垃圾。”他冷笑道。他这句话是特别用通用语说的，因为没几个多斯拉克人听得懂，然而丹妮还是忍不住回头看看自己卡斯的人，以确定没人听见。他倒是满不在乎地继续说下去。“这些野蛮人只懂得窃取文明人现成的建筑……还有杀人。”他笑道，“但他们也真是会杀人，否则我找他们干嘛？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3273');"><p>"They are my people now," Dany said. "You should not call them savages, brother."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3273" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们现在也是我的族人，”丹妮说，“哥哥，你就别再叫他们野蛮人了吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3274');"><p>"The dragon speaks as he likes," Viserys said?.?.?.?in the Common Tongue. He glanced over his shoulder at Aggo and Rakharo, riding behind them, and favored them with a mocking smile. "See, the savages lack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men." A moss-eaten stone monolith loomed over the road, fifty feet tall. Viserys gazed at it with boredom in his eyes. "How long must we linger amidst these ruins before Drogo gives me my army? I grow tired of waiting."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3274" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真龙传人爱说什么就说什么。”韦赛里斯道……依然是用通用语。他回头瞄了一眼骑在后面的阿戈和拉卡洛，给了他们一个嘲弄的微笑。“你瞧，这些野蛮人没脑袋，听不懂文明人的话。”路边矗立着一座爬满青苔的巨石柱，足足有五十英尺高。韦赛里斯百无聊赖地看着石柱，“我们到底还要在这些废墟里待多久，卓戈才会给我军队？我等得不耐烦了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3275');"><p>"The princess must be presented to the dosh khaleen?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3275" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“公主殿下必须先晋见多希卡林……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3276');"><p>"The crones, yes," her brother interrupted, "and there’s to be some mummer’s show of a prophecy for the whelp in her belly, you told me. What is that to me? I’m tired of eating horsemeat and I’m sick of the stink of these savages." He sniffed at the wide, floppy sleeve of his tunic, where it was his custom to keep a sachet. It could not have helped much. The tunic was filthy. All the silk and heavy wools that Viserys had worn out of Pentos were stained by hard travel and rotted from sweat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3276" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“见几个老太婆，我知道。”哥哥插话，“照你所说，之后还要演场闹剧，预言她肚里的小东西。这与我何干？我受够了天天吃马肉，还有这些野蛮人的臭味。”他朝自己宽大的衣袖闻了闻，他习惯在袖子里缝个香袋，但作用非常有限，因为外衣本身就又脏又臭。韦赛里斯当初从潘托斯穿出来的丝绸羊毛，早已在长途跋舒中沾满泥渍，并因汗水而腐烂了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3277');"><p>Ser Jorah Mormont said, "The Western Market will have food more to your taste, Your Grace. The traders from the Free Cities come there to sell their wares. The khal will honor his promise in his own time."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3277" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉•莫尔蒙爵士道：“陛下，城西市集里的东西应该合您胃口。自由贸易城邦的生意人在那里做买卖，甚至会有七国的商贩来此。至于卡奥，相信他会挑适当的时机履行承诺。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3278');"><p>"He had better," Viserys said grimly. "I was promised a crown, and I mean to have it. The dragon is not mocked." Spying an obscene likeness of a woman with six breasts and a ferret’s head, he rode off to inspect it more closely.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3278" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他最好动作快点。”韦赛里斯冷冷地说，“他答应给我一顶王冠，我可是打定主意非拿到手不可，谁也别想拿真龙寻开心。”这时他瞥见一尊形似女人，有着六个乳房和一个貂头的猥亵雕像，便骑马过去看个仔细。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3279');"><p>Dany was relieved, yet no less anxious. "I pray that my sun-and-stars will not keep him waiting too long," she told Ser Jorah when her brother was out of earshot.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3279" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丹妮松了口气，却依旧不安。“我衷心期望我的日和星不会让他久等。”哥哥离开听力范围后，她这么告诉乔拉爵士。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3280');"><p>The knight looked after Viserys doubtfully. "Your brother should have bided his time in Pentos. There is no place for him in a khalasar. Illyrio tried to warn him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3280" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>骑士怀疑地望着韦赛里斯的背影。“您哥哥应该留在潘托斯等待时机。卡拉萨里不适合他待，伊利里欧也告诫过他。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3281');"><p>"He will go as soon as he has his ten thousand. My lord husband promised a golden crown."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3281" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一旦得到那一万精兵，他就会离开。我夫君承诺要给他一顶黄金王冠。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3282');"><p>Ser Jorah grunted. "Yes, Khaleesi, but?.?.?.?the Dothraki look on these things differently than we do in the west. I have told him as much, as Illyrio told him, but your brother does not listen. The horselords are no traders. Viserys thinks he sold you, and now he wants his price. Yet Khal Drogo would say he had you as a gift. He will give Viserys a gift in return, yes?.?.?.?in his own time. You do not demand a gift, not of a khal. You do not demand anything of a khal."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3282" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士咕哝道：“卡丽熙，我知道，可是……多斯拉克人的行事作风与我们西方人不同。我跟他说过几次，伊利里欧也谈过，但您哥哥不听。马王并非生意人，韦赛里斯认为他把您卖了，现在想要收账，然而卓戈卡奥将您视为他的礼物，他会以礼回赠韦赛里斯……只不过什么时候送取决于他。您不能主动开口问他要礼物，对卡奥不能这样。开口跟卡奥要任何东西都是行不通的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3283');"><p>"It is not right to make him wait." Dany did not know why she was defending her brother, yet she was. "Viserys says he could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3283" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可叫他这样干等却也不对。”丹妮不知自己为何要为哥哥辩护，总之她开了口。“韦赛里斯说有了一万名多斯拉克哮吼武士，他可以横扫七国全境。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3284');"><p>Ser Jorah snorted. "Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3284" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士哼了一声。“给韦赛里斯一万把扫把，他也没法把一座马厩打扫干净。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3285');"><p>Dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in his tone. "What?.?.?.?what if it were not Viserys?" she asked. "If it were someone else who led them? Someone stronger? Could the Dothraki truly conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3285" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>对他的轻蔑口吻，丹妮实在是不能佯作吃惊。“那……那如果不是韦赛里斯呢？”她问，“如果换个人？换个更强的人领军呢？多斯拉克人果真能征服七国吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3286');"><p>Ser Jorah’s face grew thoughtful as their horses trod together down the godsway. "When I first went into exile, I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked barbarians, as wild as their horses. If you had asked me then, Princess, I should have told you that a thousand good knights would have no trouble putting to flight a hundred times as many Dothraki."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3286" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们继续沿着诸神大道走下去，乔拉爵士则陷入沉思。“当初刚遭放逐，我也是把多斯拉克人视为衣不蔽体、跟他们的马同样野性难驯的化外蛮子。公主殿下，若那时候您问起我这个问题，我会毫不犹豫地告诉您只需一千名训练有素的骑士，便足以使上百倍的多斯拉克人抱头鼠窜。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3287');"><p>"But if I asked you now?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3287" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“现在呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3288');"><p>"Now," the knight said, "I am less certain. They are better riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and their bows outrange ours. In the Seven Kingdoms, most archers fight on foot, from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes. The Dothraki fire from horseback, charging or retreating, it makes no matter, they are full as deadly?.?.?.?and there are so many of them, my lady. Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3288" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“现在的话，”骑士道，“我就不敢确定。他们的马术胜过任何骑士，天不怕地不怕，弓箭的舐程也远超过我们。七国的弓箭手多半徒步，躲在盾牌围成的墙壁或是削尖的木桩做成的工事后面。多斯拉克人却是骑马舐箭，无论冲锋撤退都行动自如。公主殿下，他们非常危险……而他们的数量也同样惊人。您夫君大人的卡拉萨足足拥有四万骑马战士。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3289');"><p>"Is that truly so many?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3289" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“四万人真的很多？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3290');"><p>"Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident," Ser Jorah admitted, "but of that number, no more than a tenth were knights. The rest were archers, freeriders, and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes. When Rhaegar fell, many threw down their weapons and fled the field. How long do you imagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood? How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3290" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当年您哥哥雷加，便是带着这么多人到三叉戟河作战，”乔拉爵士说，“但其中只有不到十分之一是骑士，其余都是流浪骑手、弓箭手，以及拿枪矛的步兵。雷加一死，很多人便丢下武器，逃离战场。面对四万名嗜血哮吼武士的决死冲锋，你觉得这样的乌合之众能支撑多久？置身箭如雨下的杀戮战场，身穿硬皮革和锁子甲，又能有多大效用？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3291');"><p>"Not long," she said, "not well."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3291" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“撑不久，”她说，“也没什么用。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3292');"><p>He nodded. "Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose, it will never come to that. The riders have no taste for siegecraft. I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3292" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他点点头。“可是公主殿下，容我提醒您，只要诸神赐予七国的领主一点点脑子，他们就不至于沦落到那种地步。草原的骑马战士对围城完全不在行，能不能攻下七国里最弱的城堡，我都很怀疑。但若是劳勃•拜拉席恩愚蠢到跟他们正面决战……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3293');"><p>"Is he?" Dany asked. "A fool, I mean?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_3293" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他是这样的人吗？”丹妮问：“我的意思是，他愚蠢吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3294');"><p>Ser Jorah considered that for a moment. "Robert should have been born Dothraki," he said at last. "Your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand. The Usurper would agree. He is a strong man, brave?.?.?.?and rash enough to meet a Dothraki horde in the open field. But the men around him, well, their pipers play a different tune. His brother Stannis, Lord Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark?.?.?.?" He spat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3294" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔拉爵士沉吟片刻。“劳勃应该生为多斯拉克人才对。”最后他开口说，“您的卡奥会告诉您，只有懦夫才会躲在城墙后，不敢与敌人当面对决，对这种说法，’篡夺者‘绝对会拍手赞成。他这个人骁勇善战……照他的个性，的确会冲动地在开阔地和多斯拉克大军决一死战。但他身边有很多人，哈，这些人就像伴奏的笛手，而他们决不会如此行事，比如他弟弟史坦尼斯•泰温兰尼斯特公爵，艾德•史塔克……”他啐了口唾沫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3295');"><p>"You hate this Lord Stark," Dany said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3295" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你好像很讨厌这个史塔克公爵。”丹妮道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3296');"><p>"He took from me all I loved, for the sake of a few lice-ridden poachers and his precious honor," Ser Jorah said bitterly. From his tone, she could tell the loss still pained him. He changed the subject quickly. "There," he announced, pointing. "Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3296" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他夺走了我深爱的一切，只为了区区几个偷猎人渣和他宝贵的荣誉。”乔拉爵士苦涩地说。从他的口气，丹妮听得出回忆依旧折磨着他。但他随即转变话题。“您看，”他指给她瞧，“这就是维斯多斯拉克，马王之城。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3297');"><p>Khal Drogo and his bloodriders led them through the great bazaar of the Western Market, down the broad ways beyond. Dany followed close on her silver, staring at the strangeness about her. Vaes Dothrak was at once the largest city and the smallest that she had ever known. She thought it must be ten times as large as Pentos, a vastness without walls or limits, its broad windswept streets paved in grass and mud and carpeted with wildflowers. In the Free Cities of the west, towers and manses and hovels and bridges and shops and halls all crowded in on one another, but Vaes Dothrak sprawled languorously, baking in the warm sun, ancient, arrogant, and empty.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3297" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卓戈卡奥和他的血盟卫领着大队人马穿过络绎熙攘的城西市集，沿着宽阔的大道行进。丹妮骑着银马，紧随在旁，睁大眼睛看着周遭的奇异风光。维斯多斯拉克既是她生平所见最大的城市，却也称得上最小的一座。依她判断，这座城占地面积大概有十个潘托斯那么大，既无城墙亦无边际，饱经风沙吹拂的宽广街道上铺着青草和泥土，野花则如地毯般覆盖其上。在西方的自由贸易城邦，塔楼、豪宅、房舍、桥梁、店铺和厅堂统统拥挤一块，而维斯多斯拉克却是慵懒地延展四方，沐浴在暖阳下，显得古老、傲慢而空虚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3298');"><p>Even the buildings were so queer to her eyes. She saw carved stone pavilions, manses of woven grass as large as castles, rickety wooden towers, stepped pyramids faced with marble, log halls open to the sky. In place of walls, some palaces were surrounded by thorny hedges. "None of them are alike," she said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3298" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就连各种建筑，在她眼里也显得古怪。她看到雕满花纹的石头营帐，如城堡般大的草织宅邸，摇摇欲坠的木造楼塔，大理石砌的阶状金字塔，以及屋顶开敞、直面天际的木材殿堂。有些宫殿更以荆棘篱笆来取代围墙。“它们长得通通都不一样。”她说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3299');"><p>"Your brother had part of the truth," Ser Jorah admitted. "The Dothraki do not build. A thousand years ago, to make a house, they would dig a hole in the earth and cover it with a woven grass roof. The buildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands they’ve plundered, and they built each after the fashion of their own peoples."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3299" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您哥哥说得倒也没错，”乔拉爵士坦承，“多斯拉克人的确不事建筑。一千年前，他们所谓的盖房子，便是在地上挖个大坑，然后铺上草织屋顶。您在这里看到的建筑，都是他们从别处掳来的奴隶盖的。不用说，那些奴隶自然是依照各地的风土民情去修筑了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3300');"><p>Most of the halls, even the largest, seemed deserted. "Where are the people who live here?" Dany asked. The bazaar had been full of running children and men shouting, but elsewhere she had seen only a few eunuchs going about their business.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3300" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>厅堂看起来大都荒废已久，即便最大的那几间也不例外。“住在这里的人都到哪儿去了？”丹妮问。市集里到处都是跑来跑去的小孩和高声吆喝的成年人，但在这里，她只看到几个办事的太监。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3301');"><p>"Only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city, them and their slaves and servants," Ser Jorah replied, "yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house every man of every khalasar, should all the khals return to the Mother at once. The crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass, and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children."
</p></origin><translate id="div_3301" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“定居在圣城的，只有多希卡林的老妇，以及侍候她们的奴隶和仆人。”乔拉爵士回答，“然而维斯•多斯拉克占地广大，就算所有的卡奥都带着他们的卡拉萨回归圣母山，这里也容纳得下。女祭司曾经预言这样的一天终将来临，所以维斯•多斯拉克必须做好迎接所有孩子的准备。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3302');"><p>Khal Drogo finally called a halt near the Eastern Market where the caravans from Yi Ti and Asshai and the Shadow Lands came to trade, with the Mother of Mountains looming overhead. Dany smiled as she recalled Magister Illyrio’s slave girl and her talk of a palace with two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver. The "palace" was a cavernous wooden feasting hall, its rough-hewn timbered walls rising forty feet, its roof sewn silk, a vast billowing tent that could be raised to keep out the rare rains, or lowered to admit the endless sky. Around the hall were broad grassy horse yards fenced with high hedges, firepits, and hundreds of round earthen houses that bulged from the ground like miniature hills, covered with grass.

As each rider swung down from his saddle, he unbelted his arakh and handed it to a waiting slave, and any other weapons he carried as well. Even Khal Drogo himself was not exempt. Ser Jorah had explained that it was forbidden to carry a blade in Vaes Dothrak, or to shed a free man’s blood. Even warring khalasars put aside their feuds and shared meat and mead together when they were in sight of the Mother of Mountains. In this place, the crones of the dosh khaleen had decreed, all Dothraki were one blood, one khalasar, one herd.

At first Dany had thought of them as a kind of Dothraki Kingsguard, sworn to protect their lord, but it went further than that. Jhiqui had taught her that a bloodrider was more than a guard; they were the khal’s brothers, his shadows, his fiercest friends. "Blood of my blood," Drogo called them, and so it was; they shared a single life. The ancient traditions of the horselords demanded that when the khal died, his bloodriders died with him, to ride at his side in the night lands. If the khal died at the hands of some enemy, they lived only long enough to avenge him, and then followed him joyfully into the grave. In some khalasars, Jhiqui said, the bloodriders shared the khal’s wine, his tent, and even his wives, though never his horses. A man’s mount was his own.
