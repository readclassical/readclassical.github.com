</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1042');"><p>The north went on forever.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1042" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>北境漫漫，一望无涯。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1043');"><p>Tyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1043" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂•兰尼斯特虽然熟读地图，但经过两周以来的一径北行，他深切体会到地图上说的是一回事，实际上却另有蹓跷。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1044');"><p>They had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the royal departure, riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queen’s huge wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about them. The kingsroad was just beyond the sprawl of castle and town. There the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south, taking the tumult with them, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his nephew.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1044" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们和国王的队伍于同一天离开临冬城，冒着细雪，穿过那一片人声马嘶、马车嘎吱和王后轮宫的呻吟。国王大道紧邻着主堡和城下市镇。国王的旗臶与车队，骑士和自由骑手就在该处转向南行，提利昂则与班扬•史塔克和琼恩叔侄二人往北走。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1045');"><p>It had grown colder after that, and far more quiet.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1045" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在那之后，天气越趋凄冷，四周更显沉寂。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1046');"><p>West of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony summits. To the east the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see. Stone bridges spanned swift, narrow rivers, while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone. The road was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1046" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王大道逐渐变成一条比森林小路大不了多少的小径。道路西边是崎岖的灰岩丘陵，矮丘顶高耸着一座座守望台。东边则地势低缓，平坦旷野无限伸展，直至极目尽头。石桥跨越汹涌的狭窄激流，农场围绕石墙木梁的聚落。路上来往颇为频繁，日落后极易找到歇脚旅店。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1047');"><p>Three days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense wood, and the kingsroad grew lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders. When the wind blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1047" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而好景不长，离开临冬城三日之后，农田退去，只见茂密深林，国王大道也越来越人迹罕至。丘陵则日益陡峭，到了第五天，已经成了山脉，宛如肩负陈雪和陡峭岩峰的灰蓝巨人。当北风吹起，长长的冰针像旗臶一般从高耸的峰峦间飞溅而下。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1048');"><p>With the mountains a wall to the west, the road veered north by northeast through the wood, a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any Tyrion had ever seen. "The wolfswood," Benjen Stark called it, and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs, and some not so distant. Jon Snow’s albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling, but never raised his own voice in reply. There was something very unsettling about that animal, Tyrion thought.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1048" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山在西方，路往东北，蜿蜒穿过树林。班扬•史塔克称这座满是橡树、常青树和黑荆棘，看起来比提利昂所见过任何林子都要古老的森林为“狼林”，每到夜晚，森林里也确实传来远方狼群此起彼落的嚎叫，有时离他们还不甚远。雪诺的白子冰原狼听到便会竖起耳朵，却从不应和。提利昂总觉得那只东西有种令人极端不安的感觉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1049');"><p>There were eight in the party by then, not counting the wolf. Tyrion traveled with two of his own men, as befit a Lannister. Benjen Stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the Night’s Watch, but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast, and there joined up with another of the black brothers, one Yoren. Yoren was stooped and sinister, his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing, but he seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone. With him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the Fingers. "Rapers," Yoren said with a cold look at his charges. Tyrion understood. Life on the Wall was said to be hard, but no doubt it was preferable to castration.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1049" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>扣除小狼不算，他们一行八人。首先提利昂依照兰尼斯特家的排场，带了两个随从。班扬•史塔克则只带着他的私生子侄儿，还有守夜人部队的一些牲口。但当他们在狼林边缘一栋木造庄园过夜时，又有一位叫尤伦的黑衣弟兄加入他们。这个尤伦驼着背，模样颇为阴狠，五官都躲在他那跟臸服一般黑的胡子后面，但不难看出他是条汉子。他带了两个来自五指半岛，衣着破烂的农家子弟。“强奸犯。”尤伦冷冷地看着他们说。提利昂顿时领悟，长城上的日子虽然艰苦，但总比阉刑好得多。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1050');"><p>Five men, three boys, a direwolf, twenty horses, and a cage of ravens given over to Benjen Stark by Maester Luwin. No doubt they made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad, or any road.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1050" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>五个男人，三个孩子，一只冰原狼，二十匹马，还有一笼鲁温学士托班扬•史塔克捎带的大乌鸦，这样的一支队伍，想必是幅相当怪异的景象。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1051');"><p>Tyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and his sullen companions, with an odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay. Yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell, his hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice, his clothing old, patched, and seldom washed. His two young recruits smelled even worse, and seemed as stupid as they were cruel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1051" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂注意到琼恩•雪诺一路不住打量尤伦和他那两名阴郁伙伴，脸上挂着古怪的表情，似乎有些困恼。尤伦不仅驼背，而且浑身酸臭，须发油腻，虱蚤丛生又衣衫破烂，辫布补丁且甚少清洗。他的两名手下味道更难闻，人则既愚蠢又残忍。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1052');"><p>No doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the Night’s Watch was made up of men like his uncle. If so, Yoren and his companions were a rude awakening. Tyrion felt sorry for the boy. He had chosen a hard life?.?.?.?or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1052" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>看来那孩子误以为守夜人军团里全是他叔叔这种人了。倘若他真这么想，那么尤伦一帮人对他可算是个错愕的觉醒。提利昂为那孩子难过，他选择的是一条艰难的道路……或者应该说，别人为他选择了这条艰难的道路。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1053');"><p>He had rather less sympathy for the uncle. Benjen Stark seemed to share his brother’s distaste for Lannisters, and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told him of his intentions. "I warn you, Lannister, you’ll find no inns at the Wall," he had said, looking down on him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1053" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他对孩子的叔叔可没这般好感。班扬•史塔克似乎和他哥哥一样讨厌兰尼斯特家的人，先前当提利昂表示想要同行时，他的反应相当不悦：“兰尼斯特，我话说在前头，长城没旅馆可住的。”他高高在上地盯着他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1054');"><p>"No doubt you’ll find some place to put me," Tyrion had replied. "As you might have noticed, I’m small."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1054" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你总有办法安顿我罢，”提利昂答道，“你也看到了，我个子很小。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1055');"><p>One did not say no to the queen’s brother, of course, so that had settled the matter, but Stark had not been happy. "You will not like the ride, I promise you that," he’d said curtly, and since the moment they set out, he had done all he could to live up to that promise.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1055" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当然，没人敢对王后的弟弟说不，所以事情就算这么定了，但班扬依旧很不高兴。“我保证你不会喜欢这趟旅程。”他很不客气地回敬，而自队伍出发以来，他也果真尽其所能让此话成真。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1056');"><p>By the end of the first week, Tyrion’s thighs were raw from hard riding, his legs were cramping badly, and he was chilled to the bone. He did not complain. He was damned if he would give Benjen Stark that satisfaction.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1056" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>---缺失---
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1057');"><p>He took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old and musty-smelling. Stark had offered it to him in an excess of Night’s Watch gallantry, no doubt expecting him to graciously decline. Tyrion had accepted with a smile. He had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of Winterfell, and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. It was cold up here, and growing colder. The nights were well below freezing now, and when the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens. By now Stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse. Perhaps he had learned a lesson. The Lannisters never declined, graciously or otherwise. The Lannisters took what was offered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1057" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂倒是在御寒皮衣上扳回一城，原本史塔克故作殷勤地献上一件满溢腥羶，老旧破烂的熊皮，以表现守夜人的济弱扶贫，显然希望他会碍于礼数婉拒，但提利昂微笑着收下。离开临冬城的时候，他带上了所有最暖和的衣服，随即却发现根本不够。这里真是冷得吓人，而且气温还在不断下降。夜里的温度早已降至冰点以下，每当朔风吹起，便如尖刀般割进他最暖和的羊皮衣。想必史塔克此时正为自己一时兴起的骑士精神后悔吧。也许他会从中学到教训：兰尼斯特家人来者不拒，管他什么礼数，只要别人给，我就敢拿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1058');"><p>Farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under, and they were thrown back on their own resources.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1058" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>越往北行，愈加深入狼林的幽暗国度，农庄田舍便更见疏落，终至人迹绝响，骤然遗世独立。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1059');"><p>Tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one. Too small, too hobbled, too in-the-way. So while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected rude shelters, tended the horses, and built a fire, it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1059" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>无论扎营拔营，提利昂都帮不上忙。他个子太小，蹒跚跛行只会碍手碍脚。于是他便趁史塔克和尤伦等人搭建帐篷居所，照料马匹，生火取暖之际，裹紧皮衣，揣着酒袋，蹒跚到一边独自读书，这成了他的习惯。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1060');"><p>On the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber from the Summer Isles that he had brought all the way north from Casterly Rock, and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons. With Lord Eddard Stark’s permission, Tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the Winterfell library and packed them for the ride north.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1060" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>旅行的第十八天，他带着从凯岩城一路携来北方，盛夏群岛酿产的珍贵琥珀甜酒，以及相关龙族佚闻事迹的书——这几册珍贵的典籍乃是提利昂求得艾德•史塔克公爵允许，从临冬城的图书馆拿的——独自走开。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1061');"><p>He found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-running stream with waters clear and cold as ice. A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind. Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a sip of the wine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is black because of its high iron content, the book told him. It is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly impervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder. An archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1061" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他走到营地的喧嚣之外，激流奔涌、水冷如冰的溪边觅得一方宁静。一株形体怪诞的老橡树恰好为他遮挡寒风。提利昂背靠树干，扯紧皮毛，啜了一口酒后读起关于龙骨的叙述。龙骨含铁量高，故呈黑色，书上如是说，龙骨坚硬如铁，然材臼极轻且有韧性，自然亦不怕火。无怪乎多斯拉克人视龙骨弓为稀世珍宝，配上龙骨弓，舐手可以轻易超越木臸弓箭的舐程。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1062');"><p>Tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. When he had first come to King’s Landing for his sister’s wedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of Targaryen’s throne room. King Robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but Tyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1062" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂对龙有种病态的迷恋。当年他初次造访君临，参加姐姐和劳勃•拜拉席恩的婚礼时，就打定主意一定要瞧瞧那些悬挂在坦格利安王座厅墙上的龙头。虽然劳勃国王早已把龙头换成了旗臶和壁毡，提利昂仍不死心，最后总算在阴湿的地窖内找到了它们的收藏处所。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1063');"><p>He had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. He had not thought to find them beautiful. Yet they were. As black as onyx, polished smooth, so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch. They liked the fire, he sensed. He’d thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him. The teeth were long, curving knives of black diamond. The flame of the torch was nothing to them; they had bathed in the heat of far greater fires. When he had moved away, Tyrion could have sworn that the beast’s empty eye sockets had watched him go.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1063" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他本以为龙头必定令人叹为观止，甚至叫人望而生畏，却怎么也想不到它们竟会是如此美丽的东西。它们的的确确美得让人目瞪口呆。黑如玛瑙，光滑洁亮，在他的火把映照下仿佛会闪闪发光。他察觉到它们喜欢火，因而特地把火把插进其中一个较大的龙嘴里，果真火光大盛，影子在他身后的墙上大肆舞跃。龙牙宛如一柄柄黑钻石臸成的长弯刀，长年浸涤于炽热的烈焰里，火把微焰对它们来说根本算不了什么。当他抽身离去时，他发誓那头巨兽空洞的眼窝是目送着自己离开的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1064');"><p>There were nineteen skulls. The oldest was more than three thousand years old; the youngest a mere century and a half. The most recent were also the smallest; a matched pair no bigger than mastiff’s skulls, and oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. They were the last of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1064" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>巨龙头骨一共十九个，最老的寿命已经超过三千年，最幼小的也有一个半世纪那么久。幼龙的头骨也是最小的，那两个畸形怪状，比猎犬的头骨大不了多少，它们是龙石岛上所孵化的最后两只龙，是坦格利安家族最后的两只，或许也是这世界上最后的两只，它们非常短命。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1065');"><p>From there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story, the dragons that Aegon Targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the Seven Kingdoms of old. The singers had given them the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless and awed. You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar’s gullet, although you would not have ridden it out again. Meraxes was even bigger. And the greatest of them, Balerion, the Black Dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1065" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>其他的龙头则一个比一个大，最大的三头便是歌谣和传说里最恐怖的巨兽，即伊耿•坦格利安和他的妹妹们攻打古代七国时所骑乘的那三头龙。吟游诗人为他们都取了神的名字：贝勒里恩、米拉西斯和瓦格哈尔。提利昂站在他们的血盆大口间，震舑得说不出话来。瓦格哈尔的咽喉之大，大到你可以骑马进去，当然别想活着出来。米拉西斯体型更加惊人。而最硕大无朋，人称
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1066');"><p>Tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time, staring at Balerion’s huge, empty-eyed skull until his torch burned low, trying to grasp the size of the living animal, to imagine how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and swept across the skies, breathing fire.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1066" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“黑死神”的贝勒里恩，则可一口吞下整只野牛，或是传说中漫游于伊班港以北冰冷荒原上的长毛象。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1067');"><p>His own remote ancestor, King Loren of the Rock, had tried to stand against the fire when he joined with King Mern of the Reach to oppose the Targaryen conquest. That was close on three hundred years ago, when the Seven Kingdoms were kingdoms, and not mere provinces of a greater realm. Between them, the Two Kings had six hundred banners flying, five thousand mounted knights, and ten times as many freeriders and men-at-arms. Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number, the chroniclers said, and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain, their loyalties uncertain.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1067" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂在阴湿地窖里伫立良久，盯着贝勒里恩空洞而巨大的眼窝，试着想像眼前这只巨兽生前的模样，想像它开展双翼，横扫天际，口吐烈焰的景象，直到火把燃荆他的远祖凯岩王罗伦，曾与河湾王孟恩联军抵抗坦格利安的征服。那是约三百年前的事，当时七大王国真的是各自为政的王国，而非今日大一统国度下的属地。两军合计有六百诸侯，五千骑兵，以及五万以上的雇佣军和步兵。据史家记载，“龙王”伊耿的军力大概只有对手的五分之一，其中多半是从他之前击败的敌手军队中召募而来，忠诚堪忧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1068');"><p>The hosts met on the broad plains of the Reach, amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest. When the Two Kings charged, the Targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run. For a few moments, the chroniclers wrote, the conquest was at an end?.?.?.?but only for those few moments, before Aegon Targaryen and his sisters joined the battle.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1068" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两军在河湾沿岸的沃野平畴中相遇，在辫地结实累累、等待收获的金黄麦田上交战。联军发动冲锋，坦格利安军立时四散溃逃。短短几分钟内，史家又如此写道，连年的征服似乎就要划上休止符……但这只是伊耿•坦格利安和他两个妹妹投入战局之前的那几分钟。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1069');"><p>It was the only time that Vhaghar, Meraxes, and Balerion were all unleashed at once. The singers called it the Field of Fire.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1069" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这是历史上惟一一次瓦格哈尔、米拉西斯和贝勒里恩同时出击，后世的吟游诗人称之为“怒火燎原”. 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1070');"><p>Near four thousand men had burned that day, among them King Mern of the Reach. King Loren had escaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge his fealty to the Targaryens, and beget a son, for which Tyrion was duly grateful.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1070" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那天共有将近四千名士兵被烧成灰烬，其中包括河湾王孟恩。罗伦王侥幸逃脱，没过多久便向坦格利安家族投降称臣，后来还产下一子，为此提利昂只有感激的份。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1071');"><p>"Why do you read so much?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1071" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你读那么多书干嘛？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1072');"><p>Tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a few feet away, regarding him curiously. He closed the book on a finger and said, "Look at me and tell me what you see."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1072" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂闻言抬头，琼恩•雪诺正站在几步以外，好奇地端详他。他用一根手指夹住正读的书页：“看着我，然后告诉我你看到了什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1073');"><p>The boy looked at him suspiciously. "Is this some kind of trick? I see you. Tyrion Lannister."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1073" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>男孩狐疑地看着他说：“你耍什么把戏？我看到你啊，提利昂•兰尼斯特。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1074');"><p>Tyrion sighed. "You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see is a dwarf. You are what, twelve?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1074" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂叹道：“雪诺啊，你是个私生子，却真是够客气。你看到的是个侏儒。你几岁了？十二？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1075');"><p>"Fourteen," the boy said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1075" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“十四。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1076');"><p>"Fourteen, and you’re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, and I walk with difficulty. I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be interested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman. Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slaver’s grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are all the poorer. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years. My brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him. I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldn’t you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. My mind is my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mind?.?.?.?and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge." Tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book. "That’s why I read so much, Jon Snow."

Whoever his mother had been, she had left little of herself in her son. "What are you reading about?" he asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1077" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>男孩静静地听完这番话。他虽然名分上没有史塔克这个姓，却有张地地道道史塔克家人的脸：脸长，严肃拘谨，喜怒不形于色。不论他母亲是谁，想必在他身上没留下多少自己的特征。 “那你在读什么？”他问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1078');"><p>"Dragons," Tyrion told him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1078" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“跟龙有关的东西。”提利昂告诉他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1079');"><p>"What good is that? There are no more dragons," the boy said with the easy certainty of youth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1079" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“读这有什么用？世上已经没有龙了。”男孩语气里带着少年独有的确信。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1080');"><p>"So they say," Tyrion replied. "Sad, isn’t it? When I was your age, used to dream of having a dragon of my own."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1080" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“人们是这样说没错，”提利昂答道，“很可惜，不是吗？我在你这年纪的时候，还经常梦想哪天有自己的龙哪。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1081');"><p>"You did?" the boy said suspiciously. Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1081" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真的吗？”男孩难以置信地说。或许他认为提利昂在寻他开心罢。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1082');"><p>"Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he’s seated on a dragon’s back." Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet. "I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire. Sometimes I’d imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister." Jon Snow was staring at him, a look equal parts horror and fascination. Tyrion guffawed. "Don’t look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. You’ve dreamt the same kind of dreams."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1082" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然是真的了，只要能骑在龙背上，即便是发育不良，畸形扭曲的丑陋小男孩也可以睥睨全世界。”提利昂推开熊皮，站起身来。“以前我常躲在凯岩城深处的地道，燃起火堆，望着熊熊烈焰，一望就是好几个钟头，一边幻想那是魔龙吐出的烈火。有时候我会幻想我老爸被火烧死，有时候则是我老姐。”琼恩•雪诺一脸既害怕又惊奇的表情，提利昂看了哈哈大笑，“小杂种，别用那种眼光看我，我知道你心里在想什么，你也有过这样的梦吧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1083');"><p>"No," Jon Snow said, horrified. "I wouldn’t?.?.?.?"

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1084');"><p>"No? Never?" Tyrion raised an eyebrow. "Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you. I’m certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own. And your brother Robb, he’s always been kind, and why not? He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall. And your father?.?.?.?he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Night’s Watch?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1084" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没有？从来没有？”提利昂抬起一边眉毛，“那想必史塔克一家人待你不薄？想必夫人对你也视如己出啰？还有你那异母兄弟罗柏，向来都跟你很亲是罢？为什么不呢？他得到临冬城，你得到的却是绝境长城。至于你父亲大人嘛……他一定也有正当理由，才会把你送去当守夜人……。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1085');"><p>"Stop it," Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger. "The Night’s Watch is a noble calling!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1085" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不要再说了，”琼恩•雪诺脸色阴沉地怒道，“加入守夜人是神圣的使命！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1086');"><p>Tyrion laughed. "You’re too smart to believe that. The Night’s Watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm. I’ve seen you looking at Yoren and his boys. Those are your new brothers, Jon Snow, how do you like them? Sullen peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards like you all wind up on the Wall, watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. The good part is there are no grumkins or snarks, so it’s scarcely dangerous work. The bad part is you freeze your balls off, but since you’re not allowed to breed anyway, I don’t suppose that matters."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1086" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂笑笑。“聪明如你，怎会相信这种屁话？守夜人军团是个专门接收全国各地人渣废物的垃圾场，我瞧见了你看尤伦和他手下那两小子的神色，他们就是你的新弟兄，琼恩•雪诺，你可还喜欢？一脸死相的农奴、欠债鬼、盗猎者、强奸犯、小偷，还有像你这样的私生子通通都发配到长城上来，负责防范你奶妈小时候告诉你的各种古灵精怪。往好的方面想嘛，根本就没有什么古灵精怪；可是往坏处想呢，那地方冷得连命根子都要冻掉。不过既然原本就不准你生育后代，我看也没什么关系。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1087');"><p>"Stop it!" the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1087" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不要说了！”男孩尖叫着前跨一步，双手握拳，眼看就要掉下泪来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1088');"><p>Suddenly, absurdly, Tyrion felt guilty. He took a step forward, intending to give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1088" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂突然很荒谬地有股罪恶感，他也朝前走了一步，想拍拍男孩肩膀安慰他，或是道声歉。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1089');"><p>He never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at him. One moment he was walking toward Snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground, the book spinning away from him as he fell, the breath going out of him at the sudden impact, his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. As he tried to get up, his back spasmed painfully. He must have wrenched it in the fall. He ground his teeth in frustration, grabbed a root, and pulled himself back to a sitting position. "Help me," he said to the boy, reaching up a hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1089" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那只狼究竟是从什么地方出现的，他自始至终没有瞧见。前一刻他正朝雪诺走去，下一刻已被迎面扑倒在坚石地上，手中的书飞出老远。他被撞得喘不过气来，满嘴都是泥土血腥和枯枝腐叶。等他挣扎着想起身，背部却又剧烈地痉挛，一定是摔倒的时候扭了。他气恼地咬紧牙根，勾着一节树根，勉强坐祝“帮帮我罢。”他朝男孩伸出手。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1090');"><p>And suddenly the wolf was between them. He did not growl. The damned thing never made a sound. He only looked at him with those bright red eyes, and showed him his teeth, and that was more than enough. Tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt. "Don’t help me, then. I’ll sit right here until you leave."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1090" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>突然，狼又出现在两人之间，它没有吼叫——这只该死的东西从不发出半点声音——只是用那双灿亮的红眼打量他，露出满口尖牙，这就够吓人的了。提利昂咕哝一声缩回地上。“不帮就算了，我就在这里，等你走了再说。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1091');"><p>Jon Snow stroked Ghost’s thick white fur, smiling now. "Ask me nicely."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1092');"><p>Tyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and crushed it out with a will. It was not the first time in his life he had been humiliated, and it would not be the last. Perhaps he even deserved this. "I should be very grateful for your kind assistance, Jon," he said mildly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1092" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂•兰尼斯特只觉体内一股怒气逐渐酝酿，只好强自按捺。这不是他这辈子头一次遭人羞辱，肯定也不是最后一次，何况这次还是他自讨苦吃。“琼恩，如果你肯出手相助，我将非常感激。”他温和地说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1093');"><p>"Down, Ghost," the boy said. The direwolf sat on his haunches. Those red eyes never left Tyrion. Jon came around behind him, slid his hands under his arms, and lifted him easily to his feet. Then he picked up the book and handed it back.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1093" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“白灵，坐下。”男孩命令，冰原狼听罢蹲坐下来，那对红眼却始终不曾离开提利昂。琼恩绕到他身后，把手伸到他腋下，轻松地扶他起来，然后捡书递给他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1094');"><p>"Why did he attack me?" Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf. He wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1094" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“刚才它为什么攻击我？”提利昂问，他斜眼瞟了冰原狼一眼，用手背揩了揩嘴里的血污和泥巴。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1095');"><p>"Maybe he thought you were a grumkin."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1095" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“说不定他以为你就是古灵精怪哟。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1096');"><p>Tyrion glanced at him sharply. Then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission. "Oh, gods," he said, choking on his laughter and shaking his head, "I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin. What does he do to snarks?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1096" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂瞪了他一眼，接着放声大笑，那是一股他全然没有预期的原始笑意。“噢，诸神在上，”他笑得差点岔了气，不住摇头，“我想我看起来确实蛮像的嘛！那要是他遇上真的古灵精怪会有何反应啊？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1097');"><p>"You don’t want to know." Jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to Tyrion.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1098');"><p>Tyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted his head, and squeezed a long stream into his mouth. The wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly. He held out the skin to Jon Snow. "Want some?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1098" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂拉开塞子，侧着头喝了一大口，葡萄酒宛如一泓冷火，流过他的喉咙，温暖他的脾胃。他把皮囊传给琼恩•雪诺。“你来点？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1099');"><p>The boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow. "It’s true, isn’t it?" he said when he was done. "What you said about the Night’s Watch."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1102');"><p>Tyrion grinned at him. "That’s good, bastard. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1102" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂朝他嘿嘿一笑。“私生子，真有你的。大部分的人宁可否认事实，也不愿面对真相。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1103');"><p>"Most men," the boy said. "But not you."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1104');"><p>"No," Tyrion admitted, "not me. I seldom even dream of dragons anymore. There are no dragons." He scooped up the fallen bearskin. "Come, we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1104" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说得对，”提利昂同意，“不是我。现在我连龙都很少去想了，这世上没有龙了。”他捡起掉落在地的熊皮。“走，我们还是趁你叔叔没出来找人之前回营去罢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1105');"><p>The walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back. Jon Snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots, but Tyrion shook him off. He would make his own way, as he had all his life. Still, the camp was a welcome sight. The shelters had been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield against the wind. The horses had been fed and a fire had been laid. Yoren sat on a stone, skinning a squirrel. The savory smell of stew filled Tyrion’s nostrils. He dragged himself over to where his man Morrec was tending the stewpot. Wordlessly, Morrec handed him the ladle. Tyrion tasted and handed it back. "More pepper," he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1105" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>回营的路虽然不长，但地面崎岖不平，等到赶回营区，他的双腿已经抽筋得厉害。琼恩•雪诺伸手准备帮他跨越一丛纠结繁密的树根，但提利昂却挥手拒绝了。他要自己走自己的路，一如他这一生。营地是一副令人欣喜的景象：人们围着一座早已废弃的庄舍倾颓的墙壁，搭起挡风的遮蔽，马儿都已喂饱，营火也生起来了，尤伦坐在一块石头上剥松鼠的皮。浓汤的香味溢满提利昂的鼻腔。他一跛一拐地拖着脚，走到正在搅拌热汤的仆人莫里斯身旁。莫里斯一言不发地把长柄杓递给他，提利昂尝了一口后交回去。“再多加点胡椒。”他说。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1108');"><p>The squirrel gave some body to the stew, and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night around their fire.

</p></origin><translate id="div_1108" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那只松鼠为肉汤添了点美味，当晚他们就围坐在营火边，配着黑面包和硬乳酪吃。提利昂让大家分享他的美酒，直喝到连尤伦都满脸通红。接着，大伙便一个个起身回帐篷去睡了，只剩下抽到头班守夜的琼恩•雪诺。
