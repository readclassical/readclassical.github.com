</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1817');"><p>Are you certain that you must leave us so soon?" the Lord Commander asked him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1817" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你真急着要走？”总司令问他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1818');"><p>"Past certain, Lord Mormont," Tyrion replied. "My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me. He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1818" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“急不可待啊，莫尔蒙大人。”提利昂答道，“不然詹姆老哥就要担心我出了事，搞不好还以为您劝说我加入黑衣军了呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1819');"><p>"Would that I could." Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist. Old as he was, the Lord Commander still had the strength of a bear. "You’re a cunning man, Tyrion. We have need of men of your sort on the Wall."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1819" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“果真能如此倒好。”莫尔蒙拣起一只蟹爪，喀啦一声用手剥开。总司令年纪虽然大了，却仍然有熊一般的力量。“提利昂，你生了副好头脑，长城守军很需要你这样的人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1820');"><p>Tyrion grinned. "Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord Mormont." As they laughed, he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another. The crabs had arrived from Eastwatch only this morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and they were succulent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1820" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂嘻笑道：“莫尔蒙大人，为您这句话，我一定得把全国的侏儒通通找来给您。”趁众人哄堂大笑，他把蟹角的肉吸进嘴，伸手又拿一只。这些螃蟹当天早上才从东海望运来，送到的时候还冷冻在冰桶里，因此特别鲜美多汁。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1821');"><p>Ser Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile. "Lannister mocks us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1821" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾里沙•索恩爵士是席间惟一没笑的人。“这兰尼斯特明明是在讽刺我们。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1822');"><p>"Only you, Ser Alliser," Tyrion said. This time the laughter round the table had a nervous, uncertain quality to it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1822" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不是‘你们’，艾里沙爵士，是你。”提利昂道。这次席间的笑声里隐隐带着焦虑不安的气氛。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1823');"><p>Thorne’s black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing. "You have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man. Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1823" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>索恩盯住提利昂，黑眼睛里带着憎恨。“我看你个头虽然半个人都不到，说起话来倒是口无遮拦。或许我们应该下场子较量较量。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1824');"><p>"Why?" asked Tyrion. "The crabs are here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1824" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“何苦呢？”提利昂问，“螃蟹都在这儿呐。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1825');"><p>The remark brought more guffaws from the others. Ser Alliser stood up, his mouth a tight line. "Come and make your japes with steel in your hand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1825" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>此话一出，众人更是捧腹狂笑。艾里沙爵士抿紧嘴唇，站了起来。“有种你拿上武器，再开玩笑试试看。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1826');"><p>Tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand. "Why, I have steel in my hand, Ser Alliser, although it appears to be a crab fork. Shall we duel?" He hopped up on his chair and began poking at Thorne’s chest with the tiny fork. Roars of laughter filled the tower room. Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander’s mouth as he began to gasp and choke. Even his raven joined in, cawing loudly from above the window. "Duel! Duel! Duel!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1826" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂故意看看自己右手。“哎呀，艾里沙爵士，这会儿我不就握着武器嘛，虽然只是把吃螃蟹的叉子。怎么，咱们要不要比划比划？”他跳上椅子，开始用那把小叉子戳索恩的胸膛。人们的笑声简直连屋顶都要掀翻。总司令更是连蟹肉都喷了出来，呛得边咳嗽边喘气。他的乌鸦也没闲着，从窗边大声怪叫：“比划！比划！比划！”.
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1827');"><p>Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1827" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾里沙•索恩爵士僵着身子离开大厅，那模样就像胸前被人插了一把匕首。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1828');"><p>Mormont was still gasping for breath. Tyrion pounded him on the back. "To the victor goes the spoils," he called out. "I claim Thorne’s share of the crabs."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1828" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙仍然喘不过气，提利昂拍拍他的背。“战利品归胜利者所有，”他高声宣布，“索恩的螃蟹是我的啦。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1829');"><p>Finally the Lord Commander recovered himself. "You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so," he scolded.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1829" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>总司令好不容易恢复过来。“你看你把咱们艾里沙爵士整成什么样了，你真是个坏心眼的家伙。”他责怪道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1830');"><p>Tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine. "If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him. I have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1830" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂正襟危坐，啜了口葡萄酒。“有人要在胸前划上辬靶，就该有挨箭的心理准备。比你们艾里沙爵士还有幽默感的死人我见得多了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1831');"><p>"Not so," objected the Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh, a man as round and red as a pomegranate. "You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1831" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这样说就不公平了。”总务长波文•马尔锡长得又红又胖，活像颗石榴。“你应该听听他帮手下受训的小鬼起的绰号有多可笑。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1832');"><p>Tyrion had heard a few of those droll names. "I’ll wager the lads have a few names for him as well," he said. "Chip the ice off your eyes, my good lords. Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables, not drilling your young warriors."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1832" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂知道几个这样的绰号。“我敢打赌那些小鬼帮他取的绰号也不少。”他说：“各位大人，擦亮你们的眼睛吧。艾里沙•索恩爵士能做的是清理马粪，而非训练新兵。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1833');"><p>"The Watch has no shortage of stableboys," Lord Mormont grumbled. "That seems to be all they send us these days. Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers. Ser Alliser is an anointed knight, one of the few to take the black since I have been Lord Commander. He fought bravely at King’s Landing."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1833" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“守夜人一点也不缺马夫。”莫尔蒙司令咕哝道，“这年头送来的都是这路货色。不是马僮，就是小偷或强奸犯。艾里沙爵士是我接任司令以来，参加黑衣军的少数几位经正式册封的骑士。他在君临之战中表现很英勇。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1834');"><p>"On the wrong side," Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly. "I ought to know, I was there on the battlements beside him. Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice. Take the black, or see our heads on spikes before evenfall. No offense intended, Tyrion."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1834" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“只可惜站错了队，”杰瑞米•莱克爵士冷冷地说，“偏偏我跟他一块犯傻。当时我同他站在城墙上，泰温•兰尼斯特开出的条件宽厚得紧，要嘛穿上黑衣，不然就等着天黑前头被插上枪尖。啊，提利昂，我这话可不是找你碴。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1835');"><p>"None taken, Ser Jaremy. My father is very fond of spiked heads, especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion. And a face as noble as yours, well, no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the King’s Gate. I think you would have looked very striking up there."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1835" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没关系，杰瑞米爵士。我老爸很爱把首级挂城墙上，尤其是惹过他的人。以您这张高贵的脸嘛，呃，我看他八成会把你的头挂上国王大门。我猜一定特别引人注目。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1836');"><p>"Thank you," Ser Jaremy replied with a sardonic smile.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1836" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“多谢你哟。”杰瑞米爵士面带讥讽地微笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1837');"><p>Lord Commander Mormont cleared his throat. "Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true, Tyrion. You do mock us and our noble purpose here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1837" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙司令清清喉咙。“提利昂，有时候我真觉得艾里沙爵士说得没错，你的确是在嘲弄我们和我们神圣的使命。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1838');"><p>Tyrion shrugged. "We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take ourselves too seriously. More wine, please." He held out his cup.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1838" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂耸耸肩。“莫尔蒙大人，我们不时需要被嘲弄嘲弄，以免生活太过严肃。请再帮我倒点酒。”他递出酒杯。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1839');"><p>As Rykker filled it for him, Bowen Marsh said, "You have a great thirst for a small man."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1839" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莱克一边帮他斟酒，波文•马尔锡一边说：“你个子不大，酒量倒是不小。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1840');"><p>"Oh, I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man," Maester Aemon said from the far end of the table. He spoke softly, yet the high officers of the Night’s Watch all fell quiet, the better to hear what the ancient had to say. "I think he is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1840" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“噢，我却觉得提利昂大人一点也不小。”坐在长桌末端的伊蒙学士说，守夜人部队的高级官员们立刻都安静下来，凝神倾听长者的话。“他是我们中的巨人，一个来到世界尽头的巨人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1841');"><p>Tyrion answered gently, "I’ve been called many things, my lord, but giant is seldom one of them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1841" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂轻声答道：“好师傅，我有过的绰号不老少，可 ‘巨人’还是头一遭听到。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1842');"><p>"Nonetheless," Maester Aemon said as his clouded, milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion’s face, "I think it is true."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1842" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是这样么，”伊蒙师傅道，他白浊的眼翳朝提利昂脸上移去。“我说的可是真心话。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1843');"><p>For once, Tyrion Lannister found himself at a loss for words. He could only bow his head politely and say, "You are too kind, Maester Aemon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1843" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂竟无言以对。他只有礼貌性地低头说：“伊蒙师傅，您太客气了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1844');"><p>The blind man smiled. He was a tiny thing, wrinkled and hairless, shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maester’s collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat. "I have been called many things, my lord," he said, "but kind is seldom one of them." This time Tyrion himself led the laughter.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1844" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>盲眼学士微微一笑。他是个瘦小的老人，满脸皱纹，头已全秃，畏缩于沉重的百年岁月之下，颈间学士项链上的各种金属松垮地挂在咽喉。“我受过的谬赞也不少，可 ‘客气’倒是头一遭听到。”这一回提利昂率先笑了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1845');"><p>Much later, when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left, Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes. "The kingsroad can be perilous this far north," the Lord Commander told him as they drank.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1845" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>晚膳用毕，旁人陆续离去之后，莫尔蒙请提利昂在火炉边坐下，递给他一杯烫过的酒，辛辣得使他眼泪都流了下来。“我们地处极北，国王大道这里的路段恐怕好生危险。”他们边喝酒，总司令官边说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1846');"><p>"I have Jyck and Morrec," Tyrion said, "and Yoren is riding south again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1846" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我有杰克和莫里斯，”提利昂道，“而且尤伦正好也要南下。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1847');"><p>"Yoren is only one man. The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell," Mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument. "Three men should be sufficient."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1847" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“尤伦一个人怎么够。守夜人会护送你到临冬城。”莫尔蒙的口气不容辩驳。“至少要三个人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1848');"><p>"If you insist, my lord," Tyrion said. "You might send young Snow. He would be glad for a chance to see his brothers."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1848" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“司令大人，那我就恭敬不如从命。”提利昂说，“您不妨派出雪诺那小子，让他跟兄弟见个面也好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1849');"><p>Mormont frowned through his thick grey beard. "Snow? Oh, the Stark bastard. I think not. The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them, the brothers and mothers and all that. A visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone. I know these things. My own blood kin?.?.?.?my sister Maege rules Bear Island now, since my son’s dishonor. I have nieces I have never seen." He took a swallow. "Besides, Jon Snow is only a boy. You shall have three strong swords, to keep you safe."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1849" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙隔着厚厚的灰胡子皱眉道：“雪诺？喔，你是说史塔克那个私生子啊。我看不妥。年轻人得忘掉他们过去的生活，不管兄弟还是老妈都得放下。回家探亲只会再度激起这些早该忘却的情感。我很清楚这些事。我自己的家人……自我儿子辱没家门，只剩我妹妹梅姬接手统治熊岛，我有好些外甥女都没见过。”他灌了口酒。“再说，雪诺只是个小鬼。我要派三个强壮的战士来确保你的安全。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1850');"><p>"I am touched by your concern, Lord Mormont." The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed, but not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from him. "I hope I can repay your kindness."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1850" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“莫尔蒙大人，我真是太感激您的关心了。”烈酒让提利昂飘飘欲醉，但还不至于醉到分不清熊老有事相求的地步。“希望我能回报您的恩情。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1851');"><p>"You can," Mormont said bluntly. "Your sister sits beside the king. Your brother is a great knight, and your father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms. Speak to them for us. Tell them of our need here. You have seen for yourself, my lord. The Night’s Watch is dying. Our strength is less than a thousand now. Six hundred here, two hundred in the Shadow Tower, even fewer at Eastwatch, and a scant third of those fighting men. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. Think on that. Should an attack come, I have three men to defend each mile of wall."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1851" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你当然能，”莫尔蒙直言不讳，“令姐贵为当今王后，令兄是个伟大的骑士，令尊更是当今七国最有权势的人物。请代我们向他们请愿，告诉他们我们是如何迫切地需要援助。大人，您也亲眼看到了，守夜人部队正在逐渐凋零。我们的人力只剩不到一千，六百守在这里， 两百在影子塔，东海望的驻军更少，而其中真正能作战的还不到三分之一——长城则足足有三百里之长。请您想想，要是敌人来袭，每一里我只能派三个人去守。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1852');"><p>"Three and a third," Tyrion said with a yawn.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1852" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“三又三分之一个。”提利昂打了个呵欠。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1853');"><p>Mormont scarcely seemed to hear him. The old man warmed his hands before the fire. "I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce’s son, lost on his first ranging. The Royce boy was green as summer grass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own command, saying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish to offend his lord father, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch. More fool I."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1853" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙似乎没在意他的话，老人伸手在火炉前取暖。“我派班扬•史塔克去找约恩•罗伊斯的儿子，他第一次出外巡逻便失踪了。罗伊斯那小子嫩得跟夏天的青草一样，可他偏要坚持亲自领队，说是身为骑士的职责。我因为不想冒犯他老爸，便由他去了。更愚蠢的是，我还派了两个部队里的顶尖好手跟他一道走。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1854');"><p>"Fool," the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes, ruffling its wings. "Fool," it called again. Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature. A pity.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1854" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“愚蠢。”乌鸦同意。提利昂抬头看去，鸟儿用珠子似的黑眼睛睥睨他，抖动着翅膀。“愚蠢。”它又叫。他很想勒死这只鸟，但想到老莫尔蒙必定会生气，只好作罢。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1855');"><p>The Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird. "Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall," he went on, "yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled. I should never have believed it, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell. Of Royce, there is no word. One deserter and two men lost, and now Ben Stark too has gone missing." He sighed deeply. "Who am I to send searching after him? In two years I will be seventy. Too old and too weary for the burden I bear, yet if I set it down, who will pick it up? Alliser Thorne? Bowen Marsh? I would have to be as blind as Maester Aemon not to see what they are. The Night’s Watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men. Apart from the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps twenty who can read, and even fewer who can think, or plan, or lead. Once the Watch spent its summers building, and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it. Now it is all we can do to stay alive."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1855" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老司令官毫不理会那只惹人厌的鸟。“盖瑞年纪跟我差不多，但待在长城的时间更久。”他继续说下去，“但他后来似乎是背弃誓言逃跑了。我本来不相信，觉得再怎么也轮不到他，直到他的首级被史塔克大人从临冬城送了来。至于罗伊斯那小子，则是音讯全无。一个逃兵，两个下落不明，这会儿连班扬•史塔克也不见踪影。”他深深叹口气。“这下我该派谁去找他呢？再过两年我都七十了，又老又疲惫，没法再撑下去。然而要是我撒手不管，谁能接手？艾里沙•索恩？波文•马尔锡？若我连他们的真本事都看不清，我就跟伊蒙师傅一样瞎。如今的守夜人部队不过是群郁闷不乐的小伙子和身心俱疲的老头子组成的乌合之众罢了。除了今晚跟我同桌用餐的人，我手下大概只有二十个人识字，能思考、计划或领导的人更少。从前守夜人军团每逢夏季便大兴土木，每任司令官都会加高城墙，而今我们光维持现状都非常吃力。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1856');"><p>He was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized. He felt faintly embarrassed for the old man. Lord Mormont had spent a good part of his life on the Wall, and he needed to believe if those years were to have any meaning. "I promise, the king will hear of your need," Tyrion said gravely, "and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well." And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word. He left the rest unsaid; that King Robert would ignore him, Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses, and Jaime would only laugh.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1856" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>提利昂明白对方话中的迫切，他不禁为眼前这名老人微微感到难过。这位前伯爵大半生都在长城度过，他需要相信自己这些年活得有意义。“我保证会向国王陛下禀报此事，”提利昂郑重地说，“我也会向家父和家兄提起。”这可不是阳奉阴违，提利昂•兰尼斯特向来说话算话。只是他没把其他的部分说出来：劳勃国王不会理睬他，泰温公爵会问他是否神臹不清，詹姆则只会哈哈大笑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1857');"><p>"You are a young man, Tyrion," Mormont said. "How many winters have you seen?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1857" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“提利昂，你还年轻，”莫尔蒙道，“经历过几个冬天？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1858');"><p>He shrugged. "Eight, nine. I misremember."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1858" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他耸耸肩。“八九个罢，我记不清了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1859');"><p>"And all of them short."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1859" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“而且都不长，对吧？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1860');"><p>"As you say, my lord." He had been born in the dead of winter, a terrible cruel one that the maesters said had lasted near three years, but Tyrion’s earliest memories were of spring.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1860" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您说得没错，大人。”他降生于严冬之际，据学士们说，那是特别酷寒的一次冬天，整整长达三年之久，然而提利昂最早的记忆却是春季。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1861');"><p>"When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come. This summer has lasted nine years, Tyrion, and a tenth will soon be upon us. Think on that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1861" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我打小的时候，便听说接着长夏而来的会是更漫长的冬季。这次的夏天已经过了九年，提利昂，很快便要进入第十个年头。想想看这意味着什么罢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1862');"><p>"When I was a boy," Tyrion replied, "my wet nurse told me that one day, if men were good, the gods would give the world a summer without ending. Perhaps we’ve been better than we thought, and the Great Summer is finally at hand." He grinned.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1862" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“而我小时候呢，”提利昂应道，“我奶妈告诉我，倘若有朝一日，人们都能和睦相处，知礼向善，那么诸神便会让盛夏永无止尽。说不定是咱们表现得比意料中好，而传说中的永夏已经降临了哪。”他嘻嘻一笑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1863');"><p>The Lord Commander did not seem amused. "You are not fool enough to believe that, my lord. Already the days grow shorter. There can be no mistake, Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in accord with his own. The end of summer stares us in the face." Mormont reached out and clutched Tyrion tightly by the hand. "You must make them understand. I tell you, my lord, the darkness is coming.

Bundled thickly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander’s Keep. He set off across the yard for his own chambers in the King’s Tower, walking as briskly as his legs could manage. Patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night’s crust, and his breath steamed before him like a banner.

It would be his last chance, he thought; tomorrow he would ride south, and he could not imagine why he would ever want to return to this frozen desolation. The King’s Tower was before him, with its promise of warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion found himself walking past it, toward the vast pale palisade of the Wall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1872" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>突然，他心生怪异的狂念，决定再看看世界尽头一眼。这是他这辈子最后的机会罢，他心想，明天就要启程南归，而他实在想不出有何理由重回这冰封的不毛之地。国王塔近在眼前，提利昂却不由自主地绕过它，绕过垂手可得的暖意和温床，朝长城这广大的苍白冰壁走去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1873');"><p>A wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge rough-hewn beams sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place. Back and forth it switched, clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning. The black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion’s legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent. He went instead to the iron cage beside the well, clambered inside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1875');"><p>He moved upward slowly, by fits and starts at first, then more smoothly. The ground fell away beneath him, the cage swung, and Tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars. He could feel the cold of the metal even through his gloves. Morrec had a fire burning in his room, he noted with approval, but the Lord Commander’s tower was dark. The Old Bear had more sense than he did, it seemed.

You could see how stark and empty it was from up here; windowless keeps, crumbling walls, courtyards choked with broken stone. Farther off, he could see the lights of Mole’s Town, the little village half a league south along the kingsroad, and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where icy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains. The rest of the world was a bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow.

Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice. A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch, while a second held the cage with a gloved hand. Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed, and they were plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black. "And what will you be wanting, this time of night?" the one by the winch asked.

And then he was alone.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1881');"><p>It was bitingly cold up here, and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover. The top of the Wall was wider than the kingsroad often was, so Tyrion had no fear of falling, although the footing was slicker than he would have liked. The brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways, but the weight of countless footsteps would melt the Wall beneath, so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel, swallowing it, until the path was bare again and it was time to crush more stone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1881" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>冷得刺骨，风像急切的情人般撕扯他的衣服。长城比此地的国王大道还要宽敞，所以提利昂无须担心失足坠落，可地表的确太滑。黑衣弟兄们在通道上铺满了碎石，但长时间的踩踏早已磨平了地面，于是冰渐渐填满砂砾间的缝隙，吞噬了碎石。等到通道被再度磨平，又得重新铺上碎石。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1882');"><p>Still, it was nothing that Tyrion could not manage. He looked off to the east and west, at the Wall stretching before him, a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side. West, he decided, for no special reason, and he began to walk that way, following the pathway nearest the north edge, where the gravel looked freshest.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1883');"><p>His bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and his legs complained more loudly with every step, but Tyrion ignored them. The wind swirled around him, gravel crunched beneath his boots, while ahead the white ribbon followed the lines of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western horizon. He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, its base sunk deep into the Wall. The throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; it lay there like a broken toy, half-embedded in the ice.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1883" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>暴露在外的双颊被冻得通红，双脚也早就在抗议，但他不加理会。狂风在他耳际怒吼，碎石在他脚下嘎吱作响，长城在他前方沿丘陵蜿蜒，有如白色蝴蝶结般渐渐升高，最后消失于西边的地平线。他走过一台高如城墙的庞大投石机，它的底座深深地陷入长城，投掷臂被拆下来维修，却忘了装回去，于是便像个坏掉的玩具般躺在那儿，半掩盖在冰层里。

Tyrion had heard that elsewhere along the Wall, between the three fortresses, the wildwood had come creeping back over the decades, that there were places where grey-green sentinels and pale white weirwoods had taken root in the shadow of the Wall itself, but Castle Black had a prodigious appetite for firewood, and here the forest was still kept at bay by the axes of the black brothers.

From up here Tyrion could see it, the dark trees looming beyond the stretch of open ground, like a second wall built parallel to the first, a wall of night. Few axes had ever swung in that black wood, where even the moonlight could not penetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and grasping limb. Out there the trees grew huge, and the rangers said they seemed to brood and knew not men. It was small wonder the Night’s Watch named it the haunted forest.

His jokes of grumkins and snarks no longer seemed quite so droll.

"The first night they sent me up here, I thought, Uncle Benjen will ride back tonight, and I’ll see him first and blow the horn. He never came, though. Not that night and not any night."
