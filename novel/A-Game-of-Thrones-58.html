</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5228');"><p>The walls of the throne room had been stripped bare, the hunting tapestries that King Robert loved taken down and stacked in the corner in an untidy heap.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5228" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王座厅里，劳勃国王生前最喜爱的挂毯织锦通通被扯了下来，杂乱无章地堆在角落，如今四壁萧然。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5229');"><p>Ser Mandon Moore went to take his place under the throne beside two of his fellows of the Kingsguard. Sansa hovered by the door, for once unguarded. The queen had given her freedom of the castle as a reward for being good, yet even so, she was escorted everywhere she went. "Honor guards for my daughter-to-be," the queen called them, but they did not make Sansa feel honored.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5229" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>曼登•穆尔爵士前去守在王座底，与他另外两名御林铁卫弟兄一道站岗，所以暂时无人看管在门边徘徊的珊莎。太后赐给她在城堡里自由来去的权利，作为她表现良好的奖赏。但即便如此，不论她走到何处，身旁依旧有人紧随。“这是给我准媳妇的荣誉护卫。”太后这么称呼他们，然而珊莎却一点也不觉得受尊重。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5230');"><p>"Freedom of the castle" meant that she could go wherever she chose within the Red Keep so long as she promised not to go beyond the walls, a promise Sansa had been more than willing to give. She couldn’t have gone beyond the walls anyway. The gates were watched day and night by Janos Slynt’s gold cloaks, and Lannister house guards were always about as well. Besides, even if she could leave the castle, where would she go? It was enough that she could walk in the yard, pick flowers in Myrcella’s garden, and visit the sept to pray for her father. Sometimes she prayed in the godswood as well, since the Starks kept the old gods.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5230" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>所谓“在城堡里自由来去”，指的是她可以在红堡里任意行动，只要她答应不走出城墙以外。这个要求珊莎倒是很乐于配合，一来城门日夜有杰诺斯•史林特的金袍卫士或兰尼斯特家的武士看守，她本来就不可能出去；二来，就算她真的离开城堡，又能去什么地方呢? 只要能在广场里散散步，到弥赛拉的花园采几朵花，或是造访圣堂，为父亲祈祷，她便心满意足了。有时候她也会在神木林祷告，因为史塔克家族是信奉古老诸神的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5231');"><p>This was the first court session of Joffrey’s reign, so Sansa looked about nervously. A line of Lannister house guards stood beneath the western windows, a line of gold-cloaked City Watchmen beneath the east. Of smallfolk and commoners, she saw no sign, but under the gallery a cluster of lords great and small milled restlessly. There were no more than twenty, where a hundred had been accustomed to wait upon King Robert.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5231" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>今天，是乔佛里登基后首次上朝听政，珊莎很紧张地四处张望。西窗下站了一排兰尼斯特卫士，东窗下则是身穿金色披风的都城守卫队。她没见着任何平民百姓，旁听席上也只有一小群贵族焦躁不安地来回走动。他们为数不过二十，从前劳勃国王的时代，出席者动辄百人以上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5232');"><p>Sansa slipped in among them, murmuring greetings as she worked her way toward the front. She recognized black-skinned Jalabhar Xho, gloomy Ser Aron Santagar, the Redwyne twins Horror and Slobber?.?.?.?only none of them seemed to recognize her. Or if they did, they shied away as if she had the grey plague. Sickly Lord Gyles covered his face at her approach and feigned a fit of coughing, and when funny drunken Ser Dontos started to hail her, Ser Balon Swann whispered in his ear and he turned away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5232" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎走进旁听席，一边穿梭着往前排移动，一边喃喃向人们问好。她认出黑皮肤的贾拉巴•梭尔，神情郁闷的艾伦•桑塔加爵士，以及雷德温家的双胞胎恐怖爵士和流口水爵士……可他们却似乎都不认得她。或者他们认得，却把她当瘟疫般避之惟恐不及。憔悴的盖尔斯伯爵一见她走近，便遮住脸，假装剧烈咳嗽；而喝得醉醺醺，人又顶滑稽的唐托斯爵士正要向她打招呼，只见巴隆•吏文爵士在他耳边低语了几句，他便转开头去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5233');"><p>And so many others were missing. Where had the rest of them gone? Sansa wondered. Vainly, she searched for friendly faces. Not one of them would meet her eyes. It was as if she had become a ghost, dead before her time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5233" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>还有好多好多人都不见了。其他人到哪里去了?珊莎纳闷。她徒劳无功地搜索友善的脸孔，然而谁都不愿正眼瞧她。她仿佛成了幽魂，还来寿终正寝，便已宣告死亡。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5234');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle was seated alone at the council table, seemingly asleep, his hands clasped together atop his beard. She saw Lord Varys hurry into the hall, his feet making no sound. A moment later Lord Baelish entered through the tall doors in the rear, smiling. He chatted amiably with Ser Balon and Ser Dontos as he made his way to the front. Butterflies fluttered nervously in Sansa’s stomach. I shouldn’t be afraid, she told herself. I have nothing to be afraid of, it will all come out well, Joff loves me and the queen does too, she said so.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5234" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔大学士独自坐在议事桌边，两手撑在胡子下，那样子像是睡着了。接着，她看见瓦里斯伯爵匆匆忙忙地进入大厅，走路没有半点声音。过了一会儿，贝里席伯爵也笑盈盈地从大门走进来，一边和蔼可亲地与巴隆爵士和唐托斯爵士闲话家常，一边朝大厅前方移动。珊莎的肚子绞成一团，好似有成群蝴蝶飞舞。我不该害怕的，她告诉自己，我没什么好怕的，一切都会圆满收场，因为小乔爱我，太后也爱我，她亲口说的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5235');"><p>A herald’s voice rang out. "All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of his Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. All hail his lady mother, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent, Light of the West, and Protector of the Realm."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5235" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>司仪的声音响起：“恭迎安达尔人、洛伊拿人和先民的国王，七国统治者，拜拉席恩家族与兰尼斯特家族的乔佛里一世陛下。恭迎陛下的母亲大人，西境之光，全境守护者，舏政太后，兰尼斯特家族的瑟曦陛下。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5236');"><p>Ser Barristan Selmy, resplendent in white plate, led them in. Ser Arys Oakheart escorted the queen, while Ser Boros Blount walked beside Joffrey, so six of the Kingsguard were now in the hall, all the White Swords save Jaime Lannister alone. Her prince, no, her king now!, took the steps of the Iron Throne two at a time, while his mother was seated with the council. Joff wore plush black velvets slashed with crimson, a shimmering cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar, and on his head a golden crown crusted with rubies and black diamonds.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5236" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一身灿烂白甲的巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士带领他们走进来，亚历斯•奥克赫特爵士护送太后，柏洛斯•布劳恩爵士则走在乔佛里旁边。眼下六名御林铁卫都在大厅，众白骑士齐聚一堂，只有詹姆•兰尼斯特缺席。她的白马王子——不对，是她的国王了!——三步并作两步地爬上铁王座的阶梯，他的母后则和重臣们坐在一起。小乔身穿绣红线的黑天鹅绒外衣，肩披闪闪发光的高领金缕披风，头戴镶嵌红玉黑钻石的黄金宝冠。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5237');"><p>When Joffrey turned to look out over the hall, his eye caught Sansa’s. He smiled, seated himself, and spoke. "It is a king’s duty to punish the disloyal and reward those who are true. Grand Maester Pycelle, I command you to read my decrees."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5237" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔佛里转头环顾大厅，与珊莎四目相交，他面露微笑，缓缓坐下，然后开口道：“惩治叛徒，奖励忠臣，此乃国王职责所在。派席尔大学士，我命你宣读我的判决。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5238');"><p>Pycelle pushed himself to his feet. He was clad in a magnificent robe of thick red velvet, with an ermine collar and shiny gold fastenings. From a drooping sleeve, heavy with gilded scrollwork, he drew a parchment, unrolled it, and began to read a long list of names, commanding each in the name of king and council to present themselves and swear their fealty to Joffrey. Failing that, they would be adjudged traitors, their lands and titles forfeit to the throne.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5238" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔站起来，他衣着华丽，身穿厚重的红天鹅绒长袍，貂皮衣领，亮金饰带，衣袖低垂，上面满是镀金涡形装饰。他从袖子里抽出一卷羊皮纸，展开之后，开始宣读一长串的名单，并以国王和重臣之名，命令他们即刻上朝宣誓效忠，倘若不从，将被视作叛徒，其领地和封号均由王室收回。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5239');"><p>The names he read made Sansa hold her breath. Lord Stannis Baratheon, his lady wife, his daughter. Lord Renly Baratheon. Both Lord Royces and their sons. Ser Loras Tyrell. Lord Mace Tyrell, his brothers, uncles, sons. The red priest, Thoros of Myr. Lord Beric Dondarrion. Lady Lysa Arryn and her son, the little Lord Robert. Lord Hoster Tully, his brother Ser Brynden, his son Ser Edmure. Lord Jason Mallister. Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches. Lord Tytos Blackwood. Lord Walder Frey and his heir Ser Stevron. Lord Karyl Vance. Lord Jonos Bracken. Lady Sheila Whent. Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and all his sons. So many, she thought as Pycelle read on and on, it will take a whole flock of ravens to send out these commands.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5239" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他念出的名字令珊莎屏住了呼吸：史坦尼斯•拜拉席恩公爵夫妇和他们的女儿，蓝礼公爵，罗伊斯伯爵兄弟和他们的儿子，洛拉斯•提利尔爵士，梅斯•提利尔公爵及其兄弟、叔父和儿子，密尔的红袍僧索罗斯，贝里•唐德利恩伯爵，莱沙•艾林夫人和她的儿子小劳勃，霍斯特•徒利公爵及其弟布林登爵士、其子艾德慕爵士，杰森•梅利斯特伯爵，边疆地的布莱斯•卡伦伯爵，泰陀斯•布莱伍德伯爵，瓦德•佛雷侯爵和他的继承人史提夫伦爵士，卡列尔•凡斯伯爵，裘诺•布雷肯伯爵，希拉•河安伯爵夫人，多恩亲王道朗•马泰尔及其所有子嗣。好多人啊，她一边听派席尔念个不休，心里一边想，光把这些命令送出去，就得用上一整群的渡鸦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5240');"><p>And at the end, near last, came the names Sansa had been dreading. Lady Catelyn Stark. Robb Stark. Brandon Stark, Rickon Stark, Arya Stark. Sansa stifled a gasp. Arya. They wanted Arya to present herself and swear an oath?.?.?.?it must mean her sister had fled on the galley, she must be safe at Winterfell by now?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_5240" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>最后，接近末尾时，珊莎害怕已久的名字终于出现：凯特琳•史塔克夫人，罗柏•史塔克，布兰登•史塔克，瑞肯•史塔克，艾莉亚•史塔克。珊莎差点没叫出声。艾莉亚?他们竟然要艾莉亚上朝宣誓效忠……这么说来妹妹肯定已经乘船逃走，安全地回到临冬城了……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5241');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle rolled up the list, tucked it up his left sleeve, and pulled another parchment from his right. He cleared his throat and resumed. "In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, take up the office of Hand of the King, to speak with his voice, lead his armies against his enemies, and carry out his royal will. So the king has decreed. The small council consents.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5241" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔大学士卷起名单，塞进左手袖子，然后从右边袖子抽出另一张羊皮纸。他清清喉咙，继续念道：“为取代叛徒艾德•史塔克，遵照国王陛下的意愿，由凯岩城公爵暨西境守护泰温•兰尼斯特接任国王之手一职，以国王之名统理政事，率军讨平乱党，传达其意旨。陛下有令，重臣赞同。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5242');"><p>"In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon, it is the wish of His Grace that his lady mother, the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, who has ever been his staunchest support, be seated upon his small council, that she may help him rule wisely and with justice. So the king has decreed. The small council consents."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5243');"><p>Sansa heard a soft murmuring from the lords around her, but it was quickly stilled. Pycelle continued.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5243" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎听见四周的贵族窃窃私语，然而耳语声很快平息下来。派席尔继续念诵：“对于尽忠职守之君临都城守卫队长杰诺斯•史林特，国王陛下亦希望将其立刻擢升为贵族之列，并赐予历史悠久之赫伦堡及其所有封地税赋，其子嗣将世代继承此等荣耀，万世不辍。由是，陛下有令，史林特伯爵即刻成为朝廷重臣，助其统御国事。陛下有令，重臣赞同。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5244');"><p>"It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant, Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch of King’s Landing, be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the end of time. It is moreover his command that Lord Slynt be seated immediately upon his small council, to assist in the governance of the realm. So the king has decreed. The small council consents."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5244" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎的眼角余光瞥见杰诺斯•史林特走了进来。这回议论声更大，且夹杂了愤怒的话音。许多拥有几千年族史的高傲领主很不情愿让到两旁，好让这头顶渐秃，面目如蛙的平民过去。他的黑天鹅绒长衫上镶了纯金鳞片，每走一步就丁当轻响，肩头则是黑金相间的锦缎格子披风。两名相貌丑陋的男孩走在他前面，步履踉跄地举着与他们等高的金属重盾，这必定是他的儿子无疑。他为自己选择的家徽是一根金色的染血长枪，底面漆黑如夜。珊莎见了不禁手上起了鸡皮疙瘩。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5245');"><p>Sansa glimpsed motion from the corner of her eye as Janos Slynt made his entrance. This time the muttering was louder and angrier. Proud lords whose houses went back thousands of years made way reluctantly for the balding, frog-faced commoner as he marched past. Golden scales had been sewn onto the black velvet of his doublet and rang together softly with each step. His cloak was checked black-and-gold satin. Two ugly boys who must have been his sons went before him, struggling with the weight of a heavy metal shield as tall as they were. For his sigil he had taken a bloody spear, gold on a night-black field. The sight of it raised goose prickles up and down Sansa’s arms.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5245" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>等史林特伯爵就位后，派席尔国师继续念：“最后，于此密谋四起、动乱不堪的危殆之际，吾人备受爱戴的劳勃国王新近驾崩，吾等重臣认为乔佛里国王之生命安 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5246');"><p>As Lord Slynt took his place, Grand Maester Pycelle resumed. "Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, with our beloved Robert so lately dead, it is the view of the council that the life and safety of King Joffrey is of paramount importance?.?.?.?" He looked to the queen.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5248');"><p>Ser Barristan had been standing at the foot of the Iron Throne, as still as any statue, but now he went to one knee and bowed his head. "Your Grace, I am yours to command."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5253');"><p>The new-made lord, Janos Slynt, spoke up, his voice heavy and blunt. "Her Grace is trying to tell you that you are relieved as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5253" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时新科贵族杰诺斯•史林特开了口，语气沉重，直截了当：“太后陛下的意思是，您御林铁卫队长的职务已被解除了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5254');"><p>The tall, white-haired knight seemed to shrink as he stood there, scarcely breathing. "Your Grace," he said at last. "The Kingsguard is a Sworn Brotherhood. Our vows are taken for life. Only death may relieve the Lord Commander of his sacred trust."
</p></origin><translate id="div_5254" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>高大的白发骑士站在原地，整个人仿佛顿时小了一圈，喘不过气来，“陛下，”最后他终于开口，“御林铁卫乃宣誓效命的兄弟，立下誓言，即为终身，惟死方能解除铁卫队长所负之神圣使命。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5255');"><p>"Whose death, Ser Barristan?" The queen’s voice was soft as silk, but her words carried the whole length of the hall. "Yours, or your king’s?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_5255" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“巴利斯坦爵士，敢问是谁的死?”太后的声音虽轻柔如丝，话中所言却震舑全场。“是你，还是你的国王?”

"I was chosen for the White Swords in my twenty-third year. It was all I had ever dreamed, from the moment I first took sword in hand. I gave up all claim to my ancestral keep.

He reached up and undid the clasps that held his cloak in place, and the heavy white garment slithered from his shoulders to fall in a heap on the floor. His helmet dropped with a clang. "I am a knight," he told them. He opened the silver fastenings of his breastplate and let that fall as well. "I shall die a knight."

He flung his sword at the foot of the Iron Throne. "Here, boy. Melt it down and add it to the others, if you like. It will do you more good than the swords in the hands of these five. Perhaps Lord Stannis will chance to sit on it when he takes your throne."

She was dressed in mourning, as a sign of respect for the dead king, but she had taken special care to make herself beautiful. Her gown was the ivory silk that the queen had given her, the one Arya had ruined, but she’d had them dye it black and you couldn’t see the stain at all. She had fretted over her jewelry for hours and finally decided upon the elegant simplicity of a plain silver chain.
