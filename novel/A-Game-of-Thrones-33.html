</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2902');"><p>The one-eared black tom arched his back and hissed at her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2902" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>独耳的黑公猫拱起背朝她嘶叫。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2903');"><p>Arya padded down the alley, balanced lightly on the balls of her bare feet, listening to the flutter of her heart, breathing slow deep breaths. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself, light as a feather. The tomcat watched her come, his eyes wary.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2903" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚沿着小路走，赤裸的脚跟保持平衡，倾听心脏疾跳，深呼吸缓吐气。静如影，她告诉自己，轻如羽。公猫看着她渐渐逼近，眼里充满警戒。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2904');"><p>Catching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were scabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the cook’s huge fat kitchen cat had been able to elude her, but Syrio had kept her at it day and night. When she’d run to him with her hands bleeding, he had said, "So slow? Be quicker, girl. Your enemies will give you more than scratches." He had dabbed her wounds with Myrish fire, which burned so bad she had had to bite her lip to keep from screaming. Then he sent her out after more cats.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2904" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>抓猫难。她手上到处都是未愈的抓痕，两脚膝盖则因跌倒擦伤，结满了疤。刚开始，连厨师养的那只厨房胖猫都能躲过她，但西利欧叫她日夜不停地练习。当她满手是血找上他时，他只说：“怎么这么慢？小妹妹，动作要快。等你遇到敌人，就不只是抓伤而已了。”他为她在伤口涂上密尔火，烫极了，她咬紧嘴唇才没大声尖叫。然后他又叫她继续去抓猫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2905');"><p>The Red Keep was full of cats: lazy old cats dozing in the sun, cold-eyed mousers twitching their tails, quick little kittens with claws like needles, ladies’ cats all combed and trusting, ragged shadows prowling the midden heaps. One by one Arya had chased them down and snatched them up and brought them proudly to Syrio Forel?.?.?.?all but this one, this one-eared black devil of a tomcat. "That’s the real king of this castle right there," one of the gold cloaks had told her. "Older than sin and twice as mean. One time, the king was feasting the queen’s father, and that black bastard hopped up on the table and snatched a roast quail right out of Lord Tywin’s fingers. Robert laughed so hard he like to burst. You stay away from that one, child."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2905" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>红堡到处都是猫：有在太阳下打盹的慵懒老猫、有冷眼摆尾的捕鼠猫、有爪子利如尖针的灵巧小猫、还有宫廷仕女养的猫，一身的毛梳理柔顺，乖巧听话，以及浑身脏兮兮、专门在垃圾堆里出没的黑猫。艾莉亚一只一只追踪到底，然后拎起来，得意万分地带回去给西利欧•佛瑞尔……如今就只差这只独耳的黑色小恶魔啦。“那家伙才是城堡里真正的王，”有位穿金披风的都城守卫告诉她，“不但老不死，还坏得跟什么似的。有次国王宴请他老丈人，结果那黑心肝的混球跳上桌，从泰温大人的手里大摇大摆地叼走一只烤鹌鹑。劳勃笑得快爆炸。小乖乖，你离那坏蛋远点。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2906');"><p>He had run her halfway across the castle; twice around the Tower of the Hand, across the inner bailey, through the stables, down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard and the barracks of the gold cloaks, along the base of the river wall and up more steps and back and forth over Traitor’s Walk, and then down again and through a gate and around a well and in and out of strange buildings until Arya didn’t know where she was.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2906" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>为了抓它，她跑辫半个城堡：绕了首相塔两圈，穿越内城中庭，钻进马厩，走下层层环绕的螺旋梯，经过小厨房、养猪场和都城守卫队的营房，顺着临河城墙的根基，再上楼梯，在叛徒走道上来来回回，然后又下楼，出一道门，绕过一口井，进出前方形形色色的建筑，到最后艾莉亚根本不知自己所在何处。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2907');"><p>Now at last she had him. High walls pressed close on either side, and ahead was a blank windowless mass of stone. Quiet as a shadow, she repeated, sliding forward, light as a feather.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2907" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这下她总算逮着它了。左右两边都是高墙，前方则是大片没开窗的石壁。静如影，她滑步向前，在心中重复，轻如羽。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2908');"><p>When she was three steps away from him, the tomcat bolted. Left, then right, he went; and right, then left, went Arya, cutting off his escape. He hissed again and tried to dart between her legs. Quick as a snake, she thought. Her hands closed around him. She hugged him to her chest, whirling and laughing aloud as his claws raked at the front of her leather jerkin. Ever so fast, she kissed him right between the eyes, and jerked her head back an instant before his claws would have found her face. The tomcat yowled and spit.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2908" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当她离它只剩三步之遥时，公猫倏地冲了出来。先往左，再往右，艾莉亚便先挡右，再挡左，切断了它逃生的路。它又发出嘶叫，试图从她两脚之间溜走。迅如蛇，她心想。她伸手抓住它，把它抱在胸前，乐得放声大笑，四处转圈，任由它的利爪撕扯她的皮上衣。她用更快的速度在它两眼之间轻吻一下，并在它伸出爪子抓她脸的前一刻缩回。公猫嘶吼着朝她吐口水。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2909');"><p>"What’s he doing to that cat?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2909" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他在跟那只猫做什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2910');"><p>Startled, Arya dropped the cat and whirled toward the voice. The tom bounded off in the blink of an eye. At the end of the alley stood a girl with a mass of golden curls, dressed as pretty as a doll in blue satin. Beside her was a plump little blond boy with a prancing stag sewn in pearls across the front of his doublet and a miniature sword at his belt. Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen, Arya thought. A septa as large as a draft horse hovered over them, and behind her two big men in crimson cloaks, Lannister house guards.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2910" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚吓了一跳，松开猫，旋身面对声音的来源。公猫转瞬间便一溜烟逃走。小巷的另一端站着一个满头金卷发、穿着蓝锦缎衣服、漂亮得像个洋娃娃似的女孩。她身边有个胖嘟嘟的金发小男孩，外衣胸前用珍珠绣了一只昂首腾跃的公鹿，腰际配了把微型剑。是弥赛菈公主和托曼王子，艾莉亚心想。他们身边跟了一个块头大得像犁马的修女，她背后还有两个兰尼斯特家的贴身护卫，都是牛高马大的汉子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2911');"><p>"What were you doing to that cat, boy?" Myrcella asked again, sternly. To her brother she said, "He’s a ragged boy, isn’t he? Look at him." She giggled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2911" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小弟弟，你在跟那只猫做什么啊？”弥赛菈口气严厉地再度发问，然后对弟弟说，“你瞧，他还真是个脏兮兮的小弟弟，对不对？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2912');"><p>"A ragged dirty smelly boy," Tommen agreed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2912" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“对，衣服破烂，又脏又臭的小弟弟。”托曼同意。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2913');"><p>They don’t know me, Arya realized. They don’t even know I’m a girl. Small wonder; she was barefoot and dirty, her hair tangled from the long run through the castle, clad in a jerkin ripped by cat claws and brown roughspun pants hacked off above her scabby knees. You don’t wear skirts and silks when you’re catching cats. Quickly she lowered her head and dropped to one knee. Maybe they wouldn’t recognize her. If they did, she would never hear the end of it. Septa Mordane would be mortified, and Sansa would never speak to her again from the shame.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2913" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们没认出我，艾莉亚这才明白，他们甚至不知道我是女孩。这也难怪，她光着脚丫，全身肮脏，在城堡里跑过一圈以后，头发乱成一团，身上的皮背心布满了猫的爪痕，粗布缝臸的棕色裤子膝盖以下都被割掉，露出伤疤辫布的双脚——抓猫总不能穿裙子或丝衣吧。她连忙低头，单膝跪下。他们要是认不出她来，就太好了。若是被认出来，她会吃不了兜着走的。因为这不但会丢光茉丹修女的脸，连珊莎也将觉得可耻，从此再不跟她说话。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2914');"><p>The old fat septa moved forward. "Boy, how did you come here? You have no business in this part of the castle."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2914" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>肥胖的老修女往前挪了挪。“小弟弟，你怎么跑到这里来的？你不该在城堡里到处乱跑喔。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2915');"><p>"You can’t keep this sort out," one of the red cloaks said. "Like trying to keep out rats."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2915" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没办法，这种人赶也赶不完，”一个红袍卫士道，“跟赶老鼠一样的道理。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2916');"><p>"Who do you belong to, boy?" the septa demanded. "Answer me. What’s wrong with you, are you mute?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2916" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小弟弟，你是谁家的孩子？”修女臼问，“告诉我。你怎么了？你是哑巴吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2917');"><p>Arya’s voice caught in her throat. If she answered, Tommen and Myrcella would know her for certain.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2917" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚的话音卡在喉咙里。如果她出声回答，托曼和弥赛菈一定会认出她来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2918');"><p>"Godwyn, bring him here," the septa said. The taller of the guardsmen started down the alley.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2918" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“高德温，把他带过来。”修女说。长得较高的那名卫士朝小巷的这边走来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2919');"><p>Panic gripped her throat like a giant’s hand. Arya could not have spoken if her life had hung on it. Calm as still water, she mouthed silently.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2919" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>恐慌如巨人的手攫住她的喉咙，艾莉亚知道自己命悬于此，不发出半点声音。止如水，她在心里默念。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2920');"><p>As Godwyn reached for her, Arya moved. Quick as a snake. She leaned to her left, letting his fingers brush her arm, spinning around him. Smooth as summer silk. By the time he got himself turned, she was sprinting down the alley. Swift as a deer. The septa was screeching at her. Arya slid between legs as thick and white as marble columns, bounded to her feet, bowled into Prince Tommen and hopped over him when he sat down hard and said "Oof," spun away from the second guard, and then she was past them all, running full out.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2920" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在高德温伸手的前一刻，艾莉亚采取了行动。迅如蛇。她重心左移，他的手指擦臂而过。她绕过他。柔如丝。待他转身，她已朝巷口飞奔而去。疾如鹿。修女朝她尖叫，艾莉亚从她两条粗得像白色大理石柱的腿中间钻过去，站起身，迎面撞上托曼王子，他“哎哟”一声重重坐倒。她从他身上跳过，闪开第二个侍卫，然后她便摆脱他们，全速逃走。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2921');"><p>She heard shouts, then pounding footsteps, closing behind her. She dropped and rolled. The red cloak went careening past her, stumbling. Arya sprang back to her feet. She saw a window above her, high and narrow, scarcely more than an arrow slit. Arya leapt, caught the sill, pulled herself up. She held her breath as she wriggled through. Slippery as an eel. Dropping to the floor in front of a startled scrubwoman, she hopped up, brushed the rushes off her clothes, and was off again, out the door and along a long hall, down a stair, across a hidden courtyard, around a corner and over a wall and through a low narrow window into a pitch-dark cellar. The sounds grew more and more distant behind her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2921" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她听见叫喊，紧接着是砰砰砰的脚步迅速朝她逼近。她身子一蹲，着地滚开。红衣卫士踉跄着冲过她身边，差点跌倒。艾莉亚一跃起身，看到头上有扇又高又窄的窗子，比城墙上的舐箭孔大不了多少，便向上一跳，攀住窗台，往上拉升，闭着气往里挤。滑如鳗。待她跳下窗口，正落在一名吃惊的洗衣妇面前，她立刻翻身，拍拍尘土，继续逃跑。她穿门而出，奔过长厅，跑下楼梯，穿越一座隐蔽的庭院，绕过转角，翻过墙，挤进一扇低矮窄窗后，来到一个伸手不见五指的漆黑地窖。身后追赶的声音渐渐变校
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2922');"><p>Arya was out of breath and quite thoroughly lost. She was in for it now if they had recognized her, but she didn’t think they had. She’d moved too fast. Swift as a deer.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2922" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚几乎喘不过气，完全迷失了方向。现在就算他们认出她，她也认栽了，但她觉得他们应该做不到，因为她动作太快了。疾如鹿。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2923');"><p>She hunkered down in the dark against a damp stone wall and listened for the pursuit, but the only sound was the beating of her own heart and a distant drip of water. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself. She wondered where she was. When they had first come to King’s Landing, she used to have bad dreams about getting lost in the castle. Father said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in her dreams it had been immense, an endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her. She would find herself wandering down gloomy halls past faded tapestries, descending endless circular stairs, darting through courtyards or over bridges, her shouts echoing unanswered. In some of the rooms the red stone walls would seem to drip blood, and nowhere could she find a window. Sometimes she would hear her father’s voice, but always from a long way off, and no matter how hard she ran after it, it would grow fainter and fainter, until it faded to nothing and Arya was alone in the dark.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2923" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她摸黑靠着一堵潮湿的石墙蹲下，静听追兵的响动，却只听见自己的心跳和远处的滴水声。静如影，她告诉自己。她纳闷自己究竟置身何处。初来君临时，她常做恶梦，梦见自己迷失在城堡里。父亲说红堡比临冬城要小，但在梦中它却硕大无比，活像一座无边无际的石造迷宫，而墙壁仿佛会在她身后变换形体。她发现自己常漫游在阴森的厅堂里，经过褪色的壁毡，走下无止尽的螺旋楼梯，在庭院间和吊桥上穿梭，尖声叫喊却无人回应。有些房间里，红墙似乎在滴血，而她一扇窗户也找不到。有的时候，她能听见父亲的声音，但总是从遥远的地方传来，而不论她如何努力地朝声音来源飞奔，那声音却依旧越来越微弱，直至完全消失。黑暗之中，只剩艾莉亚独自一人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2924');"><p>It was very dark right now, she realized. She hugged her bare knees tight against her chest and shivered. She would wait quietly and count to ten thousand. By then it would be safe for her to come creeping back out and find her way home.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2924" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她发觉这里也很暗，于是缩起裸露的膝盖，紧紧抱在胸前，发起抖来。她决定在这里默默数到一万，等那时候就可以安全地爬出去，找路回家了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2925');"><p>By the time she had reached eighty-seven, the room had begun to lighten as her eyes adjusted to the blackness. Slowly the shapes around her took on form. Huge empty eyes stared at her hungrily through the gloom, and dimly she saw the jagged shadows of long teeth. She had lost the count. She closed her eyes and bit her lip and sent the fear away. When she looked again, the monsters would be gone. Would never have been. She pretended that Syrio was beside her in the dark, whispering in her ear. Calm as still water, she told herself. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. She opened her eyes again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2925" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>当她数到八十七的时候，眼睛已经习惯了黑暗，房间也似乎逐渐亮起来，身边的事物缓缓现形。昏暗之中，无数巨大而空洞的眼睛饥渴地瞪着她。她隐约看到长牙的锯齿阴影。她顿时忘了数到哪里，只敢闭上眼睛，咬住嘴唇，驱赶恐惧。等她睁眼再看，怪兽就会不见。怪兽会不存在。她假装西利欧也在黑暗中，陪在她身边，对她悄声说话。止如水，她告诉自己，壮如熊，猛如狼，然后睁开眼睛。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2926');"><p>The monsters were still there, but the fear was gone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2926" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>怪兽还在，恐惧却消失了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2927');"><p>Arya got to her feet, moving warily. The heads were all around her. She touched one, curious, wondering if it was real. Her fingertips brushed a massive jaw. It felt real enough. The bone was smooth beneath her hand, cold and hard to the touch. She ran her fingers down a tooth, black and sharp, a dagger made of darkness. It made her shiver.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2927" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚小心翼翼地站起来。四周都是头骨，她好奇地摸摸其中一个，不知到底是不是真的。她的指尖拂过一个宽大的下巴，摸起来挺像真的。骨头的感觉很平滑，既冷且硬。她的手指摸到一颗牙齿，又黑又尖，活像是由黑暗所造的匕首，她不禁打了个寒颤。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2928');"><p>"It’s dead," she said aloud. "It’s just a skull, it can’t hurt me." Yet somehow the monster seemed to know she was there. She could feel its empty eyes watching her through the gloom, and there was something in that dim, cavernous room that did not love her. She edged away from the skull and backed into a second, larger than the first. For an instant she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder, as if it wanted a bite of her flesh. Arya whirled, felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang nipped at her jerkin, and then she was running. Another skull loomed ahead, the biggest monster of all, but Arya did not even slow. She leapt over a ridge of black teeth as tall as swords, dashed through hungry jaws, and threw herself against the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2928" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“它死了。”她朗声道，“只是颗骷髅头，伤不了我的。”但不知怎的，那怪兽似乎知道她在这儿。她感觉得到它空洞的眼睛穿过阴暗看着她，在这个光线微弱、宽敞高大的房间里，有种不喜欢她的东西存在。她避开那个头颅，向后退开，却又碰到一个更大的骷髅。一时间她几乎可以感觉它的牙齿陷进她的肩膀，仿佛想一口咬下她的血肉。艾莉亚旋身，一颗尖牙果然已经咬住她的外衣，皮革被钩住，撕裂了一大块，她没命似的快跑。眼前又有一个头颅出现，这是最大的怪兽。艾莉亚不敢慢步，她跳过一排高得像剑、山脊似的黑牙齿，冲进一个又一个饥饿的血盆大口，然后撞上了门。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2929');"><p>Her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood, and she yanked at it. The door resisted a moment, before it slowly began to swing inward, with a creak so loud Arya was certain it could be heard all through the city. She opened the door just far enough to slip through, into the hallway beyond.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2929" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她摸黑找到木门上厚重的铁环，使劲一拉，门抗拒了一会儿，方才缓缓向内打开，可是发出来的嘎吱声却大得吓人，艾莉亚心想这下全城的人都会听见了。她拉开恰好能让自己钻进去的缝隙，溜进门后的长厅。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2930');"><p>If the room with the monsters had been dark, the hall was the blackest pit in the seven hells. Calm as still water, Arya told herself, but even when she gave her eyes a moment to adjust, there was nothing to see but the vague grey outline of the door she had come through. She wiggled her fingers in front of her face, felt the air move, saw nothing. She was blind. A water dancer sees with all her senses, she reminded herself. She closed her eyes and steadied her breathing one two three, drank in the quiet, reached out with her hands.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2930" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>如果刚刚那个充满怪兽的房间算得上黑暗，那这个大厅就是七层地狱里最伸手不见五指的黑洞。止如水，艾莉亚告诉自己，她给了眼睛足够的调适时间，但除了刚才进来的门有模糊的灰色轮廓，其余依旧什么也看不到。她伸出手指在面前摇晃，感觉到空气的移动，却没有东西。她成了瞎子。水舞者要用所有的感官去洞察周围，她提醒自己。于是她闭上眼，稳住呼吸数了一二三，静静吸口气，然后伸出双手，开始摸索。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2931');"><p>Her fingers brushed against rough unfinished stone to her left. She followed the wall, her hand skimming along the surface, taking small gliding steps through the darkness. All halls lead somewhere. Where there is a way in, there is a way out. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Arya would not be afraid. It seemed as if she had been walking a long ways when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew past her cheek. Loose hairs stirred faintly against her skin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2931" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>左手边，她的指头拂过未完工的粗石表面。她便沿着墙走，手在石面游移，踏着小碎步慢慢穿越黑暗。每个房间总有出路，有进必有出嘛。而且，恐惧比利剑更伤人。艾莉亚不能害怕。她仿佛走了好长一段，墙壁突然到了尽头，一团冷气吹过她的脸颊。松开的头发轻轻拍打着她的皮肤。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2932');"><p>From somewhere far below her, she heard noises. The scrape of boots, the distant sound of voices. A flickering light brushed the wall ever so faintly, and she saw that she stood at the top of a great black well, a shaft twenty feet across plunging deep into the earth. Huge stones had been set into the curving walls as steps, circling down and down, dark as the steps to hell that Old Nan used to tell them of. And something was coming up out of the darkness, out of the bowels of the earth?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_2932" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她听见有声音从下方很远的地方传来。靴子的磨地声，遥远的交谈声。摇曳的火光朦胧地扫过墙壁，她这才发现自己正站在一口大黑井边，井足足有二十尺宽，开口直向地心。弯曲的墙上嵌了大石头作为楼梯，向下回旋回旋，漆黑得就像老奶妈以前常跟他们说的，通往地狱的阶梯。有东西正从黑暗中爬出来，从地心深处爬出来……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2933');"><p>Arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face. Far below, she saw the light of a single torch, small as the flame of a candle. Two men, she made out. Their shadows writhed against the sides of the well, tall as giants. She could hear their voices, echoing up the shaft.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2933" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>艾莉亚趴在井边偷偷往下看，一股冰冷的黑气迎面袭来。下方极远处，她看到一根火把的亮光，微小有如烛火。她分辨出是两个人，他们的影子交错投舐在墙上，高大有如巨人。她听见他们的声音，回荡着传向井边。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2934');"><p>"?.?.?.?found one bastard," one said. "The rest will come soon. A day, two days, a fortnight?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2934" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“……找到了一个私生子，”一个人说，“其他的也迟早会查出来。要么一两天，最迟不过两星期……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2935');"><p>"And when he learns the truth, what will he do?" a second voice asked in the liquid accents of the Free Cities.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2935" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“等他查出真相，他会怎么做？”第二个声音是自由贸易城邦的滑溜口音。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2936');"><p>"The gods alone know," the first voice said. Arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting up off the torch, writhing like a snake as it rose. "The fools tried to kill his son, and what’s worse, they made a mummer’s farce of it. He’s not a man to put that aside. I warn you, the wolf and lion will soon be at each other’s throats, whether we will it or no."

An instant later the man holding the torch climbed into her sight, his companion beside him. Arya crept back away from the well, dropped to her stomach, and flattened herself against the wall. She held her breath as the men reached the top of the steps.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2940');"><p>"What would you have me do?" asked the torchbearer, a stout man in a leather half cape. Even in heavy boots, his feet seemed to glide soundlessly over the ground. A round scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his steel cap, and he wore mail over boiled leather, and a dirk and shortsword at his belt. It seemed to Arya there was something oddly familiar about him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2940" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你要我怎么办？”拿火把的人问。他是个身材粗壮的人，披着皮臸的半身斗篷。虽然穿了厚重靴子，他的脚却仿佛无声地滑过路面。在他的钢头盔下，是张带伤疤的圆脸，还有撮短须。他穿着硬皮衣，外罩盔甲，腰间则系了一把匕首和一柄短剑。艾莉亚觉得他有种古怪的熟悉感。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2941');"><p>"If one Hand can die, why not a second?" replied the man with the accent and the forked yellow beard. "You have danced the dance before, my friend." He was no one Arya had ever seen before, she was certain of it. Grossly fat, yet he seemed to walk lightly, carrying his weight on the balls of his feet as a water dancer might. His rings glimmered in the torchlight, red-gold and pale silver, crusted with rubies, sapphires, slitted yellow tiger eyes. Every finger wore a ring; some had two.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2942');"><p>"Before is not now, and this Hand is not the other," the scarred man said as they stepped out into the hall.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2943');"><p>"Perhaps so," the forked beard replied, pausing to catch his breath after the long climb. "Nonetheless, we must have time.

A huge slab of rock, red in the torchlight, slid down out of the ceiling with a resounding crash that almost made her cry out.

The Knight of Flowers writes Highgarden, urging his lord father to send his sister to court. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and beautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed her, wed her, and make a new queen. Littlefinger?.?.?.?the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing. Yet Lord Stark’s the one who troubles my sleep. He has the bastard, he has the book, and soon enough he’ll have the truth. And now his wife has abducted Tyrion Lannister, thanks to Littlefinger’s meddling. Lord Tywin will take that for an outrage, and Jaime has a queer affection for the Imp. If the Lannisters move north, that will bring the Tullys in as well. Delay, you say. Make haste, I reply. Even the finest of jugglers cannot keep a hundred balls in the air forever."

It was full dark when finally Arya emerged into the night air.

She stank so badly that she stripped right there, dropping her soiled clothing on the riverbank as she dove into the deep black waters. She swam until she felt clean, and crawled out shivering.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2984');"><p>"No one sent me, m’lord, saving old Mormont. I’m here to find men for the Wall, and when Robert next holds court, I’ll bend the knee and cry our need, see if the king and his Hand have some scum in the dungeons they’d be well rid of. You might say as Benjen Stark is why we’re talking, though. His blood ran black. Made him my brother as much as yours. It’s for his sake I’m come. Rode hard, I did, near killed my horse the way I drove her, but I left the others well behind."

The scent of blood or the scent of gold, they smell the same in the end. Not all o’ them made for King’s Landing, either. Some went galloping for Casterly Rock, and the Rock lies closer. Lord Tywin will have gotten the word by now, you can count on it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2986" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>尤伦吐了口口水。“还不就是流浪武士、自由骑手这路货色。整间旅店都是这号人，我看他们是嗅到了好味道。血和黄金的味道，这类人到死都追逐不放。他们没有都往君临来，有些朝凯岩城冲去，而凯岩城比较近，可以想见，如今泰温大人肯定得到了消息。”
