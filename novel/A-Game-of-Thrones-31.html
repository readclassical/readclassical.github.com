</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2633');"><p>I stood last vigil for him myself," Ser Barristan Selmy said as they looked down at the body in the back of the cart. "He had no one else. A mother in the Vale, I am told."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2633" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“昨晚是我亲自替他守的灵，”巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士道，他们看着推车后面载着的遗体。 “这孩子无依无靠，连个亲朋好友都没有，听说就只有艾林谷家里的母亲。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2634');"><p>In the pale dawn light, the young knight looked as though he were sleeping. He had not been handsome, but death had smoothed his rough-hewn features and the silent sisters had dressed him in his best velvet tunic, with a high collar to cover the ruin the lance had made of his throat. Eddard Stark looked at his face, and wondered if it had been for his sake that the boy had died. Slain by a Lannister bannerman before Ned could speak to him; could that be mere happenstance? He supposed he would never know.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2634" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>苍白的晨光中，年轻骑士看上去仿佛正在沉睡。他算不上英俊，但死亡抚平了他粗糙的面容，静默修女会的姐妹则为他穿上了料子最好的天鹅绒外衣，高高的领口恰好遮住喉咙上被长枪戳出的大洞。艾德•史塔克看着他的脸，暗忖这男孩不知是否因为自己而丢了性命。 奈德还不及和他谈谈，他便死于兰尼斯特封臣枪下。这真的只是巧合？他大概永远不会知道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2635');"><p>"Hugh was Jon Arryn’s squire for four years," Selmy went on. "The king knighted him before he rode north, in Jon’s memory. The lad wanted it desperately, yet I fear he was not ready."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2635" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“修夫在琼恩•艾林身边当了四年的侍从，”赛尔弥继续说，“国王为了纪念琼恩，在北行前封他做了骑士。这孩子想当骑士想得不行，只可惜他恐怕还没准备好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2636');"><p>Ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years. "None of us is ever ready," he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2636" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德昨晚睡得很差，现在的他和身边的老人一样疲累。“我们不也一样？”他说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2637');"><p>"For knighthood?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2637" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们也没准备好当骑士？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2638');"><p>"For death." Gently Ned covered the boy with his cloak, a bloodstained bit of blue bordered in crescent moons. When his mother asked why her son was dead, he reflected bitterly, they would tell her he had fought to honor the King’s Hand, Eddard Stark. "This was needless. War should not be a game." Ned turned to the woman beside the cart, shrouded in grey, face hidden but for her eyes. The silent sisters prepared men for the grave, and it was ill fortune to look on the face of death. "Send his armor home to the Vale. The mother will want to have it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2638" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没准备好面对死亡”. 奈德轻轻地为那孩子盖上他绣着弯月的染血蓝披风。当他的母亲问起儿子死因时，他苦涩地想，他们会说他是为了首相的荣誉而献身。“他根本不该送命。战争岂是儿戏？”奈德转身面对站在推车边的灰衣女人，她全身上下包裹得严严实实，脸上只露出眼睛。静默姐妹专门处理死者后事，而见着死亡的面容是不吉利的事。“把他的盔甲也送回艾林谷家里去，让母亲留作纪念吧。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2639');"><p>"It is worth a fair piece of silver," Ser Barristan said. "The boy had it forged special for the tourney. Plain work, but good. I do not know if he had finished paying the smith."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2639" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这东西值不少钱，”巴利斯坦爵士道，“这孩子是特别为了比武会订做的。不花俏，但实在，不知道他付清铁匠的钱没有。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2640');"><p>"He paid yesterday, my lord, and he paid dearly," Ned replied. And to the silent sister he said, "Send the mother the armor. I will deal with this smith." She bowed her head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2640" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他昨天已经付出惨痛的代价了。”奈德回答，接着他对静默姐妹说，“把盔甲送给他母亲。铁匠这边我会处理。”她点点头。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2641');"><p>Afterward Ser Barristan walked with Ned to the king’s pavilion. The camp was beginning to stir. Fat sausages sizzled and spit over firepits, spicing the air with the scents of garlic and pepper. Young squires hurried about on errands as their masters woke, yawning and stretching, to meet the day. A serving man with a goose under his arm bent his knee when he caught sight of them. "M’lords," he muttered as the goose honked and pecked at his fingers. The shields displayed outside each tent heralded its occupant: the silver eagle of Seagard, Bryce Caron’s field of nightingales, a cluster of grapes for the Redwynes, brindled boar, red ox, burning tree, white ram, triple spiral, purple unicorn, dancing maiden, blackadder, twin towers, horned owl, and last the pure white blazons of the Kingsguard, shining like the dawn.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2641" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>随后巴利斯坦爵士陪着奈德走向国王的帐篷。营地正在恢复生气，肥美的烤香肠在火堆上嘶嘶作响，滴着油汁，空气中充满蒜头和胡椒的香味。年轻侍从跑来跑去，而他们的主子刚刚睡醒，打着呵欠伸着懒腰，准备迎接新的一天。一个腋下夹了只鹅的厨子看见他们赶忙单膝跪下。 “大人您们早。”他喃喃道，鹅嘎嘎叫着啄他手指。陈列在每个帐篷外的盾牌刻画着居住其中的贵族家徽，有海疆城的银色飞鹰，布莱斯•卡伦的夜莺与田野，雷德温家族的葡萄串，还有花斑野猪、红色公牛、燃烧之树、白色公羊、三重螺旋、紫色独角兽、跳舞少女、黑蛇、双塔、长角猫头鹰，最后是御林铁卫如黎明般闪亮的纯白纹章。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2642');"><p>"The king means to fight in the melee today," Ser Barristan said as they were passing Ser Meryn’s shield, its paint sullied by a deep gash where Loras Tyrell’s lance had scarred the wood as he drove him from his saddle.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2642" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“国王打算今天参加团体比武，”他们经过马林爵士的盾牌时，巴利斯坦说。盾牌上的漆被刮了深深的一划，正是昨天洛拉斯•提利尔将他刺下马时留的印记。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2643');"><p>"Yes," Ned said grimly. Jory had woken him last night to bring him that news. Small wonder he had slept so badly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2643" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是啊。”奈德表情凝重地说。乔里昨天夜里把他叫醒，向他通报了这个消息，难怪他睡不好。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2644');"><p>Ser Barristan’s look was troubled. "They say night’s beauties fade at dawn, and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2644" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>巴利斯坦爵士一脸愁容。“俗话说天亮后黑夜的美要消散，酒醒后说过的话就不算。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2645');"><p>"They say so," Ned agreed, "but not of Robert." Other men might reconsider words spoken in drunken bravado, but Robert Baratheon would remember and, remembering, would never back down.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2645" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“话是这么说，”奈德同意，“但对劳勃没用。”换做其他人，或许还会重新考虑酒后许下的豪言壮语，可劳勃•拜拉席恩会记得牢牢的，而且绝不反悔。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2646');"><p>The king’s pavilion was close by the water, and the morning mists off the river had wreathed it in wisps of grey. It was all of golden silk, the largest and grandest structure in the camp. Outside the entrance, Robert’s warhammer was displayed beside an immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of House Baratheon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2646" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王的营帐靠近水滨，包围在灰色的河面晨雾里。帐篷用金丝织成，乃是整个营地里最大也最华丽的建筑。劳勃的战锤和一面巨大的铁盾放在入口外，盾牌上纹饰着拜拉席恩家族的宝冠雄鹿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2647');"><p>Ned had hoped to discover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep, but luck was not with him. They found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his displeasure at two young squires who were trying to buckle him into his armor. "Your Grace," one was saying, almost in tears, "it’s made too small, it won’t go." He fumbled, and the gorget he was trying to fit around Robert’s thick neck tumbled to the ground.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2647" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德原本希望国王宿醉未醒，一切便迎刃而解，可惜他们运气不好，正碰上用光滑角臸酒杯喝啤酒的劳勃，他还一边对两个手忙脚乱替他穿铠甲的年轻侍从大呼小叫。“国王陛下，”其中一个眼泪都快掉下来了。“这铠甲太小，穿不上的。”他手一滑，原本正试着要套进劳勃粗脖子的颈甲便摔到地上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2648');"><p>"Seven hells!" Robert swore. "Do I have to do it myself? Piss on the both of you. Pick it up. Don’t just stand there gaping, Lancel, pick it up!" The lad jumped, and the king noticed his company. "Look at these oafs, Ned. My wife insisted I take these two to squire for me, and they’re worse than useless. Can’t even put a man’s armor on him properly. Squires, they say. I say they’re swineherds dressed up in silk."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2648" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“七层地狱啊！”劳勃咒骂，“难道我非得亲自动手不可？你两个都是他妈的饭桶。把东西捡起来，不要光张着嘴呆在那儿。蓝赛尔，快给我捡起来！”那小伙子吓得跳将起来，国王这才注意到新来的访客。“奈德，快瞧瞧这些笨蛋。我老婆坚持要我收他们当侍从，结果他们比废物还不如。连帮人穿铠甲都不会，这算哪门子侍从，这叫穿了衣服的猪头。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2649');"><p>Ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty. "The boys are not at fault," he told the king. "You’re too fat for your armor, Robert."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2649" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德只需一眼便看出问题所在。“这不是他们的错，”他告诉国王，“劳勃，是你太胖了，这才穿不下。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2650');"><p>Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer, tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and said darkly, "Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your king?" He let go his laughter, sudden as a storm. "Ah, damn you, Ned, why are you always right?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2650" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃•拜拉席恩灌了一大口啤酒，把空角杯扔到兽皮睡铺上，用手背抹抹嘴，然后阴阴地说：“太胖？太胖，是吗？你对国王是这样讲话的吗？”突然他像暴风来袭一样哈哈大笑。“啊，去你的，奈德，为什么你说的永远都没错？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2651');"><p>The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them. "You. Yes, both of you. You heard the Hand. The king is too fat for his armor. Go find Ser Aron Santagar. Tell him I need the breastplate stretcher. Now! What are you waiting for?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2651" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>两个侍从露出紧张的微笑，国王又转向他们。“你们，对，你们两个，听见首相说的话了吗？国王太胖了，所以穿不下铠甲。去把艾伦•桑塔加爵士找来，跟他说我需要撑开胸甲的钳子。快去啊！还等什么？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2652');"><p>The boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the tent. Robert managed to keep a stern face until they were gone. Then he dropped back into a chair, shaking with laughter.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2652" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>男孩们慌忙跑出帐篷，途中还互相绊了一跤。劳勃装出一副严峻的表情直到他们离开，然后轰地坐回椅子，大笑不已。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2653');"><p>Ser Barristan Selmy chuckled with him. Even Eddard Stark managed a smile. Always, though, the graver thoughts crept in. He could not help taking note of the two squires: handsome boys, fair and well made. One was Sansa’s age, with long golden curls; the other perhaps fifteen, sandy-haired, with a wisp of a mustache and the emerald-green eyes of the queen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2653" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士跟着呵呵笑了，就连艾德•史塔克也露出了微笑。然而，他没法不在意那两个侍僮：他们都是漂亮小伙子，皮肤白晰，体态匀称。生着金色卷发的那个年纪和珊莎差不多，另外那个约莫十五，黄棕色头发，一点小胡子，有着和王后一样的翡翠绿眸。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2654');"><p>"Ah, I wish I could be there to see Santagar’s face," Robert said. "I hope he’ll have the wit to send them to someone else. We ought to keep them running all day!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2654" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊，我真想瞧瞧桑塔加听了脸上是什么表情”.劳勃道，“他如果有点脑子，就会支他们去找别人。我们就让他俩成天跑个没完！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2655');"><p>"Those boys," Ned asked him. "Lannisters?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2655" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这两个小伙子，”奈德问他，“是兰尼斯特家的人？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2656');"><p>Robert nodded, wiping tears from his eyes. "Cousins. Sons of Lord Tywin’s brother. One of the dead ones. Or perhaps the live one, now that I come to think on it. I don’t recall. My wife comes from a very large family, Ned."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2656" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃点头，一边擦掉笑出的眼泪。“她的两个堂弟，泰温大人他老弟的儿子，那些个死掉的老弟，我想想，又好像是活着的那个，我不记得了。奈德，我老婆来自一个很大的家族。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2657');"><p>A very ambitious family, Ned thought. He had nothing against the squires, but it troubled him to see Robert surrounded by the queen’s kin, waking and sleeping. The Lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know no bounds. "The talk is you and the queen had angry words last night."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2657" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>也是一个野心勃勃的家族，奈德心想。他对这两个侍从本身并无意见，但看到劳勃身边日夜都是王后的亲戚，却不免担心。兰尼斯特家对权位和荣耀真是贪得无厌。“听说您昨晚和王后闹不愉快了？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2658');"><p>The mirth curdled on Robert’s face. "The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee. She’s sulking in the castle now, damn her. Your sister would never have shamed me like that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2658" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃脸上的欢乐顿时结冻。“那死女人想阻止我参加今天的团体比武，这会儿她还窝在城堡里生闷气，气死算了。你妹妹绝不会这样羞辱我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2659');"><p>"You never knew Lyanna as I did, Robert," Ned told him. "You saw her beauty, but not the iron underneath. She would have told you that you have no business in the melee."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2659" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃，你对莱安娜的了解没我深，”奈德告诉他，“你只见到她的美，却不知道她真正的硬脾气。倘若她还活着，她会告诉你，你和团体比武毫无瓜葛。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2660');"><p>"You too?" The king frowned. "You are a sour man, Stark. Too long in the north, all the juices have frozen inside you. Well, mine are still running." He slapped his chest to prove it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2660" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“怎么你也来这套？”国王皱眉，“史塔克，你这家伙真讨厌，我看你在北方待得太久，体内的血都冻成冰啦。告诉你，老子可还热血沸腾哩。”他拍拍胸脯以示证明。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2661');"><p>"You are the king," Ned reminded him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2661" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别忘了你是国王。”奈德提醒他。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2662');"><p>"I sit on the damn iron seat when I must. Does that mean I don’t have the same hungers as other men? A bit of wine now and again, a girl squealing in bed, the feel of a horse between my legs? Seven hells, Ned, I want to hit someone."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2662" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我该坐的时候坐坐那张该死的铁椅子，难道就不能跟其他人一样有七情六欲吗？难道我不能没事喝点小酒，找个女孩乐一乐，享受骑马的快感吗？下七层地狱去，奈德，我不过是想打打人罢了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2663');"><p>Ser Barristan Selmy spoke up. "Your Grace," he said, "it is not seemly that the king should ride into the melee. It would not be a fair contest. Who would dare strike you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2663" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士开了口：“陛下，”他说，“国王加入团体比武并不恰当，因为这样一来，比赛就不公平了。试问谁敢对您动手呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2664');"><p>Robert seemed honestly taken aback. "Why, all of them, damn it. If they can. And the last man left standing?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2664" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃真是没料到这层。“唉，谁都行啊，他妈的。只要他们有那能耐。反正最后站着的……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2665');"><p>"?.?.?.?will be you," Ned finished. He saw at once that Selmy had hit the mark. The dangers of the melee were only a savor to Robert, but this touched on his pride. "Ser Barristan is right. There’s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by hurting you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2665" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一定会是您。”奈德接口。他立刻发现赛尔弥点到了关键。若是强调比武的危险，只会更刺激劳勃，而这样说来便事关他的自尊。“巴利斯坦爵士说得没错，七国上下绝没有人敢冒着惹您生气的危险对您动手。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2666');"><p>The king rose to his feet, his face flushed. "Are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2666" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>国王满脸通红，霍地站起，“你的意思是那些没用的胆小鬼会故意失手？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2667');"><p>"For a certainty," Ned said, and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed his head in silent accord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2667" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可想而知。”奈德道。巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士静静地点头同意。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2668');"><p>For a moment Robert was so angry he could not speak. He strode across the tent, whirled, strode back, his face dark and angry. He snatched up his breastplate from the ground and threw it at Barristan Selmy in a wordless fury. Selmy dodged. "Get out," the king said then, coldly. "Get out before I kill you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2668" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>有好一阵子，劳勃气得说不出话。他从帐篷的这边走到那边，旋身，又走回来，一脸阴沉的怒气。随即他从地上抓起胸甲，气冲冲地朝巴利斯坦掷去。赛尔弥躲开了。“出去，”这时国王才冷冷地发话，“免得我宰了你。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2669');"><p>Ser Barristan left quickly. Ned was about to follow when the king called out again. "Not you, Ned."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2669" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>巴利斯坦爵士立刻离开，奈德正准备跟进，国王却又叫道：“奈德，你不用走。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2670');"><p>Ned turned back. Robert took up his horn again, filled it with beer from a barrel in the corner, and thrust it at Ned. "Drink," he said brusquely.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2670" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德转身，只见劳勃再度拿起他的角杯，从角落里的酒桶装满啤酒，然后塞给奈德。“喝吧。”他唐突地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2671');"><p>"I’ve no thirst..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2671" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不渴——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2672');"><p>"Drink. Your king commands it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2672" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“快喝。这是国王的命令。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2673');"><p>Ned took the horn and drank. The beer was black and thick, so strong it stung the eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2673" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>于是奈德接过角杯喝了下去，啤酒又黑又浓，浓烈得令眼睛刺痛。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2674');"><p>Robert sat down again. "Damn you, Ned Stark. You and Jon Arryn, I loved you both. What have you done to me? You were the one should have been king, you or Jon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2674" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>劳勃又坐下来。“去你的，奈德•史塔克。你和琼恩•艾林，我这么爱你们，结果你们是怎么对我的？你或琼恩才应该来当国王。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2675');"><p>"You had the better claim, Your Grace."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2675" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“陛下，您名正言顺，最有资格称王。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2676');"><p>"I told you to drink, not to argue. You made me king, you could at least have the courtesy to listen when I talk, damn you. Look at me, Ned. Look at what kinging has done to me. Gods, too fat for my armor, how did it ever come to this?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2676" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我叫你喝酒，没叫你顶嘴。妈的，你既然让我做了国王，好歹我说话的时候专心听行吧。奈德，你看看我，看看我当了国王之后变成什么样子。诸神在上，我竟然胖得穿不下自己的铠甲，怎么会搞成这样？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2677');"><p>"Robert?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2677" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2678');"><p>"Drink and stay quiet, the king is talking. I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I’ve won it. And Cersei?.?.?.?I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me, but Jon said the realm needed an heir. Cersei Lannister would be a good match, he told me, she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father’s throne." The king shook his head. "I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy. Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but cold?.?.?.?the way she guards her cunt, you’d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs. Here, give me that beer if you won’t drink it." He took the horn, upended it, belched, wiped his mouth. "I am sorry for your girl, Ned. Truly. About the wolf, I mean. My son was lying, I’d stake my soul on it. My son?.?.?.?you love your children, don’t you?"

And there had been a sister who had died young under queer circumstances, and the fire that had disfigured his brother, and the hunting accident that had killed their father.

</p></origin><translate id="div_2765" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哦，是嘛？这我承认。不过就算我说了又如何，好让您立刻冲到国王面前向他禀报，是不是？等劳勃听说了这些诡计他又会怎么做呢？我倒是挺好奇。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2766');"><p>Ned considered that. "He would have damned them all, and fought anyway, to show he did not fear them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2766" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德仔细想想。“他会咒他们通通滚蛋，然后照样参赛，让他们知道他不怕。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2767');"><p>Varys spread his hands. "I will make another confession, Lord Eddard. I was curious to see what you would do. Why not come to me? you ask, and I must answer, Why, because I did not trust you, my lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2767" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>瓦里斯一摊手：“艾德大人，我再向您承认一件事吧。我想看看您听了会有何反应。您问我怎么不事先跟您说，我的回答是：因为我不信任您，大人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2768');"><p>"You did not trust me?" Ned was frankly astonished.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2768" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你不信任我？”这次奈德真的大吃一惊。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2769');"><p>"The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people, Lord Eddard," Varys said. "Those who are loyal to the realm, and those who are loyal only to themselves. Until this morning, I could not say which you might be?.?.?.?so I waited to see?.?.?.?and now I know, for a certainty." He smiled a plump tight little smile, and for a moment his private face and public mask were one. "I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so much. Oh, yes I do."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2769" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“艾德大人，红堡里住了两种人。”瓦里斯道，“一种忠于王国，一种忠于自己。今天早上以前，我不敢判定您属于哪一种……所以我等着瞧……现在我清清楚楚地知道了。”他浅浅一笑，刹那间他私下的表情和在公众场合的表情合而为一。“我渐渐开始了解王后为何这么怕您了。呵，我总算见识到了。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2770');"><p>"You are the one she ought to fear," Ned said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2770" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你才是她应该怕的人。”奈德道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2771');"><p>"No. I am what I am. The king makes use of me, but it shames him. A most puissant warrior is our Robert, and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and spies and eunuchs. If a day should come when Cersei whispers, ‘Kill that man,’ Ilyn Payne will snick my head off in a twinkling, and who will mourn poor Varys then? North or south, they sing no songs for spiders." He reached out and touched Ned with a soft hand. "But you, Lord Stark?.?.?.?I think?.?.?.?no, I know?.?.?.?he would not kill you, not even for his queen, and there may lie our salvation."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2771" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，我的身份很清楚。国王利用我，但他为此感到羞耻。咱们劳勃是个雄赳赳气昂昂的大勇士，这种男子气概的人最不屑的就是鸡鸣狗盗和太监之流。要是哪天瑟曦在他耳边嘀咕说‘把他杀了吧’，伊林•派恩转眼间就会砍了我这颗头，到时候谁会替可怜的瓦里斯哀伤呢？天南地北，没有人会为蜘蛛歌唱啊。”他伸出软绵绵的手碰碰奈德。“可史塔克大人您就不一样了……我猜想……不，我很清楚……他决不会杀您，即使是为了王后，这或许便是我们的救赎所在哟。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2772');"><p>It was all too much. For a moment Eddard Stark wanted nothing so much as to return to Winterfell, to the clean simplicity of the north, where the enemies were winter and the wildlings beyond the Wall. "Surely Robert has other loyal friends," he protested. "His brothers, his..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2772" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这真是太过火了。有好一会儿艾德•史塔克只想回到临冬城，只想要北方的简单明了，那里的敌人就是寒冬和长城外的野人。“劳勃一定还有其他值得信赖的盟友，”他辩驳道，“比如他亲弟弟，还有他——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2773');"><p>"...wife?" Varys finished, with a smile that cut. "His brothers hate the Lannisters, true enough, but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing, are they? Ser Barristan loves his honor, Grand Maester Pycelle loves his office, and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2773" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“——他老婆？”瓦里斯替他说完，同时露出锐利伤人的微笑。“他两个弟弟是痛恨兰尼斯特没错，但恨王后和爱国王不见得是同一回事，您说是罢？巴利斯坦爵士爱的是他的荣誉，派席尔国师爱惜他得来不易的职位，小指头呢，小指头只爱小指头他自己。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2774');"><p>"The Kingsguard..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2774" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那御林铁卫——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2775');"><p>"A paper shield," the eunuch said. "Try not to look so shocked, Lord Stark. Jaime Lannister is himself a Sworn Brother of the White Swords, and we all know what his oath is worth. The days when men like Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight wore the white cloak are gone to dust and song. Of these seven, only Ser Barristan Selmy is made of the true steel, and Selmy is old. Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are the queen’s creatures to the bone, and I have deep suspicions of the others. No, my lord, when the swords come out in earnest, you will be the only true friend Robert Baratheon will have."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2775" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不过是纸老虎罢了，”太监说，“史塔克大人，您就别一副震惊的模样了。詹姆•兰尼斯特固然是个宣过誓的白骑士，但我们都知道他发的誓有几分斤两。莱安•雷德温和龙骑士伊蒙王子披白袍的日子早过去啦。如今的七铁卫里，只有巴利斯坦•赛尔弥爵士有真本领，然而赛尔弥老矣。柏洛斯爵士和马林爵士都是王后死心塌地的走狗，另外几个我看也好不到哪里去。是的，大人，若真要动刀动枪，您将会是劳勃•拜拉席恩惟一的朋友。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2776');"><p>"Robert must be told," Ned said. "If what you say is true, if even a part of it is true, the king must hear it for himself."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2776" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我得让劳勃知道，”奈德道，“假如你所言非虚，即便只有一半属实，国王本人都应该立刻知情。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2777');"><p>"And what proof shall we lay before him? My words against theirs? My little birds against the queen and the Kingslayer, against his brothers and his council, against the Wardens of East and West, against all the might of Casterly Rock? Pray, send for Ser Ilyn directly, it will save us all some time. I know where that road ends."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2777" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那请问咱们的证据何在？难道要我和他们当面对臼？要我的小小鸟儿与王后、弑君者，与国王的亲弟弟和他满朝重臣，东西境守护，以及凯岩城所有的势力为敌？您干脆直接叫伊林爵士来砍我头吧，那样比较省事。我知道说了会有什么下场。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2778');"><p>"Yet if what you say is true, they will only bide their time and make another attempt."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2778" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“若你所言属实，他们只会静待时机，准备再次发难。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2779');"><p>"Indeed they will," said Varys, "and sooner rather than later, I do fear. You are making them most anxious, Lord Eddard. But my little birds will be listening, and together we may be able to forestall them, you and I." He rose and pulled up his cowl so his face was hidden once more. "Thank you for the wine. We will speak again. When you see me next at council, be certain to treat me with your accustomed contempt. You should not find it difficult."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2779" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那还用说，”瓦里斯道，“只怕会很快。艾德大人，您让他们寝食难安哪。但我的小小鸟儿会仔细倾听，咱们俩联手，或许能洞烛先机，就你我两个。”他站起身，拉上斗篷遮住脸。“谢谢您的酒，今天就到此为止，其他以后再谈。下次您在朝廷里见到我，请千万别忘了用上您以前那种轻蔑的态度。我想这应该很容易。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2780');"><p>He was at the door when Ned called, "Varys." The eunuch turned back. "How did Jon Arryn die?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2780" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他走到门边时，奈德叫道：“瓦里斯，”太监回过头。“琼恩•艾林是怎么死的？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2781');"><p>"I wondered when you would get around to that."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2781" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我还在想你什么时候才会问起这个。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2782');"><p>"Tell me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2782" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“告诉我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2783');"><p>"The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, clear and sweet as water, and it leaves no trace. I begged Lord Arryn to use a taster, in this very room I begged him, but he would not hear of it. Only one who was less than a man would even think of such a thing, he told me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2783" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那东西叫‘里斯之泪’，非常罕见，价格高昂。其味道清甜如水，不留一点痕迹。当时我就在这个房间里恳求艾林大人叫人先尝过食物，自己再吃，可他不肯听，还告诉我：只有不配做人的东西才会想到这种事。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2784');"><p>Ned had to know the rest. "Who gave him the poison?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2784" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德急切地想知道事情始末。“谁下的毒？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2785');"><p>"Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him, no doubt. Oh, but which one? There were many such. Lord Arryn was a kindly, trusting man." The eunuch sighed. "There was one boy. All he was, he owed Jon Arryn, but when the widow fled to the Eyrie with her household, he stayed in King’s Landing and prospered. It always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world." The whip was in his voice again, every word a stroke. "He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney, him in his bright new armor, with those crescent moons on his cloak. A pity he died so untimely, before you could talk to him?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2785" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“显然是某个与他很亲近，常和他一起同桌共餐的朋友，噢，但是哪一个呢？可疑的对象太多了。艾林大人是个和蔼可亲又值得信赖的人哪。”太监叹道：“不过倒确有这么个孩子，他的一切都是琼恩•艾林给的，但当艾林的寡妇带着一家大小逃回鹰巢城时，他却选择了留在君临，并很快飞黄腾达。看到年轻人有发展，我总是高兴的。”他的话锋重归锐利，每个字都像挥出的一鞭。“他在比武大会上想必塑造了自己英勇的形象，穿着那身闪亮的新盔甲，还有那件弯月披风。只可惜他死不逢时，您还来不及问他就……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2786');"><p>Ned felt half-poisoned himself. "The squire," he said. "Ser Hugh." Wheels within wheels within wheels. Ned’s head was pounding. "Why? Why now? Jon Arryn had been Hand for fourteen years. What was he doing that they had to kill him?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2786" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德觉得自己仿佛也给下了毒。“原来是那个侍从，”他说，“修夫爵士。”真是谜中有谜，错综复杂。奈德脑中怦怦作响。“为什么？为什么选在这个时候？琼恩•艾林已经当了十四年的首相，他到底做了什么，逼得他们非杀他不可？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2787');"><p>"Asking questions," Varys said, slipping out the door.
