</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1112');"><p>Ned and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to her one night in Bran’s sickroom, carrying a reading lamp and the books of account. "It is past time that we reviewed the figures, my lady," he said. "You’ll want to know how much this royal visit cost us."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1112" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德和两个女儿离开后的第十八天夜里，鲁温学士带着一盏写字灯和账本，来到布兰的病房求见。“夫人，我们该清点账目了，”他说，“这样您才知道这次招待王室的开销。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1113');"><p>Catelyn looked at Bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead. It had grown very long, she realized. She would have to cut it soon. "I have no need to look at figures, Maester Luwin," she told him, never taking her eyes from Bran. "I know what the visit cost us. Take the books away."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1113" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳望着病榻上的布兰，拨开他额间细发，忽然察觉到他的头发长得好长，她得尽快找时间帮他修剪。“鲁温师傅，用不着给我看账目，”她告诉他，视线始终离不开布兰。“我知道宴客的支出有多吓人。把账本拿走罢。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1114');"><p>"My lady, the king’s party had healthy appetites. We must replenish our stores before..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1114" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“夫人，国王的手下食量很大，我们得赶紧补充城里的存粮，以免……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1115');"><p>She cut him off. "I said, take the books away. The steward will attend to our needs."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1115" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她打断他：“我说过，把账本拿走。这些事交给总管去处理。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1116');"><p>"We have no steward," Maester Luwin reminded her. Like a little grey rat, she thought, he would not let go. "Poole went south to establish Lord Eddard’s household at King’s Landing."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1116" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们没有总管了，”鲁温学士提醒她。他就像只灰鼠，她心想，咬住了就不肯罢休。“普尔随同老爷南下去了君临，以管理艾德大人的家务事。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1117');"><p>Catelyn nodded absently. "Oh, yes. I remember." Bran looked so pale. She wondered whether they might move his bed under the window, so he could get the morning sun.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1117" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳漫不经心地点点头。“噢，对，我想起来了。”布兰看起来好苍白，她暗自思索不知能否把病床移到窗边，好让他晒点早晨的太阳。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1118');"><p>Maester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick. "There are several appointments that require your immediate attention, my lady. Besides the steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory’s place, a new master of horse..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1118" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温学士把油灯安置在门边的壁龛里，胡乱捻着灯芯。“夫人，还有好些职务要请您立刻决定。除总管外，我们需要一名新的守卫队长，以替代乔里的位子，还有新的马房总管——”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1119');"><p>Her eyes snapped around and found him. "A master of horse?" Her voice was a whip.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1119" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的双眼倏地转去，紧紧盯住他。“马房总管？”她的声音如鞭子破空。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1120');"><p>The maester was shaken. "Yes, my lady. Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard, so..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1120" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>老学士显然被吓了一跳。“是的，夫人，胡伦也和艾德大人一起南下，所以——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1121');"><p>"My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of horse? Do you think I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it matters to me one whit? I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would open Bran’s eyes, do you understand that? Do you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1121" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“鲁温，我儿子支离破碎地躺在这里等死，你却要跟我讨论一个管马的家伙？你觉得我在乎马厩里发生了什么事吗？你觉得那边发生的事和我沾得上一点边吗？如果杀光全城的马可以让布兰睁开眼睛，我会很乐意地亲自动手，你听懂了没有？听懂了没有？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1122');"><p>He bowed his head. "Yes, my lady, but the appointments..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1122" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他低下头。“夫人，我听得懂，但是这些职位等不——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1123');"><p>"I’ll make the appointments," Robb said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1123" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我来安排。”罗柏道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1124');"><p>Catelyn had not heard him enter, but there he stood in the doorway, looking at her. She had been shouting, she realized with a sudden flush of shame. What was happening to her? She was so tired, and her head hurt all the time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1124" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳没听见罗柏的脚步声，但抬头就发现他站在过道里，定定地看着她。她想起自己刚才大呼小叫的举动，脸倏地一红，为自己羞耻。我究竟是怎么了？她只觉得好累，头一整天痛个没完。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1125');"><p>Maester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son. "I have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices," he said, offering Robb a paper plucked from his sleeve.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1125" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>鲁温师傅看看凯特琳，又看看她儿子。“我已经列好一份合适人选的名单。”他边说边从袖子里掏出一张纸交给罗柏。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1126');"><p>Her son glanced at the names. He had come from outside, Catelyn saw; his cheeks were red from the cold, his hair shaggy and windblown. "Good men," he said. "We’ll talk about them tomorrow." He handed back the list of names.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1126" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的儿子扫了一眼清单上的名字。凯特琳这才发现他刚从外面回来，两颊给冻得红扑扑，头发也被风吹得乱七八糟。“都是很好的人选，”他说，“我们明天再来谈谈这事。”他把名单交还鲁温学士。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1127');"><p>"Very good, my lord." The paper vanished into his sleeve.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1127" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好的，大人。”那张纸立刻消失在他袖子里。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1128');"><p>"Leave us now," Robb said. Maester Luwin bowed and departed. Robb closed the door behind him and turned to her. He was wearing a sword, she saw. "Mother, what are you doing?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1128" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你先退下吧。”罗柏道。鲁温学士颔首离去，罗柏关上门，转身面对她。她看到他身上还配了把剑。“母亲，你这又是何苦呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1129');"><p>Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like her; like Bran and Rickon and Sansa, he had the Tully coloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. Yet now for the first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in his face, something as stern and hard as the north. "What am I doing?" she echoed, puzzled. "How can you ask that? What do you imagine I’m doing? I am taking care of your brother. I am taking care of Bran."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1129" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳一直都觉得罗柏长得最像她。他和布兰、瑞肯、珊莎一样，生有一副徒利家的漂亮颜色——枣红头发、碧蓝眼瞳，如今她再一次在他脸上读了艾德•史塔克的神色，一种属于北方的坚毅冷峻。“我怎么了？”她困惑地应道，“你怎么能问这种话？你以为我在做什么，我在照顾你弟弟，我在照顾布兰哪。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1130');"><p>"Is that what you call it? You haven’t left this room since Bran was hurt. You didn’t even come to the gate when Father and the girls went south."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1130" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这哪叫照顾？自布兰受伤以来，你就没踏出这房间半步，连父亲和妹妹他们南下的时候，你也没到城门口去送行。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1131');"><p>"I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window." She had begged Ned not to go, not now, not after what had happened; everything had changed now, couldn’t he see that? It was no use. He had no choice, he had told her, and then he left, choosing. "I can’t leave him, even for a moment, not when any moment could be his last. I have to be with him, if?.?.?.?if?.?.?.?" She took her son’s limp hand, sliding his fingers through her own. He was so frail and thin, with no strength left in his hand, but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1131" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我在这房里跟他们道了别，还在窗边目送他们离去。”当时她苦苦哀求奈德别走，尤其在发生了这种惨剧之后。难道他看不出来现在一切都改变了吗？结果却徒劳无功，他说他别无选择，而他的选择就是南下。“我不能丢下他，哪怕一刻也不行，他随时可能咽下最后一口气。我得守着他，以免……以免……”她握起爱子了无生气的手掌，把他的手指滑过自己的指间。他实在好脆弱好消瘦，手里半点力气也没有，好在透过他的皮肤，仍旧能感觉生命的温暖。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1132');"><p>Robb’s voice softened. "He’s not going to die, Mother. Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1132" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏的语气和缓下来：“母亲，他不会死的，鲁温师傅说危险期已经过了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1133');"><p>"And what if Maester Luwin is wrong? What if Bran needs me and I’m not here?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1133" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那要是鲁温师傅错了呢？要是布兰需要我时我却不在呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1134');"><p>"Rickon needs you," Robb said sharply. "He’s only three, he doesn’t understand what’s happening. He thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying. I don’t know what to do with him." He paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way he’d done when he was little. "Mother, I need you too. I’m trying but I can’t?.?.?.?I can’t do it all by myself." His voice broke with sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen. She wanted to get up and go to him, but Bran was still holding her hand and she could not move.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1134" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“需要你的人是瑞肯，”罗柏语锋转厉，“他才三岁，还根本搞不清事态。他只以为大家都不要他了，所以成天跟着我，抱着我大腿又哭又闹，我真不知该怎么办才好！”说到这里他突然停了下来，像他小时候习惯的那样咬咬下嘴唇。“妈，我也需要你啊。我很努力在尝试，可我……我一个人做不来啊！”随着这突如其来的情绪激动，他的声音陡地沙哑，凯特琳这才想起他不过十四岁。她好想站起来去抱抱他，但布兰仍旧握着她的手，她没法动弹。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1135');"><p>Outside the tower, a wolf began to howl. Catelyn trembled, just for a second.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1135" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>高塔之外传来一声狼嚎，凯特琳不禁浑身颤抖。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1136');"><p>"Bran’s." Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room. The howling grew louder. It was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy and despair.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1136" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是布兰的狼。”罗柏打开窗，让晚风灌进窒闷的高塔斗室。狼嚎声越来越大，那是一种冷彻心肺的孤绝之音，充满忧郁和绝望。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1137');"><p>"Don’t," she told him. "Bran needs to stay warm."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1137" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“别开窗，”她告诉他，“让布兰暖和点。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1138');"><p>"He needs to hear them sing," Robb said. Somewhere out in Winterfell, a second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first. Then a third, closer. "Shaggydog and Grey Wind," Robb said as their voices rose and fell together. "You can tell them apart if you listen close."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1138" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他需要听听小狼的叫声。”罗柏道。在临冬城的某处，又有一只狼加入到长嚎的阵容，之后又是一只，这次离高塔比较近。“是毛毛狗和灰风。”在高低起伏，抑扬顿挫的狼嚎声中，罗柏说：“仔细听，你可以分辨出他们。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1139');"><p>Catelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls. "Make them stop!" she cried. "I can’t stand it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1139" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳却仍旧颤抖不已，这不仅因为悲伤，因为寒冷，还因为冰原狼的叫声。夜复一夜，日复一日，狼嚎、凛风和灰暗空寂的城堡，漫无边际地延续，恒常不变，而她的爱子却倒卧病榻，这是她最甜美的孩子，那个爱笑，爱爬，爱做骑士梦的布兰，如今全成了过眼云烟，只怕此生再也听不到他的笑声。思及此处，她泣不成声，不顾一切地自他掌中抽出双手，捂住耳朵，不愿再听外面那骇人的狼嚎。“叫他们别叫了！”她喊，“我受不了，叫他们别叫了，别叫了，就算杀了他们也没关系，只要他们别叫就好！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1140');"><p>She didn’t remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and Robb was lifting her, holding her in strong arms. "Don’t be afraid, Mother. They would never hurt him." He helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom. "Close your eyes," he said gently. "Rest. Maester Luwin tells me you’ve hardly slept since Bran’s fall."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1140" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她不记得自己何时跌倒在地，但她确实在地上，罗柏扶她起身，用强壮的双臂环住她。“母亲，您别怕，他们绝对不会伤害布兰。”他搀她走到病房角落她的狭窄小床边。“闭上眼睛，”他温柔地说，“好好休息。鲁温师傅跟我说打布兰出事以来您几乎没阖过眼。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1141');"><p>"I can’t," she wept. "Gods forgive me, Robb, I can’t, what if he dies while I’m asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies?.?.?.?" The wolves were still howling. She screamed and held her ears again. "Oh, gods, close the window!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_1141" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我怎么能休息？”她啜泣，“诸神开眼，罗柏，我不能休息，万一他在我熟睡时过去了，万一……万一……”窗外狼嚎依旧。她高声尖叫，再度捂紧耳朵。“噢，天哪，天哪，关上窗子罢！”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1142');"><p>"If you swear to me you’ll sleep." Robb went to the window, but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves. "Dogs," he said, listening. "All the dogs are barking. They’ve never done that before?.?.?.?" Catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat. When she looked up, his face was pale in the lamplight. "Fire," he whispered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1142" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“如果你答应我先睡一会儿，我就关。”罗柏走到窗边，就在他伸手去拉的时候，冰原狼的悲鸣中又添加了一种新的声音。“是狗叫，”他专心倾听，“全城的狗都跟着叫起来了，它们以前不会这样的……”凯特琳听见他的呼吸哽在喉咙，便抬起头，只见灯光下他面容惨白。“失火了。”他喃喃道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1143');"><p>Fire, she thought, and then, Bran! "Help me," she said urgently, sitting up. "Help me with Bran."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1143" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>失火了，她的第一反应是，救救布兰！“快帮帮我，”她催促，“快帮我把布兰抱起来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1144');"><p>Robb did not seem to hear her. "The library tower’s on fire," he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1144" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>可罗柏好像根本没听见。“藏书塔失火了。”他说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1145');"><p>Catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now. She sagged with relief. Bran was safe. The library was across the bailey, there was no way the fire would reach them here. "Thank the gods," she whispered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1145" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>透过敞开的窗户，凯特琳看见闪曳的红色亮光。她如释重负，布兰安全了，藏书塔位于城廓之外，火势无论如何没有蔓延到这里的可能。“感谢老天。”她低声轻语。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1146');"><p>Robb looked at her as if she’d gone mad. "Mother, stay here. I’ll come back as soon as the fire’s out." He ran then. She heard him shout to the guards outside the room, heard them descending together in a wild rush, taking the stairs two and three at a time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1146" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>罗柏看她的眼神仿佛将她当成了疯子，“母亲，请您留在这里，火势扑灭之后我就回来。”说完他便跑了出去。她听见他朝门外守卫发号施令，随后他们三步并作两步急奔下楼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1147');"><p>Outside, there were shouts of "Fire!" in the yard, screams, running footsteps, the whinny of frightened horses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs. The howling was gone, she realized as she listened to the cacophony. The direwolves had fallen silent.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1147" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>外面广场上传来“失火了！”的呐喊、尖叫、奔跑的脚步声、受惊的马儿嘶鸣以及惊狂的狗吠。在阵阵不和谐的声响中，她突然发现听不见狼嚎了，不知怎地，冰原狼都安静了下来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1148');"><p>Catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window. Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries. Then she closed the shutters.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1148" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳走向窗边，心中朝着至高七神默默祷告，以示感激之情。隔着城廓，只见长长的火舌自藏书高塔窗间吐舐而出。她望着浓烟直冲云霄，不禁暗自为陷身火海的珍本古籍而惋惜，它们可都是史塔克家族历经多少世代辛苦累积的精华哪。然后她关上了窗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1149');"><p>When she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1149" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>转过身，她才发现屋里多了一名男子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1150');"><p>"You weren’t s’posed to be here," he muttered sourly. "No one was s’posed to be here."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1150" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你不该在这儿，”他阴沉地嘀咕，“这里不该有人。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1151');"><p>He was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses. Catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables, and he was none of them. He was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in his hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1151" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他穿着一身脏污的褐色衣服，个头很小，浑身散发出马臊味。凯特琳对在马厩工作的仆人了如指掌，却对眼前来人毫无印象。他骨瘦如柴，生了一头软塌的金黄色头发，暗淡的双眼凹陷在皮包骨的脸上，手里握着一把匕首。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1152');"><p>Catelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran. "No," she said. The word stuck in her throat, the merest whisper.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1152" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>凯特琳望望那把刀，再看看布兰。“不。”她说。话卡在喉咙里出不来，传出的只剩最微弱的低语。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1153');"><p>He must have heard her. "It’s a mercy," he said. "He’s dead already."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1153" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>想必他还是听到了。“这是为他好。”他说，“反正他跟死人也没两样。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1154');"><p>"No," Catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again. "No, you can’t." She spun back toward the window to scream for help, but the man moved faster than she would have believed. One hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head, the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe. The stench of him was overwhelming.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1154" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不，”凯特琳找回了声音，说话大声起来。“不行，不准你这么做！”她箭步奔向窗边想大声呼救，但对方的动作快得惊人，他飞快地伸出一只手捂住她的嘴巴，将她的头往后扯，利刃随即架上她的咽喉。他全身臭气熏天，她简直快要窒息。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1155');"><p>She reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength, pulling it away from her throat. She heard him cursing into her ear. Her fingers were slippery with blood, but she would not let go of the dagger. The hand over her mouth clenched more tightly, shutting off her air. Catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth. She bit down hard into his palm. The man grunted in pain. She ground her teeth together and tore at him, and all of a sudden he let go. The taste of his blood filled her mouth. She sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him, and she stumbled and went down, and then he was standing over her, breathing hard, shaking. The dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand, slick with blood. "You weren’t s’posed to be here," he repeated stupidly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1155" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她双手齐伸握住匕首，死命将之扯离喉咙。耳边传来他的咒骂，虽然指间鲜血淋漓，她却依旧不肯放手。捂住她嘴巴的手钳臸得更紧，使她呼吸困难。凯特琳猛力扭头，在上下齿缝间找到他的手，狠狠地咬将下去。男人痛苦地闷哼一声，她又咬紧牙关用力撕扯，迫使他陡地松开手。她满嘴都是血腥，深深吸了口气，然后厉声尖叫起来。男子见状，忙一把攫住她的头发，使劲一推，她踉跄跌步，倒在地上。他站在她身边大声喘息，颤抖不已，右手仍紧握着那把匕首，刃锋上全是血。“你不该在这儿。”他笨拙地重复这句话。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1156');"><p>Catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him. There was a low rumble, less than a snarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard something, because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap. They went down together, half sprawled over Catelyn where she’d fallen. The wolf had him under the jaw. The man’s shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head, taking out half his throat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1156" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，凯特琳看见一道黑影从他身后的门口溜了进来，低低地吼了一声，算不上咆哮，只能说是充满威胁的低语。但他应该还是听见了，因为当狼飞身跃起朝他扑去时，他正准备转身。人和狼同时扑翻在地，卧倒在凯特琳跌落的地方。狼张口便咬，男人的惨叫持续还不到一秒，狼便一扭头，拧下他半个喉咙。

"Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses. I will welcome your company, Ser Rodrik. We will follow the White Knife down to the sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor. Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to King’s Landing well ahead of Ned and the Lannisters." And then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see.
