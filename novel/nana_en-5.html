</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_832');"><p>At the Varietes they were giving the thirty-fourth performance of the Blonde Venus. The first act had just finished, and in the greenroom Simonne, dressed as the little laundress, was standing in front of a console table, surmounted by a looking glass and situated between the two corner doors which opened obliquely on the end of the dressing-room passage. No one was with her, and she was scrutinizing her face and rubbing her finger up and down below her eyes with a view to putting the finishing touches to her make-up. The gas jets on either side of the mirror flooded her with warm, crude light.
</p></origin><translate id="div_832" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>游艺剧院里，正在上演《金发爱神》，这出戏现在已经演到第三十四场了。第一幕刚刚演完。在演员休息室里，扮演小洗衣妇的西蒙娜，站在一面镜子前，这面镜子是安装在一张蜗形脚桌子上面的。桌子两边，均有一扇角门，斜对着通往演员化妆室的走廊。她独身一人在端详自己，用一只手指在眼睛下轻轻涂抹，竭力把自己装扮得更好一些。镜子两边的煤气灯，发出强烈的光芒，把她身上照得暖和和的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_833');"><p>"Has he arrived?" asked Prulliere, entering the room in his Alpine admiral's costume, which was set off by a big sword, enormous top boots and a vast tuft of plumes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_833" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他来了吗？”普律利埃尔问道，他刚刚走进来，穿着瑞士海军上将制服，身佩一把军刀，脚穿一双大皮靴，头顶上插着一大撮翎毛。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_834');"><p>"Who d'you mean?" said Simonne, taking no notice of him and laughing into the mirror in order to see how her lips looked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_834" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“谁呀！”西蒙娜问道，身子一动也不动，只是对着镜子笑，注视着自己的嘴唇。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_835');"><p>"The prince."
</p></origin><translate id="div_835" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“王子。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_836');"><p>"I don't know; I've just come down. Oh, he's certainly due here tonight; he comes every time!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_836" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我不知道，我就下楼……啊！他会来的。他不是每天都来嘛！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_837');"><p>Prulliere had drawn near the hearth opposite the console table, where a coke fire was blazing and two more gas jets were flaring brightly. He lifted his eyes and looked at the clock and the barometer on his right hand and on his left. They had gilded sphinxes by way of adornment in the style of the First Empire. Then he stretched himself out in a huge armchair with ears, the green velvet of which had been so worn by four generations of comedians that it looked yellow in places, and there he stayed, with moveless limbs and vacant eyes, in that weary and resigned attitude peculiar to actors who are used to long waits before their turn for going on the stage.
</p></origin><translate id="div_837" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>普律利埃尔走到桌子对面的壁炉旁边，壁炉里燃着焦炭；壁炉两边各有一盏煤气灯，发出耀眼夺目的光芒。他抬头看看左边的时钟和右边的晴雨计，上面都饰有镀金的狮身人面像，时钟和晴雨计都是拿破仑时代的款式。接着，他往一张很大的扶手椅里一躺，椅子上的绿绒套历经四代演员的使用，已经发黄了。他坐在那里，一动也不动，眼睛模模糊糊，那副疲乏而又顺从的样子，一看就知道他是一个老演员，正在等待上场。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_838');"><p>Old Bosc, too, had just made his appearance. He came in dragging one foot behind the other and coughing. He was wrapped in an old box coat, part of which had slipped from his shoulder in such a way as to uncover the gold-laced cloak of King Dagobert. He put his crown on the piano and for a moment or two stood moodily stamping his feet. His hands were trembling slightly with the first beginnings of alcoholism, but he looked a sterling old fellow for all that, and a long white beard lent that fiery tippler's face of his a truly venerable appearance. Then in the silence of the room, while the shower of hail was whipping the panes of the great window that looked out on the courtyard, he shook himself disgustedly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_838" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>博斯克老头也来了。他拖着脚步，咳嗽着，身穿一件黄色旧外套，外套的一个角从肩上滑下来，露出扮演达戈贝尔特王穿的饰金银箔片的上衣。他把王冠往钢琴上一搁，一声没吭，怏怏不悦地跺了一会脚，不过，样子还像是诚实人。他的双手有些颤抖，这是饮酒后的最初征兆。而他那长长的银须，却给那副酒鬼的红红的面孔上，增添了可尊敬的外貌。在寂静中，骤然下起暴雨，雨点打在朝向庭院的那扇方形大窗户的玻璃上，他做了一个厌烦的手势。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_839');"><p>"What filthy weather!" he growled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_839" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这鬼天气！”他嘟囔道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_840');"><p>Simonne and Prulliere did not move. Four or five pictures—a landscape, a portrait of the actor Vernet—hung yellowing in the hot glare of the gas, and a bust of Potier, one of the bygone glories of the Varietes, stood gazing vacant-eyed from its pedestal. But just then there was a burst of voices outside. It was Fontan, dressed for the second act. He was a young dandy, and his habiliments, even to his gloves, were entirely yellow.
</p></origin><translate id="div_840" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西蒙娜和普律利埃尔没有动。四五幅风景画、一幅演员韦尔内的肖像被煤气灯熏黄了。一根柱子上雕刻着波蒂埃的半身像，他是当年游艺剧院的光荣，现在一双眼睛茫然注视着。这时外边传来哇啦哇啦的说话声。原来是丰唐，他穿着第二幕上场的戏装，扮演一个漂亮公子，浑身上下都是黄色，连手套也是黄的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_841');"><p>"Now say you don't know!" he shouted, gesticulating. "Today's my patron saint's day!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_841" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂！”他手舞足蹈地喊着，“你们不知道吧？今天是我的圣名瞻礼日。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_842');"><p>"What?" asked Simonne, coming up smilingly, as though attracted by the huge nose and the vast, comic mouth of the man. "D'you answer to the name of Achille?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_842" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是吗！”西蒙娜问道，一边笑着走过去，好像被他的大鼻子和滑稽的大嘴巴吸引住了，“你的圣名叫阿喀琉斯①吧？”  
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_843');"><p>"Exactly so! And I'm going to get 'em to tell Madame Bron to send up champagne after the second act."
</p></origin><translate id="div_843" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一点不错！……我要让人告诉布龙太太，让她在第二幕演完时，拿香槟酒上来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_844');"><p>For some seconds a bell had been ringing in the distance. The long-drawn sound grew fainter, then louder, and when the bell ceased a shout ran up the stair and down it till it was lost along the passages. "All on the stage for the second act! All on the stage for the second act!" The sound drew near, and a little pale-faced man passed by the greenroom doors, outside each of which he yelled at the top of his shrill voice, "On the stage for the second act!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_844" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>远处响起了铃声。悠长的声音变得越来越低，然后又响起来。当铃声停止时，听见一个人在楼梯上跑上跑下叫喊着，最后喊声消失在走廊里：“第二幕上场喽！……第二幕上场喽！……”这喊声越来越近，一个面色苍白、矮个头男人走过演员休息室的每个门口，拉高尖尖的嗓门嚷道：“第二幕上场喽！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_845');"><p>"The deuce, it's champagne!" said Prulliere without appearing to hear the din. "You're prospering!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_845" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真棒！香槟酒！”普律利埃尔说道，他似乎没听到那叫喊的声音，“你好吧！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_846');"><p>"If I were you I should have it in from the cafe," old Bosc slowly announced. He was sitting on a bench covered with green velvet, with his head against the wall.
</p></origin><translate id="div_846" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我要是你，我就叫人送咖啡来。”博斯克老头慢吞吞说道，他坐在一条绿绒软垫长凳上，头倚在墙上。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_847');"><p>But Simonne said that it was one's duty to consider Mme Bron's small perquisites. She clapped her hands excitedly and devoured Fontan with her gaze while his long goatlike visage kept up a continuous twitching of eyes and nose and mouth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_847" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西蒙娜说应当让布龙太太收小费。她拍着手，显出兴高采烈的样子，把目光死命盯着丰唐。丰唐戴着山羊面具，眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴动个不停。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_848');"><p>"Oh, that Fontan!" she murmured. "There's no one like him, no one like him!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_848" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！这个丰唐！”她喃喃说道，“只有他才能演这个角色，只有他才能演这个角色！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_849');"><p>The two greenroom doors stood wide open to the corridor leading to the wings. And along the yellow wall, which was brightly lit up by a gas lamp out of view, passed a string of rapidly moving shadows—men in costume, women with shawls over their scant attire, in a word, the whole of the characters in the second act, who would shortly make their appearance as masqeuraders in the ball at the Boule Noire. And at the end of the corridor became audible a shuffling of feet as these people clattered down the five wooden steps which led to the stage. As the big Clarisse went running by Simonne called to her, but she said she would be back directly. And, indeed, she reappeared almost at once, shivering in the thin tunic and scarf which she wore as Iris.
</p></origin><translate id="div_849" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>演员休息室的两扇门朝向走廊，一直敞开着，走廊直通后台。发黄的墙壁被一盏看不见的煤气灯照得通亮，墙上飞快地闪动着一个个人影，有身穿戏装的男人，有身着披肩的半裸体女人，还有在第二幕中演群众角色的全体演员，以及光顾“黑球咖啡馆”的低级舞场的那伙人。在走廊的一头，可以听见演员踏着五级木板梯级下楼去舞台的声音。高个儿克拉利瑟跑过时，西蒙娜叫她，她回答说，她马上就回来。她果然马上就回来了，她穿着虹神的薄薄紧身上衣，披着虹神的披肩，冷得浑身直打哆嗦。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_850');"><p>"God bless me!" she said. "It isn't warm, and I've left my furs in my dressing room!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_850" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎呀！”她说道，“这里不暖和，我把毛皮大衣留在化妆室里了！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_851');"><p>Then as she stood toasting her legs in their warm rose-colored tights in front of the fireplace she resumed:
</p></origin><translate id="div_851" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>随后，她站到壁炉前面去烤腿，拖到大腿的紧身上衣被火光映成玫瑰色，闪闪发光。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_852');"><p>"The prince has arrived."
</p></origin><translate id="div_852" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“王子来了。”她又说了一句。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_853');"><p>"Oh!" cried the rest with the utmost curiosity.
</p></origin><translate id="div_853" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！”其他人都惊奇地叫起来。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_854');"><p>"Yes, that's why I ran down: I wanted to see. He's in the first stage box to the right, the same he was in on Thursday. It's the third time he's been this week, eh? That's Nana; well, she's in luck's way! I was willing to wager he wouldn't come again."
</p></origin><translate id="div_854" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是啊，我刚才跑过去就是为了这事，我想去看一看……他坐在右首台口第一个包厢里，就是星期四坐的那个包厢。嗯？一周内他第三次来看戏了。这个娜娜真走运……我还打过赌，说他不会再来了呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_855');"><p>Simonne opened her lips to speak, but her remarks were drowned by a fresh shout which arose close to the greenroom. In the passage the callboy was yelling at the top of his shrill voice, "They've knocked!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_855" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西蒙娜刚开口说话，她的声音就被演员休息室旁边发出的又一阵声音盖下去了。催场员拉高嗓门在走廊里大声叫道： “敲过开场锣啦！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_856');"><p>"Three times!" said Simonne when she was again able to speak. "It's getting exciting. You know, he won't go to her place; he takes her to his. And it seems that he has to pay for it too!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_856" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“来过三次啦，真够呛，”西蒙娜刚等到能开口时说道，“你们知道，他不肯到她家里去，而要把她带到自己家里。听说这要让他花不小代价呢。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_857');"><p>"Egad! It's a case of when one 'has to go out,'" muttered Prulliere wickedly, and he got up to have a last look at the mirror as became a handsome fellow whom the boxes adored.
</p></origin><translate id="div_857" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然罗！人家出去价钱总要高一些嘛！”普律利埃尔怪声怪气地说着，一边站起来，往镜子里看了一眼，自我欣赏一下被包厢里的观众宠爱的美男子的仪表。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_858');"><p>"They've knocked! They've knocked!" the callboy kept repeating in tones that died gradually away in the distance as he passed through the various stories and corridors.
</p></origin><translate id="div_858" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“敲过锣了！敲过锣了！”催场员不停喊着，喊声渐渐减弱，他跑遍了每层楼，每道走廊。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_859');"><p>Fontan thereupon, knowing how it had all gone off on the first occasion the prince and Nana met, told the two women the whole story while they in their turn crowded against him and laughed at the tops of their voices whenever he stooped to whisper certain details in their ears. Old Bosc had never budged an inch—he was totally indifferent. That sort of thing no longer interested him now. He was stroking a great tortoise-shell cat which was lying curled up on the bench. He did so quite beautifully and ended by taking her in his arms with the tender good nature becoming a worn-out monarch. The cat arched its back and then, after a prolonged sniff at the big white beard, the gluey odor of which doubtless disgusted her, she turned and, curling herself up, went to sleep again on the bench beside him. Bosc remained grave and absorbed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_859" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丰唐知道王子同娜娜第一次接触的情况，于是，他就把详细情况告诉了两个女人。她俩紧紧靠在他的身边，当他弯着身子讲到一些细节时，她们不禁哈哈大笑起来。博斯克老头一动也不动，露出一副无动于衷的样子。他对这类事情毫无兴趣。他在抚摸着一只红色肥猫，那猫静静地蜷缩在一张长椅子上。抚摸到后来，他竟然把它抱在怀里，他那善良、温存的面容，颇像一个年老糊涂的国王。猫把背拱得高高的，接着嗅了好一阵子他长长的白胡子，大概厌恶白胡子上的胶水味，又回到长椅子上，把身子缩成一团睡觉了。博斯克仍然是那副严肃而沉思的样子。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_860');"><p>"That's all right, but if I were you I should drink the champagne at the restaurant—its better there," he said, suddenly addressing Fontan when he had finished his recital.
</p></origin><translate id="div_860" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喝点香槟酒倒没关系，我要是你，我要喝咖啡馆里的香槟酒，那里的香槟酒好一些。”丰唐刚讲完故事，博斯克突然对他说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_861');"><p>"The curtain's up!" cried the callboy in cracked and long-drawn accents "The curtain's up! The curtain's up!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_861" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“开场啦！”催场员拖着破锣般的嗓子叫道，“开场啦！开场啦！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_862');"><p>The shout sounded for some moments, during which there had been a noise of rapid footsteps. Through the suddenly opened door of the passage came a burst of music and a far-off murmur of voices, and then the door shut to again and you could hear its dull thud as it wedged itself into position once more.
</p></origin><translate id="div_862" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>叫声停止了，这时响起急促的脚步声，走廊的门骤然打开了，传来了一阵音乐声和在远处发出的嘈杂声。于是，有人把门一关，塞垫料的门扉发出一声沉闷的声音。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_863');"><p>A heavy, peaceful, atmosphere again pervaded the greenroom, as though the place were situated a hundred leagues from the house where crowds were applauding. Simonne and Clarisse were still on the topic of Nana. There was a girl who never hurried herself! Why, yesterday she had again come on too late! But there was a silence, for a tall damsel had just craned her head in at the door and, seeing that she had made a mistake, had departed to the other end of the passage. It was Satin. Wearing a hat and a small veil for the nonce she was affecting the manner of a lady about to pay a call.
</p></origin><translate id="div_863" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一片宁静又笼罩了演员休息室，寂静得好像离掌声四起的演出厅足有百里之遥。西蒙娜和克拉利瑟还在谈论娜娜。娜娜总是慢吞吞的！昨天她又误了上场。这时有一个身材高大的姑娘伸头向屋里张望，她们立刻住口了，接着，她发觉自己找错了房间，就向走廊的另一头跑去。她是萨丹，头戴帽子，脸上蒙着面纱，装扮成一副来找人的样子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_864');"><p>"A pretty trollop!" muttered Prulliere, who had been coming across her for a year past at the Cafe des Varietes. And at this Simonne told them how Nana had recognized in Satin an old schoolmate, had taken a vast fancy to her and was now plaguing Bordenave to let her make a first appearance on the stage.
</p></origin><translate id="div_864" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“一个道地的婊子。”普律利埃尔咕哝道，一年来，他在游艺咖啡馆经常见到她。于是西蒙娜对大家说，娜娜是怎样认出她昔日寄宿学校的同学萨丹的，怎样对她着了迷，又怎样缠住博尔德纳夫，要求他把自己推上舞台。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_865');"><p>"How d'ye do?" said Fontan, shaking hands with Mignon and Fauchery, who now came into the room.
</p></origin><translate id="div_865" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂，晚上好！”丰唐一边说，一边同刚进来的米尼翁和福什利握手。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_866');"><p>Old Bosc himself gave them the tips of his fingers while the two women kissed Mignon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_866" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>博斯克老头也伸出手来同他们握手，而两个女人则拥抱了米尼翁。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_867');"><p>"A good house this evening?" queried Fauchery.
</p></origin><translate id="div_867" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“今晚观众看得起劲吧？”福什利问道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_868');"><p>"Oh, a splendid one!" replied Prulliere. "You should see 'em gaping."
</p></origin><translate id="div_868" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！好极了！”普律利埃尔回答，“观众看得着迷喽！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_869');"><p>"I say, my little dears," remarked Mignon, "it must be your turn!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_869" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂！孩子们，”米尼翁提醒道，“轮到你们上场啦！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_870');"><p>Oh, all in good time! They were only at the fourth scene as yet, but Bosc got up in obedience to instinct, as became a rattling old actor who felt that his cue was coming. At that very moment the callboy was opening the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_870" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们知道了，不过还要等一会儿。他们要到第四场才上场呢。只有博斯克本能地站远来，他是老演员，演戏很卖力，他准备上场。就在这时候，催场员来到了门口。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_871');"><p>"Monsieur Bosc!" he called. "Mademoiselle Simonne!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_871" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“博斯克先生！西蒙娜小姐！”他叫道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_872');"><p>Simonne flung a fur-lined pelisse briskly over her shoulders and went out. Bosc, without hurrying at all, went and got his crown, which he settled on his brow with a rap. Then dragging himself unsteadily along in his greatcoat, he took his departure, grumbling and looking as annoyed as a man who has been rudely disturbed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_872" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>西蒙娜匆匆把一件皮袄往肩上一披，就出去了。博斯克不慌不忙地去找他的王冠，然后往前额上一戴，再用手一拍。随后，他穿着拖到地上的长袍，步履蹒跚地走了，嘴里嘀咕着，一副不高兴的样子，像被人打扰了似的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_873');"><p>"You were very amiable in your last notice," continued Fontan, addressing Fauchery. "Only why do you say that comedians are vain?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_873" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你最近的那篇文章写得很好，”丰唐对福什利说道，“不过，你为什么说喜剧演员都爱虚荣呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_874');"><p>"Yes, my little man, why d'you say that?" shouted Mignon, bringing down his huge hands on the journalist's slender shoulders with such force as almost to double him up.
</p></origin><translate id="div_874" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是啊，亲爱的，你为什么这样说呢？”米尼翁嚷道，他用粗大的手往记者瘦削的肩上一拍，他被拍得腰都弯了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_875');"><p>Prulliere and Clarisse refrained from laughing aloud. For some time past the whole company had been deriving amusement from a comedy which was going on in the wings. Mignon, rendered frantic by his wife's caprice and annoyed at the thought that this man Fauchery brought nothing but a certain doubtful notoriety to his household, had conceived the idea of revenging himself on the journalist by overwhelming him with tokens of friendship. Every evening, therefore, when he met him behind scenes he would shower friendly slaps on his back and shoulders, as though fairly carried away by an outburst of tenderness, and Fauchery, who was a frail, small man in comparison with such a giant, was fain to take the raps with a strained smile in order not to quarrel with Rose's husband.
</p></origin><translate id="div_875" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>普律利埃尔和克拉利瑟几乎失声大笑起来。一个时期以来，全体演员对在后台发生的滑稽事情很感兴趣。米尼翁对他妻子的朝三暮四很恼火，看到福什利带给他们夫妻的仅仅是一些引起争论的广告性小文章，于是他便想出一种方法来进行报复，那就是对他表示过分亲热。每天晚上，他在台上碰到福什利时，就对他拍拍打打，好像亲热得很，而福什利在米尼翁这个巨人旁边，则显得很孱弱，为了不跟罗丝的丈夫闹翻脸，他不得不强笑忍受着。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_876');"><p>"Aha, my buck, you've insulted Fontan," resumed Mignon, who was doing his best to force the joke. "Stand on guard! One—two—got him right in the middle of his chest!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_876" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“啊！好家伙，你侮辱了丰唐，”米尼翁跟他开玩笑，说道，“当心！一，二，嘭！打在胸口上了！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_877');"><p>He lunged and struck the young man with such force that the latter grew very pale and could not speak for some seconds. With a wink Clarisse showed the others where Rose Mignon was standing on the threshold of the greenroom. Rose had witnessed the scene, and she marched straight up to the journalist, as though she had failed to notice her husband and, standing on tiptoe, bare-armed and in baby costume, she held her face up to him with a caressing, infantine pout.
</p></origin><translate id="div_877" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他做了一个击剑时冲刺的动作，对他这样一击，福什利脸色变得苍白，一时说不出话来。克拉利瑟向其他人眨眨眼睛，示意罗丝米尼翁正站在演员休息室门口。罗丝已经看到了刚才的情景。她径直向新闻记者走去，仿佛没有看见她的丈夫似的；她身穿娃娃服装，裸露着双臂，踮起脚尖，把额头送上去让记者亲吻，如同孩子撅嘴撒娇一样。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_878');"><p>"Good evening, baby," said Fauchery, kissing her familiarly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_878" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“晚安，宝贝。”福什利说道，亲切地吻了她一下。

Everybody was swallowed up in the distance, and when the passage door had banged with its usual hollow sound a fresh hail shower was heard beating against the windows in the now-silent greenroom. Barillot, a small, pale-faced ancient, who for thirty years had been a servant in the theater, had advanced familiarly toward Mignon and had presented his open snuffbox to him. This proffer of a pinch and its acceptance allowed him a minute's rest in his interminable career up and down stairs and along the dressing-room passage. He certainly had still to look up Mme Nana, as he called her, but she was one of those who followed her own sweet will and didn't care a pin for penalties. Why, if she chose to be too late she was too late! But he stopped short and murmured in great surprise:

Well, well, it wouldn't do to grow angry with anybody. Here was a position that would have to be won again. From fireplace to console table Mignon paced, sunk in thought yet still unconquered by circumstances. There was no one in the greenroom now save Fauchery and himself. The journalist was tired and had flung himself back into the recesses of the big armchair. There he stayed with half-closed eyes and as quiet as quiet could be, while the other glanced down at him as he passed. When they were alone Mignon scorned to slap him at every turn. What good would it have done, since nobody would have enjoyed the spectacle? He was far too disinterested to be personally entertained by the farcical scenes in which he figured as a bantering husband. Glad of this short-lived respite, Fauchery stretched his feet out languidly toward the fire and let his upturned eyes wander from the barometer to the clock. In the course of his march Mignon planted himself in front of Potier's bust, looked at it without seeming to see it and then turned back to the window, outside which yawned the darkling gulf of the courtyard. The rain had ceased, and there was now a deep silence in the room, which the fierce heat of the coke fire and the flare of the gas jets rendered still more oppressive. Not a sound came from the wings: the staircase and the passages were deadly still.

Then across the twilight stage, which was no longer lit up by the footlights, there followed a disorderly retreat. Actors and supers and chorus made haste to get back to their dressing rooms while the sceneshifters rapidly changed the scenery. Simonne and Clarisse, however, had remained "at the top," talking together in whispers. On the stage, in an interval between their lines, they had just settled a little matter. Clarisse, after viewing the thing in every light, found she preferred not to see La Faloise, who could never decide to leave her for Gaga, and so Simonne was simply to go and explain that a woman ought not to be palled up to in that fashion! At last she agreed to undertake the mission.
</p></origin><translate id="div_910" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在经久不息的雷鸣般的掌声中，幕布徐徐降落下来，演员们随即乱哄哄地退场。舞台上的光线昏昏暗暗，因为台口的成排脚灯已经熄灭了。主要演员和群众演员仓促回到他们的化妆室里，置景工人们火速撤走布景。然而，西蒙娜和克拉利瑟仍然滞留在舞台的后边，在悄声谈话。刚才演出时，她们利用念台词中间的空隙时间，商定了一件事情。克拉利瑟经过一番周密考虑，不想去见拉法卢瓦兹，这个人下不了决心放弃她，去与加加要好。西蒙娜将去向他解释，一个男人不能这样缠住一个女人不放。最后，她答应去转达克拉利瑟拜托的事。

And in the middle of this untidy, ill-kept storeroom sat four fashionable, white-gloved society men. They occupied as many ancient straw-bottomed chairs and, with an expression at once patient and submissive, kept sharply turning their heads in Mme Bron's direction every time she came down from the theater overhead, for on such occasions she was the bearer of replies. Indeed, she had but now handed a note to a young man who had hurried out to open it beneath the gaslight in the vestibule, where he had grown slightly pale on reading the classic phrase—how often had others read it in that very place!—"Impossible tonight, my dearie! I'm booked!" La Faloise sat on one of these chairs at the back of the room, between the table and the stove. He seemed bent on passing the evening there, and yet he was not quite happy. Indeed, he kept tucking up his long legs in his endeavors to escape from a whole litter of black kittens who were gamboling wildly round them while the mother cat sat bolt upright, staring at him with yellow eyes.

Under the stairs in a sort of deep cupboard she kept a little bar, whither the supers were wont to descend for drinks between the acts, and seeing that just at that moment there were five or six tall lubbers there who, still dressed as Boule Noire masqueraders, were dying of thirst and in a great hurry, she lost her head a bit. A gas jet was flaring in the cupboard, within which it was possible to descry a tin-covered table and some shelves garnished with half-emptied bottles. Whenever the door of this coalhole was opened a violent whiff of alcohol mingled with the scent of stale cooking in the lodge, as well as with the penetrating scent of the flowers upon the table.

Largely and strongly built, light of beard and rosy of hue, he was not lacking in the kind of distinction peculiar to a sturdy man of pleasure, the square contours of whose limbs are clearly defined by the irreproachable cut of a frock coat. Behind him walked Count Muffat and the Marquis de Chouard, but this particular corner of the theater being dark, the group were lost to view amid huge moving shadows.

On the contrary, he was greatly interested and kept pausing in order to look at the sceneshifters' maneuvers. A batten had just been lowered, and the group of gaslights high up among its iron crossbars illuminated the stage with a wide beam of light. Muffat, who had never yet been behind scenes at a theater, was even more astonished than the rest. An uneasy feeling of mingled fear and vague repugnance took possession of him. He looked up into the heights above him, where more battens, the gas jets on which were burning low, gleamed like galaxies of little bluish stars amid a chaos of iron rods, connecting lines of all sizes, hanging stages and canvases spread out in space, like huge cloths hung out to dry.

They were setting the scenery for the third act, which was the grotto on Mount Etna. Men were busy planting masts in the sockets, while others went and took frames which were leaning against the walls of the stage and proceeded to lash them with strong cords to the poles already in position. At the back of the stage, with a view to producing the bright rays thrown by Vulcan's glowing forge, a stand had been fixed by a limelight man, who was now lighting various burners under red glasses. The scene was one of confusion, verging to all appearances on absolute chaos, but every little move had been prearranged. Nay, amid all the scurry the whistle blower even took a few turns, stepping short as he did so, in order to rest his legs.

The really sharp downward slope of the stage had surprised him disagreeably, and he owed no small part of his present anxiety to a feeling that its boards were moving under his feet. Through the open sockets gas was descried burning in the "dock." Human voices and blasts of air, as from a vault, came up thence, and, looking down into the depths of gloom, one became aware of a whole subterranean existence. But just as the count was going up the stage a small incident occurred to stop him. Two little women, dressed for the third act, were chatting by the peephole in the curtain. One of them, straining forward and widening the hole with her fingers in order the better to observe things, was scanning the house beyond.
</p></origin><translate id="div_931" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>缪法伯爵已经向通演员化妆室的走廊走去。舞台的坡度相当大，不禁使他大吃一惊，但他更担心的是他脚下的那块地，他觉得它是活动的。从布景滑槽的槽缝望下去，可以看见下面燃着的煤气灯，下面是一派地下生活的景象，看下去像黑沉沉的深渊，人声可闻，并刮着微风，风像从地窖中吹出来似的。可是当他再往上走时，有一件事情使他止步了。两个身穿戏服准备演第三幕的小娘儿们，在幕布的孔眼前闲聊。其中一人挺着腰，用手指把幕眼扒大，想看个清楚，她正在向场内四下张望。

He gazed warmly at the little woman who did not care a button for His Highness, and she, on her part, laughed unblushingly. Bordenave, however, persuaded the prince to follow him. Muffat was beginning to perspire; he had taken his hat off. What inconvenienced him most was the stuffy, dense, overheated air of the place with its strong, haunting smell, a smell peculiar to this part of a theater, and, as such, compact of the reek of gas, of the glue used in the manufacture of the scenery, of dirty dark nooks and corners and of questionably clean chorus girls. In the passage the air was still more suffocating, and one seemed to breathe a poisoned atmosphere, which was occasionally relieved by the acid scents of toilet waters and the perfumes of various soaps emanating from the dressing rooms. The count lifted his eyes as he passed and glanced up the staircase, for he was well-nigh startled by the keen flood of light and warmth which flowed down upon his back and shoulders. High up above him there was a clicking of ewers and basins, a sound of laughter and of people calling to one another, a banging of doors, which in their continual opening and shutting allowed an odor of womankind to escape—a musky scent of oils and essences mingling with the natural pungency exhaled from human tresses. He did not stop. Nay, he hastened his walk: he almost ran, his skin tingling with the breath of that fiery approach to a world he knew nothing of.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_946');"><p>Nana vouchsafed no further reply, but the curtain began moving. Doubtless she was making up her mind. Then Count Muffat, with glowing cheeks, began to take stock of the dressing room. It was a square room with a very low ceiling, and it was entirely hung with a light-colored Havana stuff. A curtain of the same material depended from a copper rod and formed a sort of recess at the end of the room, while two large windows opened on the courtyard of the theater and were faced, at a distance of three yards at most, by a leprous-looking wall against which the panes cast squares of yellow light amid the surrounding darkness. A large dressing glass faced a white marble toilet table, which was garnished with a disorderly array of flasks and glass boxes containing oils, essences and powders. The count went up to the dressing glass and discovered that he was looking very flushed and had small drops of perspiration on his forehead. He dropped his eyes and came and took up a position in front of the toilet table, where the basin, full of soapy water, the small, scattered, ivory toilet utensils and the damp sponges, appeared for some moments to absorb his attention. The feeling of dizziness which he had experienced when he first visited Nana in the Boulevard Haussmann once more overcame him. He felt the thick carpet soften under foot, and the gasjets burning by the dressing table and by the glass seemed to shoot whistling flames about his temples. For one moment, being afraid of fainting away under the influence of those feminine odors which he now re-encountered, intensified by the heat under the low-pitched ceiling, he sat down on the edge of a softly padded divan between the two windows. But he got up again almost directly and, returning to the dressing table, seemed to gaze with vacant eyes into space, for he was thinking of a bouquet of tuberoses which had once faded in his bedroom and had nearly killed him in their death. When tuberoses are turning brown they have a human smell.
</p></origin><translate id="div_946" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜虽然没有回答，只见帷幕动了，她大概已打定主意出来。这时缪法伯爵脸上涨得通红，仔细察看这间化妆室。这是一间方方正正的房子，屋顶很低，四周墙壁上全挂着浅栗色的装饰布。帷幔也是同样的料子，吊在一根铜杆上，把屋子后边隔成一个小间。两扇宽大的窗户朝向剧院的庭院，离窗户最多三公尺远处，有一堵斑斑点点的围墙。夜色中，屋子里的灯光，透过窗户上的玻璃，射出一块块方形黄色光亮，映在那堵围墙上。一面大穿衣镜对着一张白色大理石梳妆台，上面乱七八糟地摆放着一些装头油、香水和香粉的瓶子和水晶盒子。伯爵走近穿衣镜，看见自己脸色发红，额头上沁出小滴汗珠；他走到梳妆台前面，立在那儿，眼睛向下看，洗脸池内盛满了肥皂水，象牙小用具乱散着，海绵湿漉漉的，一时间，他似乎看得出神了。他头一次到奥斯曼大街娜娜家里拜访她时，他头脑中产生的令人眼花缭乱的景象，现在又浮现在他的脑际。在他的脚下，他感到化妆室的厚厚的地毯变软了；梳妆台上方和穿衣镜上方燃着的煤气灯，似乎在他的太阳穴周围咝咝作响。他又闻到了这种女人的气味，这气味在低矮的天花板下变得热乎乎的，浓度似乎增加了百倍。一阵子他害怕被这种气味熏倒，便坐到摆在两扇窗户之间的一张软垫长沙发上。但是他马上又站起来，回到梳妆台前，什么也不看，眸子模模糊糊，回忆起昔日在他的卧室里凋谢的一束晚香玉，他差点被它的香味熏死。晚香玉凋谢时，会散发出人体的气味。

In a corner of the room Satin, with her pure, virginal face, was scanning the gentlemen keenly, while the dresser, Mme Jules by name, was getting ready Venus' tights and tunic. Mme Jules was a woman of no age. She had the parchment skin and changeless features peculiar to old maids whom no one ever knew in their younger years. She had indeed shriveled up in the burning atmosphere of the dressing rooms and amid the most famous thighs and bosoms in all Paris. She wore everlastingly a faded black dress, and on her flat and sexless chest a perfect forest of pins clustered above the spot where her heart should have been.

She had not clothed herself at all, had, in fact, only buttoned on a little pair of linen stays which half revealed her bosom. When the gentlemen had put her to flight she had scarcely begun undressing and was rapidly taking off her fishwife's costume. Through the opening in her drawers behind a corner of her shift was even now visible. There she stood, bare-armed, bare-shouldered, bare-breasted, in all the adorable glory of her youth and plump, fair beauty, but she still held the curtain with one hand, as though ready to draw it to again upon the slightest provocation.

Suddenly she seemed to recognize Count Muffat, and she extended her hand to him as an old friend. Then she scolded him for not having come to her supper party. His Highness deigned to chaff Muffat about this, and the latter stammered and thrilled again at the thought that for one second he had held in his own feverish clasp a little fresh and perfumed hand. The count had dined excellently at the prince's, who, indeed, was a heroic eater and drinker. Both of them were even a little intoxicated, but they behaved very creditably. To hide the commotion within him Muffat could only remark about the heat.
</p></origin><translate id="div_957" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她的臀部很大，把裤子撑得鼓鼓的；胸脯隆起，嘴角上挂着甜蜜的微笑，边走边向大家致意。突然间，她似乎认出了缪法伯爵，她像朋友一样向他伸出手去。尔后，她埋怨他不来参加 她的夜宵。王子殿下竟忘了自己的身份，与缪法开玩笑。缪法支支吾吾，激动得打着哆嗦，他刚才用他热乎乎的手握了 她的小手，那手刚刚用香水洗过，还有点凉呢。伯爵在王子家里饱餐了一顿，王子也是个能吃善饮的人。现在两人都有几分醉意，但是他们的举止还很得体。缪法为了不让自己流露出内心的激动，便找出一句话来打打岔：

Bordenave drew back the slide over a grated peephole of the kind used in convents. Fontan was outside with Prulliere and Bosc, and all three had bottles under their arms and their hands full of glasses. He began knocking and shouting out that it was his patron saint's day and that he was standing champagne round. Nana consulted the prince with a glance. Eh! Oh dear, yes! His Highness did not want to be in anyone's way; he would be only too happy! But without waiting for permission Fontan came in, repeating in baby accents:

But the dressing room was too small to accommodate everybody, and it became necessary to crowd up anyhow, Satin and Mme Jules standing back against the curtain at the end and the men clustering closely round the half-naked Nana. The three actors still had on the costumes they had been wearing in the second act, and while Prulliere took off his Alpine admiral's cocked hat, the huge plume of which would have knocked the ceiling, Bosc, in his purple cloak and tinware crown, steadied himself on his tipsy old legs and greeted the prince as became a monarch receiving the son of a powerful neighbor. The glasses were filled, and the company began clinking them together.

There was no more jesting now—the company were at court. Actual life was prolonged in the life of the theater, and a sort of solemn farce was enacted under the hot flare of the gas. Nana, quite forgetting that she was in her drawers and that a corner of her shift stuck out behind, became the great lady, the queen of love, in act to open her most private palace chambers to state dignitaries. In every sentence she used the words "Royal Highness" and, bowing with the utmost conviction, treated the masqueraders, Bosc and Prulliere, as if the one were a sovereign and the other his attendant minister. And no one dreamed of smiling at this strange contrast, this real prince, this heir to a throne, drinking a petty actor's champagne and taking his ease amid a carnival of gods, a masquerade of royalty, in the society of dressers and courtesans, shabby players and showmen of venal beauty. Bordenave was simply ravished by the dramatic aspects of the scene and began dreaming of the receipts which would have accrued had His Highness only consented thus to appear in the second act of the Blonde Venus.

The place, indeed, was like an alcove or narrow bathroom, full as it was of the steam of hot water and sponges and of the strong scent of essences which mingled with the tartish, intoxicating fumes of the champagne. The prince and Count Muffat, between whom Nana was wedged, had to lift up their hands so as not to brush against her hips or her breast with every little movement. And there stood Mme Jules, waiting, cool and rigid as ever, while Satin, marveling in the depths of her vicious soul to see a prince and two gentlemen in black coats going after a naked woman in the society of dressed-up actors, secretly concluded that fashionable people were not so very particular after all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_980" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时候，殿下的礼服的后摆扫到梳妆台的大理石上。这间屋子颇像卧室中放床的凹室，也像一间狭小的洗澡间，空气中弥漫着盥洗盆和湿海绵散发出来的水气，浓郁的香水气味，还夹杂着一点醉汉呼出来的香槟酒酸味。娜娜紧紧夹在王子和缪法伯爵中间，他俩不得不一直举着手，否则，他们只要稍微动一下手就会碰到她的屁股或乳房。朱勒太太脸上一滴汗也没有，依然呆板地呆在那里。连萨丹这样生活堕落的女人，看到王子殿下和几位穿着礼服的先生同几个身穿戏服的演员在一起，与一个半裸体的女人厮混，都感到惊讶，不禁暗暗思忖着，大人先生们也已经不那么干净了。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_995');"><p>This time Nana did not turn round. She had taken up the hare's-foot and was lightly manipulating it. All her attention was concentrated on this action, and she bent forward over her toilet table so very far that the white round contour of her drawers and the little patch of chemise stood out with the unwonted tension. But she was anxious to prove that she appreciated the old man's compliment and therefore made a little swinging movement with her hips.
</p></origin><translate id="div_995" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这一次，娜娜可没有转过身来。她拿起粉扑，在脸上轻轻地、仔细地扑着，身子在梳妆台上方弯得很厉害，圆圆的屁股鼓了起来，绷得紧紧的白内裤都看得出来，还露出一小角衬衫。但是对老头子的恭维话也要有点反应，她就摇摇身子，屁股也随着扭几下，这就算是对老头子的回答。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_996');"><p>Silence reigned. Mme Jules had noticed a tear in the right leg of her drawers. She took a pin from over her heart and for a second or so knelt on the ground, busily at work about Nana's leg, while the young woman, without seeming to notice her presence, applied the rice powder, taking extreme pains as she did so, to avoid putting any on the upper part of her cheeks. But when the prince remarked that if she were to come and sing in London all England would want to applaud her, she laughed amiably and turned round for a moment with her left cheek looking very white amid a perfect cloud of powder. Then she became suddenly serious, for she had come to the operation of rouging. And with her face once more close to the mirror, she dipped her finger in a jar and began applying the rouge below her eyes and gently spreading it back toward her temples. The gentlemen maintained a respectful silence.
</p></origin><translate id="div_996" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们沉默了一会儿。朱勒太太发现娜娜的右裤腿上撕了一道口子，她就在自己的衣服胸襟上取下一根别针，然后跪在地上，在娜娜的大腿周围忙了一阵子。娜娜似乎并不知道她在那儿，仍然搽她的香粉，她小心翼翼地搽，生怕粉搽到颧颊上。这时，王子说，如果她愿意到伦敦去演唱，全英国的人都会给她鼓掌。娜娜莞尔一笑，她把身子转过来一会儿。她的左颊搽得雪白，周围飘着白粉。接着，她突然严肃起来；她开始抹胭脂。她又把脸对准镜子，一个手指放在一个罐子里浸一下，她先把胭脂涂在眼睛下面，再把它慢慢抹开，一直抹到太阳穴。 这几位先生们默不作声，恭恭敬敬地在一旁观看。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_997');"><p>Count Muffat, indeed, had not yet opened his lips. He was thinking perforce of his own youth. The bedroom of his childish days had been quite cold, and later, when he had reached the age of sixteen and would give his mother a good-night kiss every evening, he used to carry the icy feeling of the embrace into the world of dreams. One day in passing a half-open door he had caught sight of a maidservant washing herself, and that was the solitary recollection which had in any way troubled his peace of mind from the days of puberty till the time of marriage. Afterward he had found his wife strictly obedient to her conjugal duties but had himself felt a species of religious dislike to them. He had grown to man's estate and was now aging, in ignorance of the flesh, in the humble observance of rigid devotional practices and in obedience to a rule of life full of precepts and moral laws. And now suddenly he was dropped down in this actress's dressing room in the presence of this undraped courtesan.
</p></origin><translate id="div_997" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>缪法伯爵还未开口说话。他不禁回忆起自己的青年时代。他孩提时代的卧室很冷。后来，到了十六岁时，他每天晚上睡觉前都要亲吻他的母亲，并把这个冷冰冰的吻带进睡梦中。一天，他走过一扇半掩着的门口时，发现一个女仆在擦身子；从他的青春期到结婚时，这是唯一令他惴惴不安的回忆。结婚后，他发现妻子严格尽她做妻子的本分。而他自己呢，则是一个虔诚的信徒，对两性生活感到反感。他长大了，变老了，还没有领受过肉体的快感，他的信条是屈从严厉的教规，在生活中，按照教训和教律行事。而现在他却被人突然带到了这间女明星的化妆室，置身于这个赤身裸体的年轻女子前面。

His whole being was in turmoil; he was terrified by the stealthy, all-pervading influence which for some time past Nana's presence had been exercising over him, and he recalled to mind the pious accounts of diabolic possession which had amused his early years. He was a believer in the devil, and, in a confused kind of way, Nana was he, with her laughter and her bosom and her hips, which seemed swollen with many vices. But he promised himself that he would be strong—nay, he would know how to defend himself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_998" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>过去，他连缪法伯爵夫人怎样系袜带都从未见过。而现在却在这个罐子和面盆狼藉的地方，在这如此浓郁和芳香的气味中，亲眼目睹女人化妆时的隐秘细节。他的整个身心都充满反感，一段时期以来，娜娜对他的潜移默化，令他恐惧起来。他回忆起阅读过的宗教书籍，回忆起儿童时代听到的魔鬼附身的故事。他相信魔鬼的存在。他隐约感到，娜娜就是魔鬼，她的笑声，她的乳房，她的屁股，无不充满了罪恶。不过，他决心做一个强者。 他是能够自卫的。

But directly afterward he was surprised and angry with himself. Why, in the presence of this courtesan, should the idea of being virtuous embarrass him? He could have struck her. But in attempting to take up a brush Nana had just let it drop on the ground, and as she stooped to pick it up he rushed forward. Their breath mingled for one moment, and the loosened tresses of Venus flowed over his hands. But remorse mingled with his enjoyment, a kind of enjoyment, moreover, peculiar to good Catholics, whom the fear of hell torments in the midst of their sin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1001" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜听见谈到伯爵的德行，用奇异的目光瞧瞧他，缪法随之产生了强烈的反感。接着，他对自己的反感又感到奇怪，便责怪起自己来。在这个婊子面前，为什么想到自己有道德，就感到不好意思呢？他早该揍她一顿。这时，娜娜要去拿一支画眉笔，不小心把它碰落到地上；当她弯腰去捡时，他也赶紧跑过去捡，两个人的呼气汇合在一起了，爱神披散的头发落到他的手上。顿时他感到一种快感，快感中又夹杂着内疚，这是一种天主教徒的快感，由于怕因犯罪而入地狱使这种快感变得更加强烈了。

And despite all his endeavors he could not turn away his gaze from that face so merry with dimples and so worn with desire, which the closed eye rendered more seductive. When she shut her right eye and passed the brush along it he understood that he belonged to her.

He was ravished by the perverse transformation wrought by powders and paints and filled by a lawless yearning for those young painted charms, for the too-red mouth and the too-white face and the exaggerated eyes, ringed round with black and burning and dying for very love. Meanwhile Nana went behind the curtain for a second or two in order to take off her drawers and slip on Venus' tights. After which, with tranquil immodesty, she came out and undid her little linen stays and held out her arms to Mme Jules, who drew the short-sleeved tunic over them.

Mme Jules, with vacant, unconcerned eyes and an expression suggestive of a little elderly wooden doll, still kept circling round her. With brisk movements she took pins out of the inexhaustible pincushion over her heart and pinned up Venus' tunic, but as she ran over all those plump nude charms with her shriveled hands, nothing was suggested to her. She was as one whom her sex does not concern.

The actors waiting for their cues were being scared by quite a serious episode. For some seconds past Mignon had been renewing his jokes and smothering Fauchery with caresses. He had at last invented a little game of a novel kind and had begun flicking the other's nose in order, as he phrased it, to keep the flies off him. This kind of game naturally diverted the actors to any extent.

He had launched forth into extravagant courses and had given the journalist a box on the ear, an actual, a vigorous, box on the ear. This time he had gone too far: in the presence of so many spectators it was impossible for Fauchery to pocket such a blow with laughing equanimity. Whereupon the two men had desisted from their farce, had sprung at one another's throats, their faces livid with hate, and were now rolling over and over behind a set of side lights, pounding away at each other as though they weren't breakable.

To make matters worse, Rose Mignon arrived out of breath at the very moment she was due on the stage. Vulcan, indeed, was giving her the cue, but Rose stood rooted to the ground, marveling at sight of her husband and her lover as they lay wallowing at her feet, strangling one another, kicking, tearing their hair out and whitening their coats with dust. They barred the way. A sceneshifter had even stopped Fauchery's hat just when the devilish thing was going to bound onto the stage in the middle of the struggle. Meanwhile Vulcan, who had been gagging away to amuse the audience, gave Rose her cue a second time. But she stood motionless, still gazing at the two men.

As Count Muffat was coming up in order to peep between two of the wings at the stage, he understood from a sign made him by the stage manager that he was to step softly. Drowsy warmth was streaming down from the flies, and in the wings, which were lit by vivid patches of light, only a few people remained, talking in low voices or making off on tiptoe. The gasman was at his post amid an intricate arrangement of cocks; a fireman, leaning against the side lights, was craning forward, trying to catch a glimpse of things, while on his seat, high up, the curtain man was watching with resigned expression, careless of the play, constantly on the alert for the bell to ring him to his duty among the ropes. And amid the close air and the shuffling of feet and the sound of whispering, the voices of the actors on the stage sounded strange, deadened, surprisingly discordant. Farther off again, above the confused noises of the band, a vast breathing sound was audible. It was the breath of the house, which sometimes swelled up till it burst in vague rumors, in laughter, in applause. Though invisible, the presence of the public could be felt, even in the silences.

Indeed, he obtained an oblique back view of the scenery and of the wings which had been strengthened, as it were, by a thick layer of old posters. Then he caught sight of a corner of the stage, of the Etna cave hollowed out in a silver mine and of Vulcan's forge in the background. Battens, lowered from above, lit up a sparkling substance which had been laid on with large dabs of the brush. Side lights with red glasses and blue were so placed as to produce the appearance of a fiery brazier, while on the floor of the stage, in the far background, long lines of gaslight had been laid down in order to throw a wall of dark rocks into sharp relief. Hard by on a gentle, "practicable" incline, amid little points of light resembling the illumination lamps scattered about in the grass on the night of a public holiday, old Mme Drouard, who played Juno, was sitting dazed and sleepy, waiting for her cue.

Bordenave lowered his voice and furiously reproached the portress for having allowed the Tricon to come in. That woman! And on such an evening of all others! It made him so angry because His Highness was there! Mme Bron, who had been thirty years in the theater, replied quite sourly. How was she to know? she asked. The Tricon did business with all the ladies—M. le Directeur had met her a score of times without making remarks. And while Bordenave was muttering oaths the Tricon stood quietly by, scrutinizing the prince as became a woman who weighs a man at a glance. A smile lit up her yellow face. Presently she paced slowly off through the crowd of deeply deferential little women.

As she was not playing in the third act, she had a mind to be off at once and accordingly begged Clarisse to go and see if the man were there. Clarisse was only due on the stage toward the end of the act, and so she went downstairs while Simonne ran up for a minute to their common dressing room.

The little business plied by the good portress must have been progressing finely, for the cellarlike hole under the stairs was wet with emptied heeltaps and water. Clarisse picked up the tunic of Iris, which was dragging over the greasy steps behind her, but she halted prudently at the turn in the stairs and was content simply to crane forward and peer into the lodge. She certainly had been quick to scent things out! Just fancy! That idiot La Faloise was still there, sitting on the same old chair between the table and the stove! He had made pretense of sneaking off in front of Simonne and had returned after her departure. For the matter of that, the lodge was still full of gentlemen who sat there gloved, elegant, submissive and patient as ever. They were all waiting and viewing each other gravely as they waited. On the table there were now only some dirty plates, Mme Bron having recently distributed the last of the bouquets. A single fallen rose was withering on the floor in the neighborhood of the black cat, who had lain down and curled herself up while the kittens ran wild races and danced fierce gallops among the gentlemen's legs. Clarisse was momentarily inclined to turn La Faloise out. The idiot wasn't fond of animals, and that put the finishing touch to him!

And with that he had peaceably departed, as one who was doubtless used to the formula. He, at any rate, knew how to conduct himself! Not so the others, the fellows who sat there doggedly on Mme Bron's battered straw-bottomed chairs under the great glazed lantern, where the heat was enough to roast you and there was an unpleasant odor.

Above and beyond the glowing arc formed by the footlights the dark body of the house seemed full of ruddy vapor, and against this neutral-tinted background, where row upon row of faces struck a pale, uncertain note, Nana stood forth white and vast, so that the boxes from the balcony to the flies were blotted from view. He saw her from behind, noted her swelling hips, her outstretched arms, while down on the floor, on the same level as her feet, the prompter's head—an old man's head with a humble, honest face—stood on the edge of the stage, looking as though it had been severed from the body. At certain points in her opening number an undulating movement seemed to run from her neck to her waist and to die out in the trailing border of her tunic. When amid a tempest of applause she had sung her last note she bowed, and the gauze floated forth round about her limbs, and her hair swept over her waist as she bent sharply backward. And seeing her thus, as with bending form and with exaggerated hips she came backing toward the count's peephole, he stood upright again, and his face was very white. The stage had disappeared, and he now saw only the reverse side of the scenery with its display of old posters pasted up in every direction. On the practicable slope, among the lines of gas jets, the whole of Olympus had rejoined the dozing Mme Drouard. They were waiting for the close of the act. Bosc and Fontan sat on the floor with their knees drawn up to their chins, and Prulliere stretched himself and yawned before going on. Everybody was worn out; their eyes were red, and they were longing to go home to sleep.

An increasing sense of languor had left Muffat without any power of resistance, and after looking round for the Marquis de Chouard, who had disappeared, he ended by following the journalist. He experienced a mingled feeling of relief and anxiety as he left the wings whence he had been listening to Nana's songs.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1055');"><p>Fauchery had already preceded him up the staircase, which was closed on the first and second floors by low-paneled doors. It was one of those stairways which you find in miserable tenements. Count Muffat had seen many such during his rounds as member of the Benevolent Organization. It was bare and dilapidated: there was a wash of yellow paint on its walls; its steps had been worn by the incessant passage of feet, and its iron balustrade had grown smooth under the friction of many hands. On a level with the floor on every stairhead there was a low window which resembled a deep, square venthole, while in lanterns fastened to the walls flaring gas jets crudely illuminated the surrounding squalor and gave out a glowing heat which, as it mounted up the narrow stairwell, grew ever more intense.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1055" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>福什利先上了楼梯，这种楼梯在二楼和三楼都装有用于关闭楼梯的木头转门。这种楼梯在蹩脚的房屋里常常见到，缪法伯爵曾以赈济所委员的身份，去贫民家里走访过，他看到过这样的楼梯，上面装饰全无，破旧不堪，漆成黄色，梯级被脚上上下下踏损了，铁栏杆被手磨平了。每道楼梯的平台边，贴近地面都有一扇低矮的窗户，方方正正地凹进去，像是气窗。一些悬挂在墙壁上的灯笼，发出煤气光焰，强烈地照射着这种种贫寒景物，还散发出一股热气，向上升腾，并聚积在各层狭窄的螺旋形楼梯下。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1056');"><p>When he reached the foot of the stairs the count once more felt the hot breath upon his neck and shoulders. As of old it was laden with the odor of women, wafted amid floods of light and sound from the dressing rooms above, and now with every upward step he took the musky scent of powders and the tart perfume of toilet vinegars heated and bewildered him more and more. On the first floor two corridors ran backward, branching sharply off and presenting a set of doors to view which were painted yellow and numbered with great white numerals in such a way as to suggest a hotel with a bad reputation. The tiles on the floor had been many of them unbedded, and the old house being in a state of subsidence, they stuck up like hummocks. The count dashed recklessly forward, glanced through a half-open door and saw a very dirty room which resembled a barber's shop in a poor part of the town. In was furnished with two chairs, a mirror and a small table containing a drawer which had been blackened by the grease from brushes and combs. A great perspiring fellow with smoking shoulders was changing his linen there, while in a similar room next door a woman was drawing on her gloves preparatory to departure. Her hair was damp and out of curl, as though she had just had a bath. But Fauchery began calling the count, and the latter was rushing up without delay when a furious "damn!" burst from the corridor on the right. Mathilde, a little drab of a miss, had just broken her washhand basin, the soapy water from which was flowing out to the stairhead. A dressing room door banged noisily. Two women in their stays skipped across the passage, and another, with the hem of her shift in her mouth, appeared and immediately vanished from view. Then followed a sound of laughter, a dispute, the snatch of a song which was suddenly broken off short. All along the passage naked gleams, sudden visions of white skin and wan underlinen were observable through chinks in doorways. Two girls were making very merry, showing each other their birthmarks. One of them, a very young girl, almost a child, had drawn her skirts up over her knees in order to sew up a rent in her drawers, and the dressers, catching sight of the two men, drew some curtains half to for decency's sake. The wild stampede which follows the end of a play had already begun, the grand removal of white paint and rouge, the reassumption amid clouds of rice powder of ordinary attire. The strange animal scent came in whiffs of redoubled intensity through the lines of banging doors. On the third story Muffat abandoned himself to the feeling of intoxication which was overpowering him. For the chorus girls' dressing room was there, and you saw a crowd of twenty women and a wild display of soaps and flasks of lavender water. The place resembled the common room in a slum lodging house. As he passed by he heard fierce sounds of washing behind a closed door and a perfect storm raging in a washhand basin. And as he was mounting up to the topmost story of all, curiosity led him to risk one more little peep through an open loophole. The room was empty, and under the flare of the gas a solitary chamber pot stood forgotten among a heap of petticoats trailing on the floor. This room afforded him his ultimate impression. Upstairs on the fourth floor he was well-nigh suffocated. All the scents, all the blasts of heat, had found their goal there. The yellow ceiling looked as if it had been baked, and a lamp burned amid fumes of russet-colored fog. For some seconds he leaned upon the iron balustrade which felt warm and damp and well-nigh human to the touch. And he shut his eyes and drew a long breath and drank in the sexual atmosphere of the place. Hitherto he had been utterly ignorant of it, but now it beat full in his face.

It was a long, ill-built room under the roof with a garret ceiling and sloping walls. The light penetrated to it from two deep-set openings high up in the wall, but at that hour of the night the dressing room was lit by flaring gas. It was papered with a paper at seven sous a roll with a pattern of roses twining over green trelliswork. Two boards, placed near one another and covered with oilcloth, did duty for dressing tables. They were black with spilled water, and underneath them was a fine medley of dinted zinc jugs, slop pails and coarse yellow earthenware crocks. There was an array of fancy articles in the room—a battered, soiled and well-worn array of chipped basins, of toothless combs, of all those manifold untidy trifles which, in their hurry and carelessness, two women will leave scattered about when they undress and wash together amid purely temporary surroundings, the dirty aspect of which has ceased to concern them.

But what was his surprise when he found the Marquis de Chouard snugly enscounced on a chair between the two dressing tables! The marquis had withdrawn thither some time ago. He was spreading his feet apart because a pail was leaking and letting a whitish flood spread over the floor. He was visibly much at his ease, as became a man who knew all the snug corners, and had grown quite merry in the close dressing room, where people might have been bathing, and amid those quietly immodest feminine surroundings which the uncleanness of the little place rendered at once natural and poignant.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1069');"><p>And with that she darted off, and the count remained much embarrassed in his father-in-law's presence. The blood had rushed to his face. In Nana's dressing room, amid all the luxury of hangings and mirrors, he had not experienced the sharp physical sensation which the shameful wretchedness of that sorry garret excited within him, redolent as it was of these two girls' self-abandonment. Meanwhile the marquis had hurried in the rear of Simonne, who was making off at the top of her pace, and he kept whispering in her ear while she shook her head in token of refusal. Fauchery followed them, laughing. And with that the count found himself alone with the dresser, who was washing out the basins. Accordingly he took his departure, too, his legs almost failing under him. Once more he put up flights of half-dressed women and caused doors to bang as he advanced. But amid the disorderly, disbanded troops of girls to be found on each of the four stories, he was only distinctly aware of a cat, a great tortoise-shell cat, which went gliding upstairs through the ovenlike place where the air was poisoned with musk, rubbing its back against the banisters and keeping its tail exceedingly erect.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1069" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，她一溜烟地走了。伯爵在他的岳父面前，显得很尴尬，一股血涌到了他的脸上。刚才在娜娜的化妆室里，面对那些华丽的帷幔和镜子，倒没有感到强烈的兴奋，这时在这间被两个女人弄得乱七八糟、令人羞愧的寒碜陋室里却感到这样兴奋。这时侯爵跟在匆匆忙忙下楼的西蒙娜后边走了，他贴在她的耳边说话，而她总是摇摇头。福什利笑着跟在他们后边。这样，只有伯爵一个人和服装员留下来，服装员在洗脸盆。接着，伯爵也走了，他下楼梯时，两腿发软，他前面几个穿衬裙的女人，被他再次吓跑了。他走到她们门口时，她们把门砰的一声关上了。他跑了四层楼，每层都有卸了装的姑娘，她们三三两两，到处乱跑。他只看清楚一只猫，那是一只大红猫，在这个散发着香粉臭气、热得像火炉的地方，沿着梯级乱窜，还翘着尾巴，把背贴在栏杆的扶手上擦痒。

There was a veritable stampede on the staircase—its walls rang with exclamations, and everyone was in a savage hurry to dress and be off. As Count Muffat came down the last step or two he saw Nana and the prince passing slowly along the passage. The young woman halted and lowered her voice as she said with a smile:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1071" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>演出结束，幕布落了下来。楼梯上响起急促的脚步声，楼梯间一片呼喊声，大家都匆匆忙忙穿衣服，忙着回家。缪法伯爵走到最后一级楼梯时，看见娜娜和王子慢吞吞地走在走廊上。娜娜停下脚步，接着莞尔一笑，放低噪门说道：

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1073');"><p>The prince returned to the stage, where Bordenave was awaiting him. And left alone with Nana, Muffat gave way to an impulse of anger and desire. He ran up behind her and, as she was on the point of entering her dressing room, imprinted a rough kiss on her neck among little golden hairs curling low down between her shoulders. It was as though he had returned the kiss that had been given him upstairs. Nana was in a fury; she lifted her hand, but when she recognized the count she smiled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1073" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王子回到舞台上，博尔德纳夫在那里等他呢。于是，只有缪法一个人和娜娜在一起，他在怒气和性欲的驱使下，跑到娜娜的背后，当她向化妆室走去时，他在她的后颈上狂吻了一下，吻的部位是在两肩中间长得很低的卷曲、毛茸茸的一撮撮短发上。这个吻好像是对他在楼上时受到的吻的回报。娜娜生气了，抬起手来想打人。当她认出伯爵来时，嫣然一笑。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1075');"><p>And her smile was adorable in its embarrassment and submissiveness, as though she had despaired of this kiss and were happy to have received it. But she could do nothing for him either that evening or the day after. It was a case of waiting. Nay, even if it had been in her power she would still have let herself be desired. Her glance said as much. At length she continued:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1075" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她笑得挺可爱的，露出一副羞答答、乖顺的样子，好像原来对这一吻已经不抱希望了，而现在得到了，感到欣喜万分。但是，她不能迎合他的要求，今天晚上和明天都不行。必须让他等待一个时期。即使行，她也要吊吊他的胃口。从她的眼神中已经看出了这个意思。她最后说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1076');"><p>"I'm a landowner, you know. Yes, I'm buying a country house near Orleans, in a part of the world to which you sometimes betake yourself. Baby told me you did—little Georges Hugon, I mean. You know him? So come and see me down there."

</p></origin><translate id="div_1077" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵是个胆小的人，对自己刚才的唐突行动感到愧怕。他彬彬有礼地向她鞠了一个躬，并答应她一定接受她的邀请。随后，他走了，一边走一边想这想那。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1080');"><p>It was the Marquis de Chouard who was tumbling down over Satin. The girl had decidedly had enough of the fashionable world! Nana had certainly introduced her to Bordenave, but the necessity of standing with sealed lips for fear of allowing some awkward phrase to escape her had been too much for her feelings, and now she was anxious to regain her freedom, the more so as she had run against an old flame of hers in the wings. This was the super, to whom the task of impersonating Pluto had been entrusted, a pastry cook, who had already treated her to a whole week of love and flagellation. She was waiting for him, much irritated at the things the marquis was saying to her, as though she were one of those theatrical ladies! And so at last she assumed a highly respectable expression and jerked out this phrase:
</p></origin><translate id="div_1080" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她骂的是德舒阿尔侯爵，他不得已而找上了萨丹。但是她对上流社会的人物特别厌恶。娜娜刚才把她介绍给博尔德纳夫。不过，像这样呆着，嘴上贴上封条，生怕说出蠢话，这着实叫她受不了；现在她想得到补偿，正巧她在后台碰上了过去的情人，就是扮演冥王的那个配角。此人是糕点师，曾经给过她一个星期的爱情和耳光。她在等他，侯爵把她当成剧院的一个女演员，同她讲话，使她非常恼怒。所以，最后她摆出一副十分尊严的样子，说出这样一句话： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1081');"><p>"My husband's coming! You'll see."
</p></origin><translate id="div_1081" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我丈夫就要来了，你等着瞧吧！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1082');"><p>Meanwhile the worn-looking artistes were dropping off one after the other in their outdoor coats. Groups of men and women were coming down the little winding staircase, and the outlines of battered hats and worn-out shawls were visible in the shadows. They looked colorless and unlovely, as became poor play actors who have got rid of their paint. On the stage, where the side lights and battens were being extinguished, the prince was listening to an anecdote Bordenave was telling him. He was waiting for Nana, and when at length she made her appearance the stage was dark, and the fireman on duty was finishing his round, lantern in hand. Bordenave, in order to save His Highness going about by the Passage des Panoramas, had made them open the corridor which led from the porter's lodge to the entrance hall of the theater. Along this narrow alley little women were racing pell-mell, for they were delighted to escape from the men who were waiting for them in the other passage. They went jostling and elbowing along, casting apprehensive glances behind them and only breathing freely when they got outside. Fontan, Bosc and Prulliere, on the other hand, retired at a leisurely pace, joking at the figure cut by the serious, paying admirers who were striding up and down the Galerie des Varietes at a time when the little dears were escaping along the boulevard with the men of their hearts. But Clarisse was especially sly. She had her suspicions about La Faloise, and, as a matter of fact, he was still in his place in the lodge among the gentlemen obstinately waiting on Mme Bron's chairs. They all stretched forward, and with that she passed brazenly by in the wake of a friend. The gentlemen were blinking in bewilderment over the wild whirl of petticoats eddying at the foot of the narrow stairs. It made them desperate to think they had waited so long, only to see them all flying away like this without being able to recognize a single one. The litter of little black cats were sleeping on the oilcloth, nestled against their mother's belly, and the latter was stretching her paws out in a state of beatitude while the big tortoise-shell cat sat at the other end of the table, her tail stretched out behind her and her yellow eyes solemnly following the flight of the women.

Damp oozed from the walls, and the footfall sounded as hollow on the tiled floor as in an underground vault. It was crowded with the kind of rubbish usually found in a garret. There was a workbench on which the porter was wont to plane such parts of the scenery as required it, besides a pile of wooden barriers which at night were placed at the doors of the theater for the purpose of regulating the incoming stream of people. Nana had to pick up her dress as she passed a hydrant which, through having been carelessly turned off, was flooding the tiles underfoot. In the entrance hall the company bowed and said good-by. And when Bordenave was alone he summed up his opinion of the prince in a shrug of eminently philosophic disdain.

His Highness had handed Nana quietly into his carriage, and the marquis had slipped off after Satin and her super. In his excitement he was content to follow this vicious pair in vague hopes of some stray favor being granted him. Then with brain on fire Muffat decided to walk home. The struggle within him had wholly ceased. The ideas and beliefs of the last forty years were being drowned in a flood of new life. While he was passing along the boulevards the roll of the last carriages deafened him with the name of Nana; the gaslights set nude limbs dancing before his eyes—the nude limbs, the lithe arms, the white shoulders, of Nana. And he felt that he was hers utterly: he would have abjured everything, sold everything, to possess her for a single hour that very night. Youth, a lustful puberty of early manhood, was stirring within him at last, flaming up suddenly in the chaste heart of the Catholic and amid the dignified traditions of middle age.
