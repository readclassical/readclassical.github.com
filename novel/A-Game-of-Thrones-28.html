</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2400');"><p>It’s the Hand’s tourney that’s the cause of all the trouble, my lords," the Commander of the City Watch complained to the king’s council.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2400" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸位大人，这些麻烦都是首相的比武大会带来的。”都城守备队的司令官向御前会议抱怨。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2401');"><p>"The king’s tourney," Ned corrected, wincing. "I assure you, the Hand wants no part of it."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2401" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“国王的比武大会，”奈德皱着眉头纠正他，“我跟你保证，首相对这事一点兴趣都没有。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2402');"><p>"Call it what you will, my lord. Knights have been arriving from all over the realm, and for every knight we get two freeriders, three craftsmen, six men-at-arms, a dozen merchants, two dozen whores, and more thieves than I dare guess. This cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start, and now with all these visitors?.?.?.?last night we had a drowning, a tavern riot, three knife fights, a rape, two fires, robberies beyond count, and a drunken horse race down the Street of the Sisters. The night before a woman’s head was found in the Great Sept, floating in the rainbow pool. No one seems to know how it got there or who it belongs to."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2402" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您怎么说都行，大人，可事实是全国各地的骑士陆陆续续都来了哪。而每来一个骑士呢，跟着就来两个自由骑手、三个工匠、六个大兵、一打生意人、两打妓女，至于小偷，多到我猜都不敢猜。这该死的热天已经害城里半数人热得晕头转向，现在又来这么多家伙……昨儿晚上就有人溺死，外加一起酒馆暴乱，三起持刀械斗，一起强奸案，两场火灾，抢劫数不清啦，还有匹喝醉的马冲到修女街去了。前天呢，则有个女人的头被人发现漂在大圣堂的彩虹池里，没人知道那颗头是打哪儿来的，也没人知道那是谁的头。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2403');"><p>"How dreadful," Varys said with a shudder.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2403" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真是吓人哟。”瓦里斯打着哆嗦。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2404');"><p>Lord Renly Baratheon was less sympathetic. "If you cannot keep the king’s peace, Janos, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2404" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>蓝礼•拜拉席恩公爵可没他这么好心。“我说啊，杰诺斯，你要是连城里的臺序都无法维持，恐怕都城守卫队得换个有办法的人来当司令啰。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2405');"><p>Stout, jowly Janos Slynt puffed himself up like an angry frog, his bald pate reddening. "Aegon the Dragon himself could not keep the peace, Lord Renly. I need more men."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2405" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>史林特生得高头大马，一副双下巴，他听了这话立刻变得跟青蛙一样气鼓鼓的，光头顿时红了起来。“蓝礼大人，就算龙王伊耿再世也管不住。我需要人手。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2406');"><p>"How many?" Ned asked, leaning forward. As ever, Robert had not troubled himself to attend the council session, so it fell to his Hand to speak for him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2406" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你要多少人？”奈德倾身向前问。依惯例，劳勃又没参加会议，所以他这个“国王之手”只好代为发言。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2407');"><p>"As many as can be gotten, Lord Hand."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2407" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“首相大人，当然是越多越好。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2408');"><p>"Hire fifty new men," Ned told him. "Lord Baelish will see that you get the coin."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2408" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那就雇五十个新兵，”奈德告诉他，“钱的事交给贝里席大人打点。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2409');"><p>"I will?" Littlefinger said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2409" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我打点？”小指头说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2410');"><p>"You will. You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion’s purse, surely you can scrape together a few coppers to keep the king’s peace." Ned turned back to Janos Slynt. "I will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard, to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2410" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没错。既然你连比武冠军的四万金龙赏金都筹得出，多弄几个铜板维持城里臺序想必不成问题。”奈德转头对杰诺斯•史林特道，“我再从我的贴身护卫中拨二十个人给你，直到城里这批人离开为止。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2411');"><p>"All thanks, Lord Hand," Slynt said, bowing. "I promise you, they shall be put to good use."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2411" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“非常感谢，首相大人。”史林特鞠躬，“我向您保证，一定让他们派上用场。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2412');"><p>When the Commander had taken his leave, Eddard Stark turned to the rest of the council. "The sooner this folly is done with, the better I shall like it." As if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough, all and sundry insisted on salting Ned’s wound by calling it "the Hand’s tourney," as if he were the cause of it. And Robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored!
</p></origin><translate id="div_2412" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>司令官离开后，奈德转向在场重臣：“这场闹剧早一天结束，我就早一天安心。”仿佛筹措经费和接踵而至的麻烦还不够他受，所有的闲杂人等都把这叫做“首相的比武大会”，这无疑是在伤口上洒盐，好像他才是罪魁祸首。而劳勃竟当真以为他应该为此感到光荣！
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2413');"><p>"The realm prospers from such events, my lord," Grand Maester Pycelle said. "They bring the great the chance of glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2413" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“王国就是因为这种事才兴盛的啊，大人。”派席尔国师说，“对上等阶级而言，这是求取荣耀的大好时机。至于穷苦老百姓嘛，也能因此暂时忘忧解愁。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2414');"><p>"And put coins in many a pocket," Littlefinger added. "Every inn in the city is full, and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2414" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“很多人还能藉此大捞一笔，”小指头补充，“城里的旅店通通客满，妓女接客接到脚都合不拢，走起路来口袋里的铜板响叮当。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2415');"><p>Lord Renly laughed. "We’re fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us. Remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels? The king asked him if perhaps he’d like to outlaw eating, shitting, and breathing while he was at it. If truth be told, I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of his. He goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield, with a grim look in his eyes and a determination to do his duty."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2415" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>蓝礼公爵哈哈大笑：“还好我二哥史坦尼斯不在。记不记得那次他提议查禁妓院？结果国王问他说要不要顺便连吃饭、拉屎、呼吸也统统禁了算了。老实讲，有时候我真怀疑史坦尼斯那个丑女儿是怎么来的。老哥他上床简直跟上战场一样，眼神庄严肃穆，打定主意要履行他的责任。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2416');"><p>Ned had not joined the laughter. "I wonder about your brother Stannis as well. I wonder when he intends to end his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on this council."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2416" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德没有跟着笑。“我也在想你哥哥史坦尼斯的事，不知他何时才会结束龙石岛的探访，重新回到岗位。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2417');"><p>"No doubt as soon as we’ve scourged all those whores into the sea," Littlefinger replied, provoking more laughter.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2417" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“只要我们把妓女统统赶进海里，他就会马上回来了罢。”小指头此话一出，其他人笑得更厉害了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2418');"><p>"I have heard quite enough about whores for one day," Ned said, rising. "Until the morrow."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2418" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“关于妓女的事，我今天也听够了。”奈德起身说，“就到此为止。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2419');"><p>Harwin had the door when Ned returned to the Tower of the Hand. "Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse," Ned told him, too brusquely.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2419" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>奈德回到首相塔时，守门的是哈尔温。“叫乔里到我房间来，然后叫你爹帮我备好马鞍。”奈德告诉他，口气稍冲了点。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2420');"><p>"As you say, my lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2420" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是的，老爷。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2421');"><p>The Red Keep and the "Hand’s tourney" were chafing him raw, Ned reflected as he climbed. He yearned for the comfort of Catelyn’s arms, for the sounds of Robb and Jon crossing swords in the practice yard, for the cool days and cold nights of the north.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2421" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>红堡里的御前会议和这所谓“首相的比武大会”让他满心不耐，奈德边爬楼梯边想。此刻他好想念凯特琳的怀抱，想念罗柏和琼恩在场子里练剑的声音，想念北方的凉爽白昼和清寒冷夜。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2422');"><p>In his chambers he stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the book while he waited for Jory to arrive. The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descliptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children, by Grand Maester Malleon. Pycelle had spoken truly; it made for ponderous reading. Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it, and Ned felt certain he had reasons. There was something here, some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages, if only he could see it. But what? The tome was over a century old. Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born when Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings, births, and deaths.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2422" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>进房后他褪去重臣穿的正式丝衣，坐着看了会儿书，等待乔里。这本书全名是《七国主要贵族之世家谱系与历史（内附关于许多爵爷夫人和他们子女的描述）》，由梅利恩国师所撰。派席尔说得没错，这东西还真是枯燥乏味。但琼恩•艾林既然找来读了，奈德相信必有其原因。在这些泛黄的脆弱书页间，肯定埋藏着重要的线索，问题只在于他是否能钻研出其中深意。那究竟是什么呢？这本书册的历史已经超过百年。当梅利恩收集这份蒙尘的婚丧喜庆清单时，目前活在世上的人几乎都还没出生呢。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2423');"><p>He opened to the section on House Lannister once more, and turned the pages slowly, hoping against hope that something would leap out at him. The Lannisters were an old family, tracing their descent back to Lann the Clever, a trickster from the Age of Heroes who was no doubt as legendary as Bran the Builder, though far more beloved of singers and taletellers. In the songs, Lann was the fellow who winkled the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock with no weapon but his wits, and stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair. Ned wished he were here now, to winkle the truth out of this damnable book.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2423" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他再度翻到兰尼斯特家族的部分，刻意慢慢翻页，虽然明知不可能，却仍希望藉此灵光乍现。兰尼斯特家族历史悠久，向上可以追溯到英雄纪元时的骗术高手“机灵的”兰尼。他和“筑城者”布兰登一样同富传奇色彩，却更受歌手和说书人的爱戴。歌谣中的兰尼不靠刀剑，光凭他的机臹就把凯斯德利家族赶出凯岩城，又从太阳那里偷来黄金为他的卷发增光。奈德真希望他此刻就在自己身边，帮他把书中那该死的秘密赶出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2424');"><p>A sharp rap on the door heralded Jory Cassel. Ned closed Malleon’s tome and bid him enter. "I’ve promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done," he told him. "I rely on you to make the choice. Give Alyn the command, and make certain the men understand that they are needed to stop fights, not start them." Rising, Ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic. "Did you find the stableboy?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2424" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>一阵急促的敲门声宣告了乔里•凯索的到来。奈德阖上梅利恩的巨着，传他进来。“我答应从我的卫队里抽二十个人给都城守卫队，直到比武大会结束。”他告诉他，“挑人的事就交给你。让埃林领队，但务必让他们明白，首要任务是平息纷争，而非臸造冲突。”奈德起身，打开雪松木箱，拿出一件轻臸亚麻布上衣。“找到那个马僮了吗？”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2425');"><p>"The watchman, my lord," Jory said. "He vows he’ll never touch another horse."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2425" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“老爷，您说的这个都城守卫，”乔里道，“他发誓这辈子再也不碰别的马了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2426');"><p>"What did he have to say?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2426" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“为什么？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2427');"><p>"He claims he knew Lord Arryn well. Fast friends, they were." Jory snorted. "The Hand always gave the lads a copper on their name days, he says. Had a way with horses. Never rode his mounts too hard, and brought them carrots and apples, so they were always pleased to see him."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2427" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他说自己很了解艾林大人，说什么两人一拍即合。”乔里哼了一声，“他说每逢小伙子们命名日，首相大人总不忘赏几个小钱。还说首相大人熟悉马性，从不让坐骑过分劳累，还每每带胡萝卜和苹果给马儿吃，所以它们都很喜欢他。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2428');"><p>"Carrots and apples," Ned repeated. It sounded as if this boy would be even less use than the others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. Jory had spoken to each of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative, and arrogant as only a new-made knight can be. If the Hand wished to talk to him, he should be pleased to receive him, but he would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards?.?.?.?even if said captain was ten years older and a hundred times the swordsman. The serving girl had at least been pleasant. She said Lord Jon had been reading more than was good for him, that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son’s frailty, and gruff with his lady wife. The potboy, now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with Lord Jon, but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling with the king, the lord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on Dragonstone, the lord had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds, the lord had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate, wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl moon on the breast. The king’s own brother had gone with him to help choose the design, the potboy said. No, not Lord Renly, the other one, Lord Stannis.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2428" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“胡萝卜和苹果。”奈德跟着念了一辫。听起来这小子能帮上的忙比其他几个人还要有限，而他已经是小指头所说那四人之中最后的一个了。乔里和每个人都分别谈过。修夫爵士脾气火爆，不肯多说，刚当上骑士就已经很骄傲。照他的话，倘若首相大人有意和他谈谈，他很乐于接见，但区区一个侍卫队长可没资格盘问他……就算这个侍卫队长大他十岁，剑术强他一百倍也没戏。那个厨房小妹总算还好沟通，她说琼恩大人读书读过头啦，还说他为小儿子的孱弱病体伤神担忧，对夫人又很粗暴。至于那个现在靠拉车维生的跑堂小厮，则从来没跟琼恩大人说过话。不过他倒是知道一堆厨房里的闲话：听说老爷近来常跟国王吵架，老爷嫌东西不好吃，老爷打算送他儿子到龙石岛当养子，老爷对养猎犬突然有了兴趣，老爷去找了个高明的武器师傅，委托他打造一副全新的铠甲，整件镀上白银，胸前安上一只蓝玉雕的猎鹰和珍珠母做的月亮。跑堂小弟说，是国王的弟弟亲自陪他去挑选材料和花样，喔不，不是蓝礼大人，是另外那个，史坦尼斯大人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2429');"><p>"Did our watchman recall anything else of note?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2429" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这守卫有没有提到什么值得留意的事？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2430');"><p>"The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age. Often went riding with Lord Stannis, he says."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2430" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小伙子发誓说琼恩大人同年纪小他一半的人一样健壮，还常跟史坦尼斯大人外出骑马。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2431');"><p>Stannis again, Ned thought. He found that curious. Jon Arryn and he had been cordial, but never friendly. And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed himself to Dragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brother’s name. He had given no word as to when he might return. "Where did they go on these rides?" Ned asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2431" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>又是史坦尼斯，奈德心想。这可奇了，琼恩•艾林和他固然礼尚往来，却从不亲近。当劳勃北访临冬城时，史坦尼斯也躲回了龙石岛——那座多年前他以哥哥的名义，从坦格利安家族手中夺来的海岛要塞——并只字未提何时归来。“他们都骑马上哪儿？”奈德问。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2432');"><p>"The boy says that they visited a brothel."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2432" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“那小子说上妓院去。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2433');"><p>"A brothel?" Ned said. "The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis Baratheon?" He shook his head, incredulous, wondering what Lord Renly would make of this tidbit. Robert’s lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm, but Stannis was a different sort of man; a bare year younger than the king, yet utterly unlike him, stern, humorless, unforgiving, grim in his sense of duty.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2433" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“上妓院？”奈德道，“鹰巢城公爵、御前首相和史坦尼斯•拜拉席恩一起上妓院？”他难以置信地摇头，心里暗想要是蓝礼大人听了不知会作何反应。劳勃性好渔色举国皆知，成天有人拿来编歌取笑，但史坦尼斯可不一样。他虽只比国王小一岁，个性却是天壤之别：严峻、缺乏幽默感，从不轻易宽恕他人，重视责任到几近冷酷的地步。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2434');"><p>"The boy insists it’s true. The Hand took three guardsmen with him, and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2434" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小伙子坚持说这是真的。首相大人随身带了三个侍卫，小伙子说事后帮他们牵马时，听见他们拿这事开玩笑。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2435');"><p>"Which brothel?" Ned asked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2435" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是哪家妓院？”奈德问。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2436');"><p>"The boy did not know. The guards would."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2436" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小伙子也不知道，那几个侍卫应该知道。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2437');"><p>"A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale," Ned said dryly. "The gods are doing their best to vex us.Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannis?.?.?.?everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2437" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“只可惜莱莎把他们都带回艾林谷去了。”奈德干涩地说，“诸神真是想尽办法阻挠我们。莱莎夫人、柯蒙学士，还有史坦尼斯大人……每一个可能知道真相的人都在千里之外。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2438');"><p>"Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2438" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“您要不要把史坦尼斯大人从龙石岛给召回来？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2439');"><p>"Not yet," Ned said. "Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands." The matter nagged at him. Why did Stannis leave? Had he played some part in Jon Arryn’s murder? Or was he afraid? Ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon, who had once held Storm’s End through a year of siege, surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne sat outside with their hosts, banqueting in sight of his walls.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2439" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“还不是时候，”奈德道，“等我进一步了解内情，并弄清楚他站在哪一边再说。”这事真教他心烦。史坦尼斯为何离开？难道谋害琼恩•艾林他也有份？难道他在害怕？奈德很难想像有什么能吓住史坦尼斯•拜拉席恩，当年他曾坚守风息堡长达一年之久，到最后提利尔公爵和雷德温伯爵的军队围在城外，成天饮酒作乐，城里却只能靠吃老鼠肉和鞋皮支撑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2440');"><p>"Bring me my doublet, if you would. The grey, with the direwolf sigil. I want this armorer to know who I am. It might make him more forthcoming."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2440" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“麻烦你帮我把背心拿来，就灰色有冰原狼饰样的那件。我要让这个武器师傅知道我是谁，这样他或许会比较容易开口。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2441');"><p>Jory went to the wardrobe. "Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2441" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔里走到衣橱边。“蓝礼大人也是国王和史坦尼斯大人的弟弟。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2442');"><p>"Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides." Ned was not sure what to make of Renly, with all his friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days past, he had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite rose gold locklet. Inside was a miniature painted in the vivid Myrish style, of a lovely young girl with doe’s eyes and a cascade of soft brown hair. Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of anyone, and when Ned had no answer but a shrug, he had seemed disappointed. The maid was Loras Tyrell’s sister Margaery, he’d confessed, but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna. "No," Ned had told him, bemused. Could it be that Lord Renly, who looked so like a young Robert, had conceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young Lyanna? That struck him as more than passing queer.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2442" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“但他们骑马却没找他作伴，”虽然蓝礼态度友善又笑口常开，奈德仍旧摸不清他的立场。前几天，他把奈德拉到一边，向他展示一个精雕细琢的黄金玫瑰坠子，里面有张密尔画风的鲜活肖像，画中人是个生着雌鹿般眸子和一头柔软棕发的可爱少女。蓝礼似乎急于知道女孩是否让他联想起什么人，当奈德答不上来，只耸了耸肩时，他似乎相当失望。女孩是洛拉斯•提利尔的妹妹玛格丽，后来他坦承，不过有人说她长得像莱安娜。“不像啊。”奈德困惑地告诉他。难道说长得像劳勃年轻时的蓝礼，暗中爱慕着这位在他看来长得像年轻的莱安娜的女孩？真是怪事一桩。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2443');"><p>Jory held out the doublet, and Ned slid his hands through the armholes. "Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Robert’s tourney," he said as Jory laced the garment up the back.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2443" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>乔里递过背心，奈德把手穿进臂口。“或许史坦尼斯大人会回来参加劳勃的比武大会。”他边说边让乔里替他将衣服带子在后腰处系上结。

Elsewhere, two ragged boys no older than Bran were dueling with sticks, to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of others. An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops on the heads of the combatants. In the shadow of the wall, farmers stood beside their wagons, bellowing out, "Apples, the best apples, cheap at twice the price," and "Blood melons, sweet as honey," and "Turnips, onions, roots, here you go here, here you go, turnips, onions, roots, here you go here."

The first rider through the gate carried a long black banner. The silk rippled in the wind like a living thing; across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning. "Make way for Lord Beric!" the rider shouted. "Make way for Lord Beric!"

The farther they climbed, the larger the buildings grew. The man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill, in a huge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street. The double doors showed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood.

"If you are in need of new arms for the Hand’s tourney, you have come to the right shop." Ned did not bother to correct him.

The Knight of Flowers bought all his armor here, Tobho boasted, and many high lords, the ones who knew fine steel, and even Lord Renly, the king’s own brother. Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly’s new armor, the green plate with the golden antlers? No other armorer in the city could get that deep a green; he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself, paint and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman. Or mayhaps the Hand wanted a blade? Tobho had learned to work Valyrian steel at the forges of Qohor as a boy. Only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge them anew. "The direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, is it not? I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street," he vowed.
