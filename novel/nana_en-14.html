</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2858');"><p>Nana suddenly disappeared. It was a fresh plunge, an escapade, a flight into barbarous regions. Before her departure she had treated herself to a new sensation: she had held a sale and had made a clean sweep of everything—house, furniture, jewelry, nay, even dresses and linen. Prices were cited—the five days' sale produced more than six hundred thousand francs. For the last time Paris had seen her in a fairy piece. It was called Melusine, and it played at the Theatre de la Gaite, which the penniless Bordenave had taken out of sheer audacity. Here she again found herself in company with Prulliere and Fontan. Her part was simply spectacular, but it was the great attraction of the piece, consisting, as it did, of three POSES PLASTIQUES, each of which represented the same dumb and puissant fairy. Then one fine morning amid his grand success, when Bordenave, who was mad after advertisement, kept firing the Parisian imagination with colossal posters, it became known that she must have started for Cairo the previous day. She had simply had a few words with her manager. Something had been said which did not please her; the whole thing was the caprice of a woman who is too rich to let herself be annoyed. Besides, she had indulged an old infatuation, for she had long meditated visiting the Turks.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2858" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>娜娜突然失踪了。她又一次溜走，离家出走，飞往异国他乡了。临行前，她心血来潮，搞了一次大拍卖，把公馆、家具、首饰，甚至化妆品和衣物卖得精光。据说，五项拍卖共得六十多万法郎。巴黎人最后一次见到她，是在快乐剧院上演的一出名叫《仙女梅侣茜娜》的幻梦剧里，这出戏是一文不名的博尔德纳夫大胆推出的。这次她又与普律利埃尔和丰唐同台演出，她扮演的虽是一个普通哑角，一个健壮、不说话的仙女，却是戏中最精彩的部分，她在剧中只做了三个造型姿势。这次演出获得了巨大成功，正当一向对宣传感兴趣的博尔德纳夫张贴许多巨幅海报，向巴黎大肆宣传这出戏的时候，一天早上，有人获悉她大概于前一天离开了巴黎，到开罗去了。出走原因是因为她听了经理博尔德纳夫一句逆耳的话，同他发生了口角，这个任性、太富有的女人，忍受不了这口气，一气之下便走了。而且，这次她如愿以偿，因为她早就梦想到土耳其去走一趟。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2859');"><p>Months passed—she began to be forgotten. When her name was mentioned among the ladies and gentlemen, the strangest stories were told, and everybody gave the most contradictory and at the same time prodigious information. She had made a conquest of the viceroy; she was reigning, in the recesses of a palace, over two hundred slaves whose heads she now and then cut off for the sake of a little amusement. No, not at all! She had ruined herself with a great big nigger! A filthy passion this, which had left her wallowing without a chemise to her back in the crapulous debauchery of Cairo. A fortnight later much astonishment was produced when someone swore to having met her in Russia. A legend began to be formed: she was the mistress of a prince, and her diamonds were mentioned. All the women were soon acquainted with them from the current descriptions, but nobody could cite the precise source of all this information. There were finger rings, earrings, bracelets, a REVIERE of phenomenal width, a queenly diadem surmounted by a central brilliant the size of one's thumb. In the retirement of those faraway countries she began to gleam forth as mysteriously as a gem-laden idol. People now mentioned her without laughing, for they were full of meditative respect for this fortune acquired among the barbarians.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2859" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>几个月过去了，大家把娜娜渐渐淡忘了。当这些先生们和太太们又提起她时，种种离奇的传说不胫而走，众说纷纭，这些消息互相矛盾而又不可思议。有人说总督迷恋上了她，她住在深宫里，奴役着两百个奴隶，她还时常砍奴隶的头，以此取乐。也有人说，情况根本不是这样，她同一个身材高大的黑人鬼混，肮脏的热恋把她弄得钱财殆尽，连穿的衣服也没有，在开罗过着放荡的生活。过了两个星期，又传来了有关她惊人的消息，有人发誓说在俄国见到过她。于是这条消息逐渐变成了传说，说她成了一个王子的情妇，她拥有很多珠宝钻石，尽管谁也不知道消息的确切来源。时隔不久，女人们从不胫而走的绘声绘色的描写中，竟对那些珠宝钻石了解得一清二楚。她们说她有戒指，有耳环，有手镯，有一条两指宽的项链，还有一顶王后的冠冕，冠冕中央镶着一颗璀璨的钻石，足有大拇指那么宽。她虽然远走到这些异国他乡，依然像一尊饰满珠宝首饰的偶像，放射着神秘的光芒。现在人们提到她的名字时，都一本正经，带着几分敬意，对她在蛮族人那里发了迹感到迷惑不解。

Lucy called her and at once burst out with:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2861');"><p>"Have you dined? Are you disengaged? Oh, then come with me, my dear. Nana's back."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2861" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你吃过晚饭了吗？现在有空吗？……那么，亲爱的，跟我一道走吧……娜娜回来啦。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2862');"><p>The other got in at once, and Lucy continued:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2862" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>卡罗利娜随即上了马车，吕西继续说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2863');"><p>"And you know, my dear, she may be dead while we're gossiping."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2863" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你知道，亲爱的，我们现在在这里谈话时，也许她已经死了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2864');"><p>"Dead! What an idea!" cried Caroline in stupefaction. "And where is she? And what's it of?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2864" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她死了！你胡说什么！”卡罗利娜听了惊愕不已，大声嚷道，“她在哪里？怎么死的？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2865');"><p>"At the Grand Hotel, of smallpox. Oh, it's a long story!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2865" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她在格朗旅馆……是出天花……啊！说来真是一言难尽啊。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2866');"><p>Lucy had bidden her coachman drive fast, and while the horses trotted rapidly along the Rue Royale and the boulevards, she told what had happened to Nana in jerky, breathless sentences.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2866" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>吕西叫车夫策马快奔。于是，马急速跑起来，马车驶过王家大道和几条林荫大道，一路上，她用断断续续的语句，一口气讲述了娜娜的情况。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2867');"><p>"You can't imagine it. Nana plumps down out of Russia. I don't know why—some dispute with her prince. She leaves her traps at the station; she lands at her aunt's—you remember the old thing. Well, and then she finds her baby dying of smallpox. The baby dies next day, and she has a row with the aunt about some money she ought to have sent, of which the other one has never seen a sou. Seems the child died of that: in fact, it was neglected and badly cared for. Very well; Nana slopes, goes to a hotel, then meets Mignon just as she was thinking of her traps. She has all sorts of queer feelings, shivers, wants to be sick, and Mignon takes her back to her place and promises to look after her affairs. Isn't it odd, eh? Doesn't it all happen pat? But this is the best part of the story: Rose finds out about Nana's illness and gets indignant at the idea of her being alone in furnished apartments. So she rushes off, crying, to look after her. You remember how they used to detest one another—like regular furies! Well then, my dear, Rose has had Nana transported to the Grand Hotel, so that she should, at any rate, die in a smart place, and now she's already passed three nights there and is free to die of it after. It's Labordette who told me all about it. Accordingly I wanted to see for myself—"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2867" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你真不会想到……娜娜从俄国回来了，我也不知道为什么，大概与她的王子吵了架……她把行里存放在火车站，跑到她姑妈家里，你还记得吗，就是那个老太婆……她刚到姑妈家里，就一下子扑到患天花的孩子身上。第二天，孩子就死了，她同姑妈大吵了一顿，她大概给姑妈寄过钱，但姑妈不曾收到一个子儿……娜娜认为孩子是因为没有钱治才死的；总之，这孩子被她丢下了，又无人照料……好啦！她跑到一家旅馆，刚想去取行李时，遇见了米尼翁……她突然感觉浑身不舒服，打起寒噤，想呕吐，米尼翁领她回到房间，并答应去替她取行李……嗯？这事说来真怪！难道他们是事先约定好的！可是还有更妙的事呢：罗丝得知娜娜生了病，孤身一人呆在带出租家具的房间后，感到很难过，赶紧跑去照料她，不为她伤心流泪呢……曾记得她们过去互相敌视，是一对冤家对头！可是，这一次罗丝却找人把她抬到格朗旅馆里，心想即使她死了，也要死在一个像样的地方，娜娜在那里已经住了三天了，现在正在等死……这些都是拉博德特告诉我的，我想去看看她……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2868');"><p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Caroline in great excitement "We'll go up to her."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2868" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你说得对，你说得对，”卡罗利娜听了心情很不平静，打断她的话，说道，“我们一起上楼去看看她吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2869');"><p>They had arrived at their destination. On the boulevard the coachman had had to rein in his horses amid a block of carriages and people on foot. During the day the Corps Legislatif had voted for war, and now a crowd was streaming down all the streets, flowing along all the pavements, invading the middle of the roadway. Beyond the Madeleine the sun had set behind a blood-red cloud, which cast a reflection as of a great fire and set the lofty windows flaming. Twilight was falling, and the hour was oppressively melancholy, for now the avenues were darkening away into the distance but were not as yet dotted over by the bright sparks of the gas lamps. And among the marching crowds distant voices swelled and grew ever louder, and eyes gleamed from pale faces, while a great spreading wind of anguish and stupor set every head whirling.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2869" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她们到达了目的地。林荫大道被车辆和行人堵得水泄不通，车夫只好勒住马。白天，立法议会表决通过了向普鲁士宣战的决议，现在民众从四面八方拥来，他们走在人行道上，渐渐又蔓及车行道。在圣玛德莱娜教堂那边，夕阳已隐没在一片血红的云彩后面，余晖把高高的窗户映得火红。夜幕降临了，此时此刻多么令人沉闷，又多么令人惆怅，暮色越发变浓了，条条街道笼罩在一片黑暗之中，煤气路灯还没有发出熠熠光芒。在这些向前进发的人群中，说话声由远及近，人们个个面色苍白，目光炯炯，忧虑和惊愕犹如一阵狂风袭来，人人惊慌失措。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2870');"><p>"Here's Mignon," said Lucy. "He'll give us news."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2870" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“米尼翁在这里，”吕西说道，“他会告诉我们娜娜的病情的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2871');"><p>Mignon was standing under the vast porch of the Grand Hotel. He looked nervous and was gazing at the crowd. After Lucy's first few questions he grew impatient and cried out:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2871" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>米尼翁正站在格朗旅馆的宽阔门廊下，神色紧张地注视着街上的人群。吕西刚开口问他，他就恼火了，大声说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2872');"><p>"How should I know? These last two days I haven't been able to tear Rose away from up there. It's getting stupid, when all's said, for her to be risking her life like that! She'll be charming if she gets over it, with holes in her face! It'll suit us to a tee!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2872" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我怎么会知道呢！罗丝呆在楼上已经两天了，我怎么叫她，她也不肯下来……她简直是把自己的生命孤注一掷，总之，这样做是愚蠢的！如果她传染上天花，弄成一张麻脸，我们就遭殃了！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2873');"><p>The idea that Rose might lose her beauty was exasperating him. He was giving up Nana in the most downright fashion, and he could not in the least understand these stupid feminine devotions. But Fauchery was crossing the boulevard, and he, too, came up anxiously and asked for news. The two men egged each other on. They addressed one another familiarly in these days.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2873" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他一想到罗丝会失去她的花容月貌，心里就怄气。他干脆撂下娜娜不管，而女人们却愚蠢地尽心竭力去照顾别人，他真是百思不得其解。米尼翁刚到，福什利也穿过马路，向他这里走来，他对娜娜也放心不下，来看看她的病情怎样。他俩你推我上楼，我推你上楼，谁也不肯自己上去，现在他们说起话来，互相都用亲昵的称呼。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2874');"><p>"Always the same business, my sonny," declared Mignon. "You ought to go upstairs; you would force her to follow you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2874" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“什么都是老样子，老弟，”米尼翁说，“你应该上楼把罗丝硬拉下来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2875');"><p>"Come now, you're kind, you are!" said the journalist. "Why don't you go upstairs yourself?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2875" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哟！你真善良！该你上去！”新闻记者说道，“你自己为什么不上去呢？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2876');"><p>Then as Lucy began asking for Nana's number, they besought her to make Rose come down; otherwise they would end by getting angry.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2876" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这时，吕西问他们娜娜住在哪个房间，他们便央求她，请她叫罗丝下来，说如果罗丝不下来，他们就要发火了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2877');"><p>Nevertheless, Lucy and Caroline did not go up at once. They had caught sight of Fontan strolling about with his hands in his pockets and greatly amused by the quaint expressions of the mob. When he became aware that Nana was lying ill upstairs he affected sentiment and remarked:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2877" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>然而，吕西和卡罗利娜并未立刻上楼。她们瞥见丰唐两只手插在口袋里，正在马路上闲逛，饶有兴趣地注视着街上行人的一张张古怪面孔。他知道娜娜病倒在楼上后，装出一副同情的神态，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2878');"><p>"The poor girl! I'll go and shake her by the hand. What's the matter with her, eh?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2878" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可怜的姑娘！……我要上楼去同她握握手……她得了什么病？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2879');"><p>"Smallpox," replied Mignon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2879" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她得的是天花。”米尼翁回答道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2880');"><p>The actor had already taken a step or two in the direction of the court, but he came back and simply murmured with a shiver:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2880" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丰唐原本已向院子迈了一步，但随即又退了回来。他打了一个哆嗦，嘴里咕噜道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2881');"><p>"Oh, damn it!"
</p></origin><translate id="div_2881" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哎哟！我的天哪！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2882');"><p>The smallpox was no joke. Fontan had been near having it when he was five years old, while Mignon gave them an account of one of his nieces who had died of it. As to Fauchery, he could speak of it from personal experience, for he still bore marks of it in the shape of three little lumps at the base of his nose, which he showed them. And when Mignon again egged him on to the ascent, on the pretext that you never had it twice, he violently combated this theory and with infinite abuse of the doctors instanced various cases. But Lucy and Caroline interrupted them, for the growing multitude filled them with astonishment.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2882" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>天花可非同小可。丰唐五岁时就差点儿染上天花。米尼翁说，他有一个侄子就是得了天花死的。说到天花，福什利更有发言权，他自己就得过天花，如今鼻根处还留下三个麻点呢，他还把麻点指给大家看。米尼翁这时又推他上楼，说一个人不会得两次天花的。福什利却严厉驳斥他的谬论，他列举了许多人第二次生天花的例子，说医生们啥也不懂。这会儿吕西见街上行人越来越多，便截住他们的话，说道： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2883');"><p>"Just look! Just look what a lot of people!" The night was deepening, and in the distance the gas lamps were being lit one by one. Meanwhile interested spectators became visible at windows, while under the trees the human flood grew every minute more dense, till it ran in one enormous stream from the Madeleine to the Bastille. Carriages rolled slowly along. A roaring sound went up from this compact and as yet inarticulate mass. Each member of it had come out, impelled by the desire to form a crowd, and was now trampling along, steeping himself in the pervading fever. But a great movement caused the mob to flow asunder. Among the jostling, scattering groups a band of men in workmen's caps and white blouses had come in sight, uttering a rhythmical cry which suggested the beat of hammers upon an anvil.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2883" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“看呀！看呀！人越来越多了。” 暮色越发浓了，远处的煤气路灯接二连三亮起来。这时呆在窗口看热闹的人隐约可见，树下的人流每时每刻都在增加，从圣玛德莱娜教堂一直到巴士底狱，汇合成一条巨大的人流。马车都徐徐行驶着。在这密密麻麻的人群中，不时发出嗡嗡的声音，还有人发出吼叫声，大家都是为了加入群众行列，步行来到这里的，个个情绪激昂。这时，人群中突然一阵骚动，人群连忙往后退了退。在推推搡搡中，人群向两边闪出一条路来，一队头戴鸭舌帽、身穿白工装的人出现了，他们有节奏地呼喊着口号，那喊声酷似铁锤落在铁砧上的声音： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2884');"><p>"To Ber-lin! To Ber-lin! To Ber-lin!" And the crowd stared in gloomy distrust yet felt themselves already possessed and inspired by heroic imaginings, as though a military band were passing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2884" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“进军柏林！进军柏林！进军柏林！” 群众带着沮丧和不信任的神情瞅着他们，不过他们已经受到这种激昂情绪的感染和激励，就像看见一支军乐队经过似的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2885');"><p>"Oh yes, go and get your throats cut!" muttered Mignon, overcome by an access of philosophy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2885" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“好吧，好吧，让你们去战场上丢脑袋吧！”米尼翁很激动，用哲学家的达观口吻，嘟哝了一句。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2886');"><p>But Fontan thought it very fine, indeed, and spoke of enlisting. When the enemy was on the frontier all citizens ought to rise up in defense of the fatherland! And with that he assumed an attitude suggestive of Bonaparte at Austerlitz.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2886" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>丰唐却认为这样行动很好。他说自己也要参军上前线。敌人已经打到边境线上了，全体公民都应该起来保卫祖国。他说话的姿势颇像拿破仑在奥斯特利茨①发表演说时的姿势。  
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2887');"><p>"Look here, are you coming up with us?" Lucy asked him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2887" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“喂！你同我们一起上楼吗？” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2888');"><p>"Oh dear, no! To catch something horrid?" he said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2888" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“哦！我才不上去呢，”丰唐回答道，“上去会染上天花的！” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2889');"><p>On a bench in front of the Grand Hotel a man sat hiding his face in a handkerchief. On arriving Fauchery had indicated him to Mignon with a wink of the eye. Well, he was still there; yes, he was always there. And the journalist detained the two women also in order to point him out to them. When the man lifted his head they recognized him; an exclamation escaped them. It was the Count Muffat, and he was giving an upward glance at one of the windows.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2889" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>在格朗旅馆的门前，有一个男子坐在一条长凳上，用手绢掩住面孔。福什利一到这里，就向米尼翁眨眨眼睛，示意要他留心那个人。那个人一直坐在那儿，是的，他未挪动一步。新闻记者叫住两个女人，指着那个人叫他们看。当那人抬起头来时，她们辨认出他来了，两人不禁惊叫了一声。原来他是缪法伯爵，他仰着头，凝视着楼上的一扇窗户。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2890');"><p>"You know, he's been waiting there since this morning," Mignon informed them. "I saw him at six o'clock, and he hasn't moved since. Directly Labordette spoke about it he came there with his handkerchief up to his face. Every half-hour he comes dragging himself to where we're standing to ask if the person upstairs is doing better, and then he goes back and sits down. Hang it, that room isn't healthy! It's all very well being fond of people, but one doesn't want to kick the bucket."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2890" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你们知道吧，他从清早就呆在这里了，”米尼翁说道，“六点钟时我就看见他了，他没有走动一步……拉博德特刚告诉他这个消息，他就来了，他用手绢掩住面孔……每隔半个钟头，就迈着沉重的步伐走过来，询问楼上那个人的病是否好了一些，然后又回到原来的地方坐下来……当然罗！那个房间里不卫生，一个人不管怎样爱别人，也不至于想寻死吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2891');"><p>The count sat with uplifted eyes and did not seem conscious of what was going on around him. Doubtless he was ignorant of the declaration of war, and he neither felt nor saw the crowd.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2891" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵抬头望着楼上，似乎还未注意到周围发生的事。大概他还不知道宣战这件事，仿佛还没有发现自己周围有许多人，也没有听见人群中的喧嚣声。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2892');"><p>"Look, here he comes!" said Fauchery. "Now you'll see."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2892" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“瞧！”福什利说道，“他站起来了，你们看他往哪儿走。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2893');"><p>The count had, in fact, quitted his bench and was entering the lofty porch. But the porter, who was getting to know his face at last, did not give him time to put his question. He said sharply:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2893" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>伯爵果然离开了长凳走到高大的门脚下。门房终于认出他来，还没等到他开口，门房就直截了当地告诉他： 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2894');"><p>"She's dead, monsieur, this very minute."
</p></origin><translate id="div_2894" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“先生，她已经死了，是刚刚死的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2895');"><p>Nana dead! It was a blow to them all. Without a word Muffat had gone back to the bench, his face still buried in his handkerchief. The others burst into exclamations, but they were cut short, for a fresh band passed by, howling, "A BERLIN! A BERLIN! A BERLIN!" Nana dead! Hang it, and such a fine girl too! Mignon sighed and looked relieved, for at last Rose would come down. A chill fell on the company. Fontan, meditating a tragic role, had assumed a look of woe and was drawing down the corners of his mouth and rolling his eyes askance, while Fauchery chewed his cigar nervously, for despite his cheap journalistic chaff he was really touched. Nevertheless, the two women continued to give vent to their feelings of surprise. The last time Lucy had seen her was at the Gaite; Blanche, too, had seen her in Melusine. Oh, how stunning it was, my dear, when she appeared in the depths of the crystal grot! The gentlemen remembered the occasion perfectly. Fontan had played the Prince Cocorico. And their memories once stirred up, they launched into interminable particulars. How ripping she looked with that rich coloring of hers in the crystal grot! Didn't she, now? She didn't say a word: the authors had even deprived her of a line or two, because it was superfluous. No, never a word! It was grander that way, and she drove her public wild by simply showing herself. You wouldn't find another body like hers! Such shoulders as she had, and such legs and such a figure! Strange that she should be dead! You know, above her tights she had nothing on but a golden girdle which hardly concealed her behind and in front. All round her the grotto, which was entirely of glass, shone like day. Cascades of diamonds were flowing down; strings of brilliant pearls glistened among the stalactites in the vault overhead, and amid the transparent atmosphere and flowing fountain water, which was crossed by a wide ray of electric light, she gleamed like the sun with that flamelike skin and hair of hers. Paris would always picture her thus—would see her shining high up among crystal glass like the good God Himself. No, it was too stupid to let herself die under such conditions! She must be looking pretty by this time in that room up there!

In the bright light thrown from shop-windows and beneath the wavering glare of the gas two living streams were distinguishable as they flowed along the pavement, innumerable hats apparently drifting on their surface.

A constant forward movement seemed to sweep the roadway, and the cry kept recurring; obstinately, abruptly, there rang from thousands of throats:

Then the door opened slowly, and Lucy entered, followed by Caroline and Blanche. But they stopped directly; there were already five women in the room; Gaga was lying back in the solitary armchair, which was a red velvet Voltaire. In front of the fireplace Simonne and Clarisse were now standing talking to Lea de Horn, who was seated, while by the bed, to the left of the door, Rose Mignon, perched on the edge of a chest, sat gazing fixedly at the body where it lay hidden in the shadow of the curtains. All the others had their hats and gloves on and looked as if they were paying a call: she alone sat there with bare hands and untidy hair and cheeks rendered pale by three nights of watching. She felt stupid in the face of this sudden death, and her eyes were swollen with weeping. A shaded lamp standing on the corner of the chest of drawers threw a bright flood of light over Gaga.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2914');"><p>Then she once more lapsed into contemplation and neither moved nor spoke. Perhaps they would be able to look at her presently! And with that the three women joined the others in front of the fireplace. Simonne and Clarisse were discussing the dead woman's diamonds in low tones. Well, did they really exist—those diamonds? Nobody had seen them; it must be a bit of humbug. But Lea de Horn knew someone who knew all about them. Oh, they were monster stones! Besides, they weren't all; she had brought back lots of other precious property from Russia—embroidered stuffs, for instance, valuable knickknacks, a gold dinner service, nay, even furniture. "Yes, my dear, fifty-two boxes, enormous cases some of them, three truckloads of them!" They were all lying at the station. "Wasn't it hard lines, eh?—to die without even having time to unpack one's traps?" Then she had a lot of tin, besides—something like a million! Lucy asked who was going to inherit it all. Oh, distant relations—the aunt, without doubt! It would be a pretty surprise for that old body. She knew nothing about it yet, for the sick woman had obstinately refused to let them warn her, for she still owed her a grudge over her little boy's death. Thereupon they were all moved to pity about the little boy, and they remembered seeing him at the races. Oh, it was a wretchedly sickly baby; it looked so old and so sad. In fact, it was one of those poor brats who never asked to be born!
</p></origin><translate id="div_2914" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>说完，她又陷入沉思之中，她一动不动，默不作声。过一会儿，大概可以看看娜娜了吧；三个女人走到壁炉边，同其他几个女人呆在一起。西蒙娜同克拉利瑟悄声议论起死者的钻石首饰。她到底有没有钻石，谁也不曾见过，也许有人扯谎。可是莱娅德霍恩认识的一个男子说见过那些钻石首饰，哦！一颗颗硕大无朋的钻石！何况还不止这些，她还从俄国带回来不少别的东西呢，如绣花衣料，贵重小玩艺，一套金餐具，甚至还有家具。确实，亲爱的，总共有五十二件行李，足足装了三车厢。这些东西都还留在火车站呢。唉！她真倒霉，还没有来得及打开行李就死了，据说，她还带回很多钱，大概足有一百万。吕西问谁来继承遗产，无疑由远房亲戚继承喽，肯定是她的姑妈，这个老太婆这下子倒交了好运。她还一点不知道呢，病人执意不让人告诉她，孩子死了，娜娜对她怀恨在心。于是大家都可怜起那个孩子，记得赛马时大家看见过他，那时他浑身是病，像被病魔缠身，老是愁眉不展，总之，他像一个不愿来到这个世上的孩子。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2917');"><p>In that gloomy room melancholy ideas began to take possession of their imaginations. They felt frightened. It was silly to stand talking so long, but a longing to see her kept them rooted to the spot. It was very hot—the lamp glass threw a round, moonlike patch of light upon the ceiling, but the rest of the room was drowned in steamy darkness. Under the bed a deep plate full of phenol exhaled an insipid smell. And every few moments tiny gusts of wind swelled the window curtains. The window opened on the boulevard, whence rose a dull roaring sound.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2917" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>房间里一派肃穆气氛，使她们不禁产生悲观的想法。于是，她们害怕起来，心想在这里聊了这么久，真有点傻，可是她们还想看看死者，所以谁也没有动弹一下。房间里很热，既潮湿又阴暗，灯光透过玻璃灯罩照在天花板上，宛若一轮明月。床底下有一只深底盘子，里面盛满了石炭酸，散发出一股淡淡的气味。临街窗户上的窗帘不时被风吹得鼓起来，街上传来低沉的轰轰隆隆的声音。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2924');"><p>Beneath these, again, a most amusing scene presented itself. The streams of people were discernible rolling torrentwise along the sidewalks and in the roadway, where there was a confused procession of carriages. Everywhere there were vast moving shadows in which lanterns and lampposts gleamed like sparks. But the band which now came roaring by carried torches, and a red glow streamed down from the direction of the Madeleine, crossed the mob like a trail of fire and spread out over the heads in the distance like a vivid reflection of a burning house. Lucy called Blanche and Caroline, forgetting where she was and shouting:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2926');"><p>They all three leaned out, greatly interested. The trees got in their way, and occasionally the torches disappeared under the foliage. They tried to catch a glimpse of the men of their own party below, but a protruding balcony hid the door, and they could only make out Count Muffat, who looked like a dark parcel thrown down on the bench where he sat. He was still burying his face in his handkerchief. A carriage had stopped in front, and yet another woman hurried up, in whom Lucy recognized Maria Blond. She was not alone; a stout man got down after her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2926" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她们三个人都俯下身子，兴致勃勃地往下看，街上的树木不时挡住她们的视线，火炬时隐时现。她们一心想看清楼下的几位先生，由于阳台遮住了旅馆的大门，她们总是只看见缪法伯爵，他用手绢捂住面孔，看上去像扔在长凳上的一团黑黝黝的东西。一辆马车在旅馆门口停一来，吕西认出走下马车的是玛丽亚布隆，这下又来了一个女人。她不是一个人来的，身后还跟着一个胖乎乎的男人。

They had come strolling thither in order to have a look at the boulevards, and they hailed one another and commented loudly on that poor girl's death. Then they began discussing politics and strategy. Bordenave, Daguenet, Labordette, Prulliere and others, besides, had swollen the group, and now they were all listening to Fontan, who was explaining his plan for taking Berlin within a week.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2934');"><p>Two more women arrived. These were Tatan Nene and Louise Violaine. They had been wandering about the Grand Hotel for twenty minutes past, bandied from waiter to waiter, and had ascended and descended more than thirty flights of stairs amid a perfect stampede of travelers who were hurrying to leave Paris amid the panic caused by the war and the excitement on the boulevards. Accordingly they just dropped down on chairs when they came in, for they were too tired to think about the dead. At that moment a loud noise came from the room next door, where people were pushing trunks about and striking against furniture to an accompaniment of strident, outlandish syllables. It was a young Austrian couple, and Gaga told how during her agony the neighbors had played a game of catch as catch can and how, as only an unused door divided the two rooms, they had heard them laughing and kissing when one or the other was caught.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2934" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>接着又来了两个女人，她们是塔唐内内和路易丝维奥莱纳。她们在格朗旅馆里跑遍了，找了二十分钟，打听一个茶房又一个茶房，上上下下跑了三十多层，遇到的人都是惊恐万状、迫不及待要离开巴黎的旅客，他们被战争和街上群众的激昂情绪吓得乱作一团。她俩一进门，便一下子倒在椅子上，她们太疲劳了，不能马上看死者。就在这时候，隔壁房间里传来一阵嘈杂声，有人在推箱子，敲家具，还听见说话的声音，说的是外话，每个音节都拉得长长的。他们是一对年轻的奥地利夫妇。加加说，娜娜快要断气时，他们正在追逐嬉戏，因为两个房间只隔一道封死的门，当一个人被另一个抓住时，还听见一阵笑声和接吻声。

Nevertheless, they began getting ready and gave their skirts various little pats. Lucy was again leaning out of window. She was alone now, and a sorrowful feeling began little by little to overpower her, as though an intense wave of melancholy had mounted up from the howling mob. Torches still kept passing, shaking out clouds of sparks, and far away in the distance the various bands stretched into the shadows, surging unquietly to and fro like flocks being driven to the slaughterhouse at night. A dizzy feeling emanated from these confused masses as the human flood rolled them along—a dizzy feeling, a sense of terror and all the pity of the massacres to come. The people were going wild; their voices broke; they were drunk with a fever of excitement which sent them rushing toward the unknown "out there" beyond the dark wall of the horizon.

The former told them that she had enjoyed the most roaring jolly good times with soldiers. Oh, they were good fellows and would have done any mortal thing for the girls. But as the ladies had raised their voices unduly Rose Mignon, still sitting on the chest by the bed, silenced them with a softly whispered "Hush!" They stood quite still at this and glanced obliquely toward the dead woman, as though this request for silence had emanated from the very shadows of the curtains. In the heavy, peaceful stillness which ensued, a void, deathly stillness which made them conscious of the stiff dead body lying stretched close by them, the cries of the mob burst forth:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2963');"><p>They all repeated this aspiration, and Blanche confessed that she burned candles for the emperor. Caroline had been smitten by him and for two whole months had walked where he was likely to pass but had failed to attract his attention.

</p></origin><translate id="div_2963" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>大家都重复她的话。布朗瑟还说她为皇上点蜡烛祈祷过。卡罗利娜由于一时热情高涨，曾经在皇上经过的地方来回游荡了两个月，但是没有引起皇上的注意。其他人都言辞激烈地一起攻击共和派，说应该把他们全部消灭在国境线上，好让拿破仑三世打败敌人后，安安稳稳地治理国家，让全国人民过上快乐的生活。

She was fruit of the charnel house, a heap of matter and blood, a shovelful of corrupted flesh thrown down on the pillow. The pustules had invaded the whole of the face, so that each touched its neighbor. Fading and sunken, they had assumed the grayish hue of mud; and on that formless pulp, where the features had ceased to be traceable, they already resembled some decaying damp from the grave. One eye, the left eye, had completely foundered among bubbling purulence, and the other, which remained half open, looked like a deep, black, ruinous hole. The nose was still suppurating. Quite a reddish crush was peeling from one of the cheeks and invading the mouth, which it distorted into a horrible grin. And over this loathsome and grotesque mask of death the hair, the beautiful hair, still blazed like sunlight and flowed downward in rippling gold. Venus was rotting. It seemed as though the poison she had assimilated in the gutters and on the carrion tolerated by the roadside, the leaven with which she had poisoned a whole people, had but now remounted to her face and turned it to corruption.
