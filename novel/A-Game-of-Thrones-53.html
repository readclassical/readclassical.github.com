</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4722');"><p>Othor," announced Ser Jaremy Rykker, "beyond a doubt. And this one was Jafer Flowers." He turned the corpse over with his foot, and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue, blue eyes. "They were Ben Stark’s men, both of them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4722" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这是奥瑟，”杰瑞米•莱克爵士宣布，“错不了。另外那个是杰佛•佛花。”他用脚把尸体翻过来，死尸脸色惨白，蓝澄澄的双眼睁得老大，瞪着阴霾不开的天空。“他们两个都是班•史塔克手下的人。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4723');"><p>My uncle’s men, Jon thought numbly. He remembered how he’d pleaded to ride with them. Gods, I was such a green boy. If he had taken me, it might be me lying here?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4723" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们是叔叔手下的人，琼恩木然地想。他忆起自己当初哀求与他们同去的模样。诸神保佑，我果真是个臻气未脱的孩子。假如叔叔带的是我，或许就换我躺在这儿了…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4724');"><p>Jafer’s right wrist ended in the ruin of torn flesh and splintered bone left by Ghost’s jaws. His right hand was floating in a jar of vinegar back in Maester Aemon’s tower. His left hand, still at the end of his arm, was as black as his cloak.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4724" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>杰佛的右臂被白灵齐腕咬断，末端只剩一团血肉模糊。他的右手掌此刻正在伊蒙师傅的塔里，悬浮于醋罐之中。至于他的左掌，虽然还好端端地接在臂膀上，却和他的斗篷一般黑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4725');"><p>"Gods have mercy," the Old Bear muttered. He swung down from his garron, handing his reins to Jon. The morning was unnaturally warm; beads of sweat dotted the Lord Commander’s broad forehead like dew on a melon. His horse was nervous, rolling her eyes, backing away from the dead men as far as her lead would allow. Jon led her off a few paces, fighting to keep her from bolting. The horses did not like the feel of this place. For that matter, neither did Jon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4725" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“诸神慈悲。”熊老喃喃道。他翻身从犁马背上跳下，把缰绳交给琼恩。这是个异常暖和的清晨，守夜人司令宽阔的额间辫布汗珠，犹如甜瓜表面的露水。他的坐骑十分局促，一边翻着白眼，一边扯着缰绳，想从死人身边退开。琼恩牵它走开几步，努力不让它挣脱奔走。马儿不喜欢此地的感觉，话说回来，琼恩自己也不喜欢。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4726');"><p>The dogs liked it least of all. Ghost had led the party here; the pack of hounds had been useless. When Bass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the severed hand, they had gone wild, yowling and barking, fighting to get away. Even now they were snarling and whimpering by turns, pulling at their leashes while Chett cursed them for curs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4726" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>狗们更是深恶痛绝。带领队伍到这儿的是白灵，整群猎犬根本毫无用处。之前驯兽长贝斯试着拿断手给它们闻，好让它们记住气味，结果狗群整个发狂，又吠又叫，拼死命要逃开。即便到现在，它们也依然时而咆哮时而哀嚎，用力拉扯狗链，齐特为此咒骂不已。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4727');"><p>It is only a wood, Jon told himself, and they’re only dead men. He had seen dead men before?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4727" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>这不过是座森林，狗儿闻到的只是尸臭罢了，琼恩这么告诉自己。他刚见过死人…… 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4728');"><p>Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had gone further than before. In the dark he’d heard the scrape of stone on stone. When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, his heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his deep sense of terror. He dared not go back to sleep. Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked, restless, until he saw the light of the dawn off to the cast. It was only a dream. I am a brother of the Night’s Watch now, not a frightened boy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4728" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>就在昨夜，他又作了那个临冬城的梦。梦中他漫游在空荡荡的城堡，四处寻找父亲，最后下楼梯进了墓窖。但这次梦境并未在此结束。在黑暗中他听见石头刮碰的声音，猛一转身，只见墓穴一个个打开来，死去已久的国王纷纷由冰冷黑暗的坟中蹒跚走出。琼恩恍然惊醒，四周一片漆黑，心脏狂跳。连白灵跳上床，用嘴巴摩擦他的脸，也难减轻他心中深深的恐惧。他不敢再睡，便起身爬上长城，不安地漫步，直到东方初绽曙光。那不过是梦而已，如今我是守夜人军团的一分子，不再是容易受惊的小孩儿了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4729');"><p>Samwell Tarly huddled beneath the trees, half-hidden behind the horses. His round fat face was the color of curdled milk. So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch, but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either. "I can’t look," he whispered miserably.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4729" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆威尔•塔利蜷缩树下，半躲在马群后。他那张圆胖的脸颜色有如酸败的牛奶。虽然他并未逃进森林上吐下泻，可也没正眼瞧过死尸。“我不敢看。”他可怜兮兮地低语。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4730');"><p>"You have to look," Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would not hear. "Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn’t he? What good are eyes if they’re shut?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4730" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你不能不看。”琼恩对他说，一边压低声音不让别人听见。“伊蒙师傅不是派你来当他的眼睛么?眼睛若是闭上了，还有什么用呢?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4731');"><p>"Yes, but?.?.?.?I’m such a coward, Jon."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4731" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“话是这样说，可……琼恩，我实在是个胆小鬼。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4732');"><p>Jon put a hand on Sam’s shoulder. "We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even Ghost. No one will hurt you, Sam. Go ahead and look. The first look is the hardest."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4732" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩把手放到山姆肩膀。“我们身边有十二个游骑兵，还有成群的猎狗，连白灵都跟来了。山姆，没人伤得了你。去看看罢，第一眼总是最难。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4733');"><p>Sam gave a tremulous nod, working up his courage with a visible effort. Slowly he swiveled his head. His eyes widened, but Jon held his arm so he could not turn away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4733" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆颤巍巍地点个头，很明显地努力鼓起勇气，然后缓缓转头。他的双眼顿时睁得老大，但琼恩抓住他的手，不让他转开。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4734');"><p>"Ser Jaremy," the Old Bear asked gruffly, "Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall. Where are the others?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4734" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“杰瑞米爵士，”熊老没好气地问，“班•史塔克出长城带了六个人，其他人上哪儿去了?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4735');"><p>Ser Jaremy shook his head. "Would that I knew."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4735" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>杰瑞米爵士摇摇头。“我若是知道就好了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4736');"><p>Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer. "Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw nothing. Is this what the Night’s Watch has fallen to? Do we still sweep these woods?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4736" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙对这答案显然大为不满。“两个弟兄几乎在长城的肉眼可见范围内惨遭杀害，你的游骑兵却什么也没听见，什么也没看到，难道守夜人已经怠惰到这种地步了?我们到底有没有派人扫荡森林? ”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4737');"><p>"Yes, my lord, but..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4737" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“当然是有的，大人，可是——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4738');"><p>"Do we still mount watches?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4738" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们还有没有派人骑马巡逻? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4739');"><p>"We do, but..."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4739" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“有的，可是——” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4740');"><p>"This man wears a hunting horn." Mormont pointed at Othor. "Must I suppose that he died without sounding it? Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4740" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“这家伙身上带着猎号，”莫尔蒙指着奥瑟说，“莫非你要我相信他临死前连一声都没吹?还是你的游骑兵不只眼睛瞎了，连耳朵也聋啦? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4741');"><p>Ser Jaremy bristled, his face taut with anger. "No horn was blown, my lord, or my rangers would have heard it. I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like?.?.?.?and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before, by your own command."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4741" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>杰瑞米爵士气得毛发竖立，满脸怒容。“大人，没有人吹号角，否则我的游骑兵一定会听见。如今人手不够，根本无法照我的意图仔细巡逻……更何况自从班扬失踪，我们已经缩短了巡逻范围，比以前更靠近长城——这可是大人您亲自下的令。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4742');"><p>The Old Bear grunted. "Yes. Well. Be that as it may." He made an impatient gesture. "Tell me how they died."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4742" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>熊老咕哝道：“唉，也是。那就算了罢。”他不耐烦地挥挥手。“跟我说说他们是怎么死的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4743');"><p>Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers, Ser Jaremy grasped his head by the scalp. The hair came out between his fingers, brittle as straw. The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand. A great gash in the side of the corpse’s neck opened like a mouth, crusted with dried blood. Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck. "This was done with an axe."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4743" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>杰瑞米爵士在杰佛•佛花身旁蹲下，揪着头皮抓起头颅。发束从他指间落下，松脆有如稻草。骑士骂了一声，伸手把脸部翻过。尸体另一侧的脖颈部位有道深深的伤口，好似一张大嘴，其中积满了干涸的血块。头脖之间仅余几条肌腱相连。“他是给斧头砍死的。”．
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4744');"><p>"Aye," muttered Dywen, the old forester. "Belike the axe that Othor carried, m’lord."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4744" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“没错，”老林务官戴文喃喃道，“大人，俺说就是奥瑟平日惯用的那把斧头。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4745');"><p>Jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly, but he pressed his lips together and made himself look at the second body. Othor had been a big ugly man, and he made a big ugly corpse. No axe was in evidence. Jon remembered Othor; he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out. His singing days were done. His flesh was blanched white as milk, everywhere but his hands. His hands were black like Jafer’s. Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash, breast and groin and throat. Yet his eyes were still open. They stared up at the sky, blue as sapphires.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4745" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩只觉早餐在胃里翻涌，但他强自抿紧嘴唇，逼自己朝第二具尸体望去。奥瑟生前是个高大丑陋的人，死后尸体也是又大又丑。但四下却没有斧头的踪影。琼恩还记得奥瑟；他就是那个出发前高唱低俗小调的家伙。看来他唱歌的日子是完了。他的双手和杰佛一样完全漆黑。伤口如疹子般覆盖全身，从下体到胸部再到咽喉无一幸免，上面装饰着一朵朵干裂的的血花。他的眼睛依旧睁开，蓝宝石般的珠子直瞪天空。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4746');"><p>Ser Jaremy stood. "The wildlings have axes too."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4746" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>杰瑞米爵士站起身。“野人也是有斧头的。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4747');"><p>Mormont rounded on him. "So you believe this is Mance Rayder’s work? This close to the Wall?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4747" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙语带挑衅地对他说：“那依你之见，这是曼斯•雷德干的好事?在离长城这么近的地方? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4748');"><p>"Who else, my lord?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4748" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，不然还有谁呢? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4749');"><p>Jon could have told him. He knew, they all knew, yet no man of them would say the words. The Others are only a story, a tale to make children shiver. If they ever lived at all, they are gone eight thousand years. Even the thought made him feel foolish; he was a man grown now, a black brother of the Night’s Watch, not the boy who’d once sat at Old Nan’s feet with Bran and Robb and Arya.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4749" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>答案连琼恩都说得出。不仅他知道，大家都很清楚，但没有人愿意说出口。异鬼只是故事，用来吓小孩的传说。就算他们真的存在，也是八千年前的事。光是产生这个念头都教他觉得愚蠢：他是个成年人，是守夜人的黑衣弟兄，已非当年与布兰、罗柏和艾莉亚一同坐在老奶妈脚边的小男孩啦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4750');"><p>Yet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort. "If Ben Stark had come under wildling attack a half day’s ride from Castle Black, he would have returned for more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4750" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>但莫尔蒙司令哼了一声：“假如班•史塔克在距离黑城堡只有半天骑程的地方遭到野人攻击，他定会回来增调人马，追那些杀人犯到七层地狱，把他们的首级带来给我。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4751');"><p>"Unless he was slain as well," Ser Jaremy insisted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4751" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“除非连他自己也遇害。”杰瑞米爵士坚持。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4752');"><p>The words hurt, even now. It had been so long, it seemed folly to cling to the hope that Ben Stark was still alive, but Jon Snow was nothing if not stubborn.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4752" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>即使到现在，听到这些话依然令人心痛。过了这么久，期望班•史塔克还活着无异自欺欺人，但琼恩•雪诺别的没有，就是固执。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4753');"><p>"It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us, my lord," Ser Jaremy went on. "The forest is vast. The wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere. I’d wager these two were the last survivors of his party, on their way back to us?.?.?.?but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall. The corpses are still fresh, these men cannot have been dead more than a day?.?.?.?."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4753" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“大人，班扬离开我们已快半年，”杰瑞米爵士续道，“森林广阔，随处可能遭野人偷袭。我敢打赌，这两个是他队伍最后的聿存者，本准备回来找我们……只可惜在抵达长城之前被敌人追上。你瞧，这些尸体还很新鲜，死亡时间不会超过一天……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4754');"><p>"No," Samwell Tarly squeaked.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4754" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不对。”山姆威尔•塔利尖声说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4755');"><p>Jon was startled. Sam’s nervous, high-pitched voice was the last he would have expected to hear. The fat boy was frightened of the officers, and Ser Jaremy was not known for his patience.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4755" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩吓了一跳，他说什么也没料到会听见山姆紧张而高亢的话音。胖男孩向来很怕官员，而杰瑞米爵士又素以坏脾气出名。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4756');"><p>"I did not ask for your views, boy," Rykker said coldly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4756" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>小子，我可没问你意见。”莱克冷冷地说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4757');"><p>"Let him speak, ser," Jon blurted.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4757" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“让他说吧，爵士先生。”琼恩冲口而出。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4758');"><p>Mormont’s eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again. "If the lad has something to say, I’ll hear him out. Come closer, boy. We can’t see you behind those horses."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4758" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>莫尔蒙的视线从山姆飘向琼恩，然后又转向山姆：“如果那孩子有话要说，就让他说吧。小子，靠过来，躲在马后面我们可瞧不见你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4759');"><p>Sam edged past Jon and the garrons, sweating profusely. "My lord, it?.?.?.?it can’t be a day or?.?.?.?look?.?.?.?the blood?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4759" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆挤过琼恩和马匹，汗如雨下。“大人，不……不可能只有一天……请看……那个血……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4760');"><p>"Yes?" Mormont growled impatiently. "Blood, what of it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4760" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“嗯?”莫尔蒙不耐烦地皱眉，“血怎么样? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4761');"><p>"He soils his smallclothes at the sight of it," Chett shouted out, and the rangers laughed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4761" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他一见血就尿裤子啦。”齐特高喊，游骑兵们哄堂大笑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4762');"><p>Sam mopped at the sweat on his brow. "You?.?.?.?you can see where Ghost?.?.?.?Jon’s direwolf?.?.?.?you can see where he tore off that man’s hand, and yet?.?.?.?the stump hasn’t bled, look?.?.?.?" He waved a hand. "My father?.?.?.?L-lord Randyll, he, he made me watch him dress animals sometimes, when?.?.?.?after?.?.?.?" Sam shook his head from side to side, his chins quivering. Now that he had looked at the bodies, he could not seem to look away. "A fresh kill?.?.?.?the blood would still flow, my lords. Later?.?.?.?later it would be clotted, like a?.?.?.?a jelly, thick and?.?.?.?and?.?.?.?" He looked as though he was going to be sick. "This man?.?.?.?look at the wrist, it’s all?.?.?.?crusty?.?.?.?dry?.?.?.?like ?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4762" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>山姆抹抹额上的汗珠。“您……您看白灵……琼恩的冰原狼……您看它咬断手的地方，可是……断肢没有流血，您看……”他挥挥手。“家父……蓝一蓝道伯爵，他，他有时候会逼我看他处理猎物……在……之后……”山姆摇头晃脑，下巴动个不休。这会儿他真看了，视线反而离不开尸体。“刚死的猎物……大人，血还会流动。之后……之后才会凝结成块，像是……像是肉冻，浓稠的肉冻，而且……而且……”他似乎要吐了。“这个人……请看，他的手腕很……很脆……又干又脆……像是……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4763');"><p>Jon saw at once what Sam meant. He could see the torn veins in the dead man’s wrist, iron worms in the pale flesh. His blood was a black dust. Yet Jaremy Rykker was unconvinced. "If they’d been dead much longer than a day, they’d be ripe by now, boy. They don’t even smell."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4763" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>琼恩立刻明白了山姆的意思。他可以看见死人腕部断裂的血管，活像惨白肌肉里的铁蠕虫，血也冻成黑粉末。但杰瑞米•莱克不以为然。“如果他们真死了一天以上，现在早就臭得要命。可他们一点味道也没有。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4764');"><p>Dywen, the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could smell snow coming on, sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff. "Well, they’re no pansy flowers, but?.?.?.?m’lord has the truth of it. There’s no corpse stink."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4764" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>饱经风霜的老林务官戴文最爱夸耀自己嗅觉灵敏，常说连降雪都能闻出来。这会儿他悄悄走到尸体旁边，嗅了一下。“嗯，是不怎么好闻，不过……大人说得没错，的确没有尸臭。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4765');"><p>"They?.?.?.?they aren’t rotting." Sam pointed, his fat finger shaking only a little. "Look, there’s?.?.?.?there’s no maggots or?.?.?.?or?.?.?.?worms or anything?.?.?.?they’ve been lying here in the woods, but they?.?.?.?they haven’t been chewed or eaten by animals?.?.?.?only Ghost?.?.?.?otherwise they’re?.?.?.?they’re?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4765" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们……他们也没有腐烂，”山姆指给大家看，胖手指颤抖不休。“请看，他们身上没有……没有生蛆，也……也……没有其他的虫子……他们在森林里躺了这么久，却……却没有被动物撕咬或吃掉……若不是白灵……他们……”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4766');"><p>"Untouched," Jon said softly. "And Ghost is different. The dogs and the horses won’t go near them."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4766" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可说毫发无伤。”琼恩轻声道，“而且白灵和其他动物不一样。狗儿和马都不愿靠近他们的尸体。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4767');"><p>The rangers exchanged glances; they could see it was true, every man of them. Mormont frowned, glancing from the corpses to the dogs. "Chett, bring the hounds closer."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4767" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>游骑兵们彼此交换眼神，每个人都知道此话不假。莫尔蒙皱起眉头，将视线从尸体移到狗群。“齐特，把猎狗带过来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4768');"><p>Chett tried, cursing, yanking on the leashes, giving one animal a lick of his boot. Most of the dogs just whimpered and planted their feet. He tried dragging one. The bitch resisted, growling and squirming as if to escape her collar. Finally she lunged at him. Chett dropped the leash and stumbled backward. The dog leapt over him and bounded off into the trees.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4768" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>齐特连忙照办，一边咒骂，一边拉扯狗链，还伸腿踢了狗一脚。但猎狗们多半呜咽着，打定主意不肯挪动。他试着强拉一只母狗，结果它拼命顽抗，又吼又扭，企图挣脱项圈，最后竟朝他扑去。齐特丢下绳子踉跄后退，狗跳过他跑进森林去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4769');"><p>"This?.?.?.?this is all wrong," Sam Tarly said earnestly.

The Wall was weeping copiously, had been weeping for days, and sometimes Jon even imagined it was shrinking.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4780');"><p>Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees. Without the direwolf, Jon felt almost naked. He found himself glancing at every shadow with unease. Unbidden, he thought back on the tales that Old Nan used to tell them, when he was a boy at Winterfell. He could almost hear her voice again, and the click-click-click of her needles. In that darkness, the Others came riding, she used to say, dropping her voice lower and lower. Cold and dead they were, and they hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every living creature with hot blood in its veins. Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men all fell before them, as they moved south on pale dead horses, leading hosts of the slain. They fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children?.?.?.?

That might mean Lord Eddard would return to Winterfell, and his sisters as well. He might even be allowed to visit them, with Lord Mormont’s permission. It would be good to see Arya’s grin again and to talk with his father. I will ask him about my mother, he resolved. I am a man now, it is past time he told me. Even if she was a whore, I don’t care, I want to know.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4797" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“他们情同手足。”琼恩暗忖乔佛里是否会继续让父亲担任御前首相一职。他觉得不大可能。也就是说，艾德公爵即将返回临冬城，还有他的两个妹妹。假如他能得到莫尔蒙大人的允许，说不定还可以去探望他们。能再见到艾莉亚机灵的笑容，并和父亲谈谈，一定会是件很棒的事。到时候我定要问他母亲的事，他下定决心，如今我已长大成人，说什么他都该告诉我了。即便她是个妓女我也不在乎，我一定要知道。
