</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4634');"><p>They came for Sansa on the third day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4634" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>事发后第三天，他们才带珊莎去见王后。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4635');"><p>She chose a simple dress of dark grey wool, plainly cut but richly embroidered around the collar and sleeves. Her fingers felt thick and clumsy as she struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of servants. Jeyne Poole had been confined with her, but Jeyne was useless. Her face was puffy from all her crying, and she could not seem to stop sobbing about her father.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4635" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她选了一条式样简单的深灰色羊毛裙，剪裁虽然朴素，袖口和领子却绣得精细。没有仆人帮忙，她只得自己系上银色衣带，顿时觉得手指笨拙而不灵活。珍妮•普尔虽和她软禁在一起，却一点忙也帮不上。她哭肿了脸，一直为了她父亲哭哭啼啼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4636');"><p>"I’m certain your father is well," Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right. "I’ll ask the queen to let you see him." She thought that kindness might lift Jeyne’s spirits, but the other girl just looked at her with red, swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder. She was such a child.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4636" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我相信你父亲一定没事，”总算扣好衣服后，珊莎告诉她，“我会请王后让你见见他。”她本以为如此好心的提议定可提起珍妮的精神，想不到她却用红肿的眼睛怔怔地看她，然后哭得更厉害。真是个长不大的小孩。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4637');"><p>Sansa had wept too, the first day. Even within the stout walls of Maegor’s Holdfast, with her door closed and barred, it was hard not to be terrified when the killing began. She had grown up to the sound of steel in the yard, and scarcely a day of her life had passed without hearing the clash of sword on sword, yet somehow knowing that the fighting was real made all the difference in the world. She heard it as she had never heard it before, and there were other sounds as well, grunts of pain, angry curses, shouts for help, and the moans of wounded and dying men. In the songs, the knights never screamed nor begged for mercy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4637" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>事发当天，珊莎也哭过。纵然有梅葛楼重重厚墙所保护，且房门紧闭放下门闩，但屠杀开始时却依旧骇人。她从小听着广场上的金铁交击声长大，几乎天天都会见识刀剑，可一旦知道外面是来真的，一切又都不一样了。它们变得那么陌生，闻所未闻的声音不断传来：吃痛闷哼声、愤怒咒骂声、呼喊求救声，以及负伤垂死之人的呻吟。歌谣里的骑士从来不会惨叫，从来不会跪地求饶。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4638');"><p>So she wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening, calling for her father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince. If the men guarding her heard her pleas, they gave no answer. The only time the door opened was late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside, bruised and shaking. "They’re killing everyone," the steward’s daughter had shrieked at her. She went on and on. The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer, she said. There were bodies on the stair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were slick with blood. Sansa dried her own tears as she struggled to comfort her friend. They went to sleep in the same bed, cradled in each other’s arms like sisters.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4638" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>所以她哭了，隔着门请求他们告诉她到底发生了什么。她呼唤父亲，呼唤茉丹修女，呼唤国王，呼唤她的白马王子。可惜就算门外守卫听见了她的哀求，他们也没有回应。他们只在当天深夜打开门，把浑身淤伤、颤抖不已的珍妮•普尔推进来。“他们把所有人都杀光了。”管家的女儿朝她尖叫。说猎狗拿着战锤破门进入她的房间，首相塔的螺旋梯上全是死尸，染血的阶梯滑溜溜的。珊莎擦干眼泪，努力安慰自己的朋友。她们睡在同一张床上，相互搂抱，宛如姐妹。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4639');"><p>The second day was even worse. The room where Sansa had been confined was at the top of the highest tower of Maegor’s Holdfast. From its window, she could see that the heavy iron portcullis in the gatehouse was down, and the drawbridge drawn up over the deep dry moat that separated the keep-within-a-keep from the larger castle that surrounded it. Lannister guardsmen prowled the walls with spears and crossbows to hand. The fighting was over, and the silence of the grave had settled over the Red Keep. The only sounds were Jeyne Poole’s endless whimpers and sobs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4639" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>第二天情况更糟。珊莎被监禁的房间位于梅葛楼最高塔的顶层。从窗户望去可以看到城门楼的铁闸已经放下，干涸护城河上的吊桥升起，切断了这座城中城与城堡其余部分的联系。兰尼斯特卫兵手执长枪和十字弓逡巡于城墙之上。打斗已经结束，宛如墓地般的死寂笼罩了红堡，只剩下珍妮•普>尔无尽的抽噎啜泣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4640');"><p>They were fed, hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break their fast, roast chicken and greens at midday, and a late supper of beef and barley stew, but the servants who brought the meals would not answer Sansa’s questions. That evening, some women brought her clothes from the Tower of the Hand, and some of Jeyne’s things as well, but they seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne, and when she tried to talk to them, they fled from her as if she had the grey plague. The guards outside the door still refused to let them leave the room.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4640" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她们没被饿着——早餐是硬乳酪，刚出炉的面包和牛奶，中午是烤鸡和青蔬，晚餐则是牛肉大麦浓汤——但送饭的人拒绝回答珊莎的问题。当天傍晚，有几位妇人从首相塔带了些她和珍妮的衣物过来，可她们惊慌失措的程度与珍妮不相上下，她刚要开口问话，她们便仿如见了灰疫病般避之唯恐不及。门外的守卫也依旧不让她们离开房间。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4641');"><p>"Please, I need to speak to the queen again," Sansa told them, as she told everyone she saw that day. "She’ll want to talk to me, I know she will. Tell her I want to see her, please. If not the queen, then Prince Joffrey, if you’d be so kind. We’re to marry when we’re older."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4641" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“求求你，我要跟王后谈谈，”她对他们说，那天她对每个人都这样说。“她想见我的，我知道。请你们转告她我要见她。如果见不到王后，麻烦你们去找乔佛里王子。我和他长大以后要结婚的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4642');"><p>At sunset on the second day, a great bell began to ring. Its voice was deep and sonorous, and the long slow clanging filled Sansa with a sense of dread. The ringing went on and on, and after a while they heard other bells answering from the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s Hill. The sound rumbled across the city like thunder, warning of the storm to come.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4642" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>震耳欲聋的钟声于那天日落时分响起。钟声沉厚而洪亮，缓慢悠长的余音却教珊莎感到莫名的恐惧。钟声响而未绝，一会儿之后她们听见维桑尼亚丘陵上贝勒大圣堂里的钟也跟着回应。声音宛如阵雷，轰隆响彻全城，预示着即将来临的狂风暴雨。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4643');"><p>"What is it?" Jeyne asked, covering her ears. "Why are they ringing the bells?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4643" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“发生了什么事? ”珍妮捂着耳朵问，“他们为什么敲钟? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4644');"><p>"The king is dead." Sansa could not say how she knew it, yet she did. The slow, endless clanging filled their room, as mournful as a dirge. Had some enemy stormed the castle and murdered King Robert? Was that the meaning of the fighting they had heard?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4644" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“国王驾崩了。”珊莎说不上自己如何知道，但她就是知道。缓慢而无止尽的钟声充斥房间，哀伤有如挽歌。难道有敌人攻进城里，杀害了劳勃国王?难道这就是她们所听见的打斗?
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4645');"><p>She went to sleep wondering, restless, and fearful. Was her beautiful Joffrey the king now? Or had they killed him too? She was afraid for him, and for her father. If only they would tell her what was happening?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4645" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她满脑疑惑地睡去，睡得很不安稳，捉心吊胆。她英俊的乔佛里如今是国王了吗?还是他们连他也一起杀了?她为他担心，也为父亲害怕。如果他们告诉她外面究竟怎么回事就好了……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4646');"><p>That night Sansa dreamt of Joffrey on the throne, with herself seated beside him in a gown of woven gold. She had a crown on her head, and everyone she had ever known came before her, to bend the knee and say their courtesies.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4646" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>那天晚上，珊莎梦见乔佛里坐在王位上，她自己则穿着一袭金衣靠在他身旁，头顶冠冕，她所认识的每个人都来到她面前屈膝致意。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4647');"><p>The next morning, the morning of the third day, Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard came to escort her to the queen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4647" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>翌日清晨，亦即第三天早上，御林铁卫的柏洛斯•布劳恩爵士前来护送她去觐见王后。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4648');"><p>Ser Boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. His nose was flat, his cheeks baggy with jowls, his hair grey and brittle. Today he wore white velvet, and his snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch. The beast had the soft sheen of gold, and his eyes were tiny rubies. "You look very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser Boros," Sansa told him. A lady remembered her courtesies, and she was resolved to be a lady no matter what.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4648" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>柏洛斯爵士是个胸膛宽厚，有一双向外弯曲的短腿的丑陋男子。他生了个扁鼻，两颊松弛，一头发臼糟糕的灰发。这天他穿了白天鹅绒外衣，雪白披风用一个狮子别针系着。狮子镀上一层软金箔，有小小的红宝石镶成的眼睛。“ 柏洛斯爵士，您今早真是容光焕发，格外迷人哪。”珊莎告诉他。官家小姐无时无刻不能忘记礼貌，而且她下定决心无论如何都要有个官家小姐的样子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4649');"><p>"And you, my lady," Ser Boros said in a flat voice. "Her Grace awaits. Come with me."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4649" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“小姐，您也是哪。”柏洛斯爵士语气平板地说，“王后陛下正在等你。请随我来。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4650');"><p>There were guards outside her door, Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms. Sansa made herself smile at them pleasantly and bid them a good morning as she passed. It was the first time she had been allowed outside the chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings past. "To keep you safe, my sweet one," Queen Cersei had told her. "Joffrey would never forgive me if anything happened to his precious."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4650" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>门外有红袍狮盔的兰尼斯特卫兵站岗，珊莎经过时，还特别友好地朝他们微笑早安。这是她自两天前被亚历斯•奥克赫特爵士带来这里后首次踏出房门。“好孩子，这是为你的安全着想，”瑟曦王后告诉她，“如果乔佛里亲爱的女孩出了意外，他一定不会原谅我的。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4651');"><p>Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments, but instead he led her out of Maegor’s Holdfast. The bridge was down again. Some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat. When Sansa peered down, she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below. She averted her eyes quickly, afraid to ask, afraid to look too long, afraid he might be someone she knew.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4651" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎本以为柏洛斯爵士会护送她到王家居室，没想到他却领她走出了梅葛楼。吊桥已再度放下。几名工人正把同伴用绳子垂到干涸的护城河床。珊莎探头一看，只见下方巨大的尖刺上钉了一具尸首。她连忙移开视线，不敢发问，不敢再看，不敢想象那是某位她所认识的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4652');"><p>They found Queen Cersei in the council chambers, seated at the head of a long table littered with papers, candles, and blocks of sealing wax. The room was as splendid as any that Sansa had ever seen. She stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin sphinxes that sat beside the door.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4652" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>他们在议事厅里找到瑟曦王后，她正坐在长桌的首位，桌上堆满纸张、蜡烛和一叠叠的蜡泥。珊莎不曾见过陈舔如此华丽的房间，不由得睁大眼睛看着雕花木屏风，以及蹲坐大门两侧的人面狮身兽雕像。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4653');"><p>"Your Grace," Ser Boros said when they were ushered inside by another of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face, "I’ve brought the girl."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4653" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“王后陛下，”当另一名御林铁卫，生了张死人脸的曼登爵士领他们走进去时，柏洛斯爵士开口说，“我把这女孩带来了。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4654');"><p>Sansa had hoped Joffrey might be with her. Her prince was not there, but three of the king’s councillors were. Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen’s left hand, Grand Maester Pycelle at the end of the table, while Lord Varys hovered over them, smelling flowery. All of them were clad in black, she realized with a feeling of dread. Mourning clothes?.?.?.?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4654" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎原本期盼乔佛里会和王后在一起，可惜她的白马王子没来，反倒是三位重臣在场。派提尔•贝里席伯爵坐在王后左手，派席尔国师在桌子另一边，浑身花香的瓦里斯伯爵则在他们周围晃来晃去。她突然恐惧地发现他们都身着黑衣，那是丧服的颜色啊……
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4655');"><p>The queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice, covering her from neck to bosom. They were cut in the shape of teardrops, as if the queen were weeping blood. Cersei smiled to see her, and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen. "Sansa, my sweet child," she said, "I know you’ve been asking for me. I’m sorry that I could not send for you sooner. Matters have been very unsettled, and I have not had a moment. I trust my people have been taking good care of you?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4655" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王后穿了一件高领的黑丝礼服，上身缝缀了上百颗暗红宝石，从脖颈直覆到胸部。宝石被琢磨成泪滴的形状，一眼望去，王后仿佛正在泣血。瑟曦见到她，脸上露出珊莎所见过最甜美、却也最哀伤的微笑。“珊莎，我的好孩子。”她说，“我知道你一直想见我，很抱歉我到现在才找你来。只怪最近诸事纷乱，我实在抽不出时间。我想我的手下没让你受委屈罢?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4656');"><p>"Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant, Your Grace, thank you ever so much for asking," Sansa said politely. "Only, well, no one will talk to us or tell us what’s happened?.?.?.?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4656" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“陛下，每个人都对我们既照顾又友好，非常感谢您的关心，”珊莎彬彬有礼地说，“只不过，嗯，没有人愿意跟我们说话，或者告诉我们到底发生了什么……” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4657');"><p>"Us?" Cersei seemed puzzled.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4657" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们?”瑟曦似乎颇感困惑。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4658');"><p>"We put the steward’s girl in with her," Ser Boros said. "We did not know what else to do with her."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4658" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“我们把那个管家的女儿送去跟她一起住，”柏洛斯爵士道，“我们实在不知该拿她怎么办。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4659');"><p>The queen frowned. "Next time, you will ask," she said, her voice sharp. "The gods only know what sort of tales she’s been filling Sansa’s head with."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4659" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王后皱起眉头。“下回记得先问，”她口气锐利地说，“天知道她朝珊莎脑子里鬼扯些什么。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4660');"><p>"Jeyne’s scared," Sansa said. "She won’t stop crying. I promised her I’d ask if she could see her father."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4660" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“珍妮她吓坏了，”珊莎说，“整天哭个不停。我答应帮她问可不可以让她见见她父亲。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4661');"><p>Old Grand Maester Pycelle lowered his eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4661" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔老国师垂下眼睛。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4662');"><p>"Her father is well, isn’t he?" Sansa said anxiously. She knew there had been fighting, but surely no one would harm a steward. Vayon Poole did not even wear a sword.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4662" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她父亲没事吧?”珊莎焦急地说。她知道外面发生过打斗，但总不会有人伤害一个做管家的人吧?维扬•普尔平日可是连剑都不配的。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4663');"><p>Queen Cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn. "I won’t have Sansa fretting needlessly. What shall we do with this little friend of hers, my lords?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4663" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>瑟曦王后依次扫视每位重臣。“我可不希望珊莎受到无谓的惊吓。诸位大人，我们该如何来安顿她这位小朋友呢?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4664');"><p>Lord Petyr leaned forward. "I’ll find a place for her."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4664" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>培提尔伯爵往前靠。“我来给她找个地方吧。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4665');"><p>"Not in the city," said the queen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4665" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“不要留在城里。”王后说。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4666');"><p>"Do you take me for a fool?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4666" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你当我是笨蛋不成?” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4667');"><p>The queen ignored that. "Ser Boros, escort this girl to Lord Petyr’s apartments and instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her. Tell her that Littlefinger will be taking her to see her father, that ought to calm her down. I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4667" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王后没理他。“柏洛斯爵士，劳驾您护送这位小妹妹前往培捉尔大人住处，并吩咐他的手下妥善照顾，直到他回去为止。就跟她说小指头会带她去见她父亲，这样该能安抚她的情绪。我希望你在珊莎回去之前将此事办妥。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4668');"><p>"As you command, Your Grace," Ser Boros said. He bowed deeply, spun on his heel, and took his leave, his long white cloak stirring the air behind him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4668" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“遵命，陛下。”柏洛斯爵士道。他深深一鞠躬，笔直地跃起身，抖着身后的白披风离开。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4669');"><p>Sansa was confused. "I don’t understand," she said. "Where is Jeyne’s father? Why can’t Ser Boros take her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it?" She had promised herself she would be a lady, gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother, the Lady Catelyn, but all of a sudden she was scared again. For a second she thought she might cry. "Where are you sending her? She hasn’t done anything wrong, she’s a good girl."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4669" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎被搞糊涂了。“我不懂，”她说，“珍妮的父亲他人在哪里呢?柏洛斯爵士为何不直接带她去见他，反而要培提尔大人带她去呀? ”她本已立志要有淑女风范，要像王后那般温柔，像母亲凯特琳夫人那般坚毅，但这会儿她突然又害怕起来，甚至担心自己会掉下眼泪。“您要把她送到哪儿?她是个好女孩，什么也没做错啊。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4670');"><p>"She’s upset you," the queen said gently. "We can’t be having that. Not another word, now. Lord Baelish will see that Jeyne’s well taken care of, I promise you." She patted the chair beside her. "Sit down, Sansa. I want to talk to you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4670" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“她害你担惊受怕了，”王后温柔地说，“我们可不能让这种事再度发生。别提她了，嗯?我向你保证，贝里席大人会好好照顾珍妮的。”她拍拍旁边的椅子。“坐下吧，珊莎，我有话跟你说。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4671');"><p>Sansa seated herself beside the queen. Cersei smiled again, but that did not make her feel any less anxious. Varys was wringing his soft hands together, Grand Maester Pycelle kept his sleepy eyes on the papers in front of him, but she could feel Littlefinger staring. Something about the way the small man looked at her made Sansa feel as though she had no clothes on. Goose bumps pimpled her skin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4671" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>珊莎在王后身旁坐下。瑟曦再度露出微笑，然而这次却没能纾解她的不安。瓦里斯绞着他柔软的双手，派席尔国师撑着充满睡意的眼睛，看着眼前的纸张，但她能感觉小指头盯着自己的视线。矮个子看她的眼神，总让珊莎觉得自己仿佛没穿衣服，不禁浑身起了鸡皮疙瘩。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4672');"><p>"Sweet Sansa," Queen Cersei said, laying a soft hand on her wrist. "Such a beautiful child. I do hope you know how much Joffrey and I love you."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4672" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“亲爱的珊莎，”瑟曦王后边说边伸出一只柔软的手，放在她手腕上。“你真是个漂亮的好孩子。我真希望你知道乔佛里和我有多么爱你。” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4673');"><p>"You do?" Sansa said, breathless. Littlefinger was forgotten. Her prince loved her. Nothing else mattered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4673" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“真的吗? ”珊莎简直喘不过气来。小指头顿时被抛到脑后。她的白马王子爱她。其他一切都不重要了。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4674');"><p>The queen smiled. "I think of you almost as my own daughter. And I know the love you bear for Joffrey." She gave a weary shake of her head. "I am afraid we have some grave news about your lord father. You must be brave, child."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4674" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>王后微笑道：“我几乎把你当成自己的女儿，我也知道你是真心真意地爱着乔佛里。”她微微摇头。“但关于你父亲大人，恐怕我有些沉重的消息要对你说。孩子，你千万要鼓起勇气。”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4675');"><p>Her quiet words gave Sansa a chill. "What is it?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4675" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>她从容的话语却教珊莎打了个冷颤。“什么消息? ” 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4676');"><p>"Your father is a traitor, dear," Lord Varys said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4676" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“你父亲叛国，亲爱的。”瓦里斯伯爵道。 
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4677');"><p>Grand Maester Pycelle lifted his ancient head. "With my own ears, I heard Lord Eddard swear to our beloved King Robert that he would protect the young princes as if they were his own sons. And yet the moment the king was dead, he called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey’s rightful throne."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4677" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>派席尔国师抬起苍老的头颅。“我亲耳听见艾德大人向劳勃国王发誓会保护小王子，把他当成自己儿子看待。想不到等国王一死，他就立刻召集重臣，妄图窃取本应属于乔佛里的王位。”

The paper was torn and stiff with dried blood, but the broken seal was her father’s, the direwolf stamped in pale wax. "We found this on the captain of your household guard, Sansa.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4680');"><p>"Please, Your Grace, there’s been a mistake." Sudden panic made her dizzy and faint. "Please, send for my father, he’ll tell you, he would never write such a letter, the king was his friend."

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4681');"><p>"Robert thought so," said the queen. "This betrayal would have broken his heart. The gods are kind, that he did not live to see it." She sighed. "Sansa, sweetling, you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in. You are innocent of any wrong, we all know that, and yet you are the daughter of a traitor. How can I allow you to marry my son?"
</p></origin><translate id="div_4681" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“劳勃当初也是这么想，”王后道，“他若是地下有知，这件事准会伤透他的心。聿好诸神慈悲，没让他生前见到。”她叹口气。“珊莎，我亲爱的好孩子，你一定也知道这件事让我们有多为难。此事与你无关，这我们都明白，但你毕竟是个叛国者的女儿，你说我怎么敢让你嫁给我儿子呢?”
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4682');"><p>"But I love him," Sansa wailed, confused and frightened. What did they mean to do to her? What had they done to her father? It was not supposed to happen this way. She had to wed Joffrey, they were betrothed, he was promised to her, she had even dreamed about it. It wasn’t fair to take him away from her on account of whatever her father might have done.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4682" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“可是我爱他啊。”珊莎既困惑又害怕地啜泣道。他们打算如何处置她?他们又对父亲做了些什么?事情不应该变成这样子的。她一定要嫁给乔佛里，他们不是已经订婚了吗?他不是已经许给她了吗?她还梦见过两人成亲的景象呢。因为父亲的所作所为，便要硬生生将他夺走，实在太不公平了。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4684');"><p>"It was for love," Sansa said in a rush. "Father wouldn’t even give me leave to say farewell." She was the good girl, the obedient girl, but she had felt as wicked as Arya that morning, sneaking away from Septa Mordane, defying her lord father. She had never done anything so willful before, and she would never have done it then if she hadn’t loved Joffrey as much as she did. "He was going to take me back to Winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight, even though it was Joff I wanted. I told him, but he wouldn’t listen." The king had been her last hope. The king could command Father to let her stay in King’s Landing and marry Prince Joffrey, Sansa knew he could, but the king had always frightened her. He was loud and rough-voiced and drunk as often as not, and he would probably have just sent her back to Lord Eddard, if they even let her see him. So she went to the queen instead, and poured out her heart, and Cersei had listened and thanked her sweetly?.?.?.?only then Ser Arys had escorted her to the high room in Maegor’s Holdfast and posted guards, and a few hours later, the fighting had begun outside. "Please," she finished, "you have to let me marry Joffrey, I’ll be ever so good a wife to him, you’ll see. I’ll be a queen just like you, I promise."
</p></origin><translate id="div_4684" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>“是啊，我好爱他，”珊莎急促地说，“可父亲连让我说声再见都不准。”她向来是听话乖巧的好女儿，但那天早上她偷偷从茉丹修女身边溜开，违背父亲意愿的时候，却觉得自己跟艾莉亚一样坏。她以前从未如此任性而为，若非她深爱着乔佛里，也不会这么做。“他打算送我回临冬城，把我嫁给默默无闻的雇佣骑士，也不管我只想要。我跟他说了，可他就是听不进去。”她的希望只剩下国王，只有国王才能命令父亲让她留在君临和乔佛里成亲。话虽如此，她却一直很怕这个讲话粗声粗气，成天喝得酩酊大醉的国王，更何况就算当真见到他，他很可能只会派人把她送回父亲身边。所以她去找王后，将心事和盘吐露，瑟曦听完之后沉重地向她道谢……接着却派亚历斯爵士护送她到梅葛楼的高塔房间，并在门外安排守卫，没过多久，外面便传来打斗声。“求求您，”她把话说完，“您一定要让我嫁给乔佛里，我会当个好妻子的，真的，我保证会当个像您一样的王后。”

He had to listen, he loved her, even the queen said so. Joff would need to punish Father, the lords would expect it, but perhaps he could send him back to Winterfell, or exile him to one of the Free Cities across the narrow sea. It would only have to be for a few years. By then she and Joffrey would be married. Once she was queen, she could persuade Joff to bring Father back and grant him a pardon.
