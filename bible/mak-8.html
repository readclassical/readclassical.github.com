</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"><p>16:3 And they were saying among themselves, Who will get the stone rolled away from the door for us?
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:3 彼此说，谁给我们把石头从墓门滚开呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"><p>16:4 And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back; and it was of great size.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:4 那石头原来很大，她们抬头一看，却见石头已经滚开了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"><p>16:5 And when they went in, they saw a young man seated on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were full of wonder.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:5 她们进了坟墓，看见一个少年人坐在右边，穿着白袍。就甚惊恐。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"><p>16:6 And he said to them, Do not be troubled: you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been put to death on the cross; he has come back from the dead; he is not here: see, the place where they put him!
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:6 那少年人对她们说，不要惊恐。你们寻找那钉十字架的拿撒勒人耶稣。他已经复活了，不在这里。请看安放他的地方。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"><p>16:7 But go, say to his disciples and to Peter, He goes before you into Galilee: there you will see him, as he said to you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:7 你们可以去告诉他的门徒和彼得说，他在你们以先往加利利去。在那里你们要见他，正如他从前所告诉你们的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"><p>16:8 And they went out quickly from the place, because fear and great wonder had come on them: and they said nothing to anyone, because they were full of fear that ...
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:8 她们就出来，从坟墓那里逃跑。又发抖，又惊奇，什么也不告诉人。因为她们害怕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"><p>16:9 Now when he came back from the dead early on the first day of the week, he went first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had sent out seven evil spirits.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:9 在七日的第一日清早，耶稣复活了，就先向抹大拉的马利亚显现。耶稣从她身上曾赶出七个鬼。

</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:10 她去告诉那向来跟随耶稣的人。那时他们正哀恸哭泣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"><p>16:11 And they, when it came to their ears that he was living, and had been seen by her, had no belief in it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:11 他们听见耶稣活了，被马利亚看见，却是不信。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"><p>16:12 And after these things he was seen in another form by two of them, while they were walking on their way into the country.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"><p>16:13 And they went away and gave news of it to the rest; and they had no belief in what was said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:13 他们就去告诉其余的门徒。其余的门徒，也是不信。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"><p>16:14 And later he was seen by the eleven themselves while they were taking food; and he said sharp words to them because they had no faith and their hearts were hard, and because they had no belief in those who had seen him after he had come back from the dead.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:14 后来，十一个门徒坐席的时候，耶稣向他们显现，责备他们不信，心里刚硬。因为他们不信那些在他复活以后看见他的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"><p>16:15 And he said to them, Go into all the world, and give the good news to everyone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:15 他又对他们说，你们往普天下去，传福音给万民听。（万民原文作凡受造的）
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"><p>16:16 He who has faith and is given baptism will get salvation; but he who has not faith will be judged.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"><p>16:18 They will take up snakes, and if there is poison in their drink, it will do them no evil; they will put their hands on those who are ill, and they will get well.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:18 手能拿蛇。若喝了什么毒物，也必不受害。手按病人，病人就必好了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"><p>16:19 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had said these words to them, was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:19 主耶稣和他们说完了话，后来被接到天上，坐在神的右边。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"><p>16:20 And they went out, preaching everywhere, the Lord working with them, and giving witness to the word by the signs which came after. So be it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>16:20 门徒出去，到处宣传福音，主和他们同工，用神迹随着，证实所传的道。阿们。
