</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:1 此后，亚扪人的王拿辖死了，他儿子接续他作王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"><p>19:2 And David said, I will be a friend to Hanun, the son of Nahash, because his father was a friend to me. So David sent men to him, to give him words of comfort on account of his father. And the servants of David came to Hanun, to the land of the children of Ammon, offering him comfort.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:2 大卫说，我要照哈嫩的父亲拿辖厚待我的恩典厚待哈嫩。于是大卫差遣使者为他丧父安慰他。大卫的臣仆到了亚扪人的境内见哈嫩，要安慰他，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"><p>19:3 But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father, by sending comforters to you? is it not clear that these men have only come to go through the land and to make secret observation of it so that they may overcome it?
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:3 但亚扪人的首领对哈嫩说，大卫差人来安慰你，你想他是尊敬你父亲吗？他的臣仆来见你不是为详察窥探，倾覆这地吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"><p>19:4 So Hanun took David's servants, and cutting off their hair and the skirts of their robes up to the middle, sent them away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:4 哈嫩便将大卫臣仆的胡须剃去一半，又割断他们下半截的衣服，使他们露出下体，打发他们回去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"><p>19:5 Then certain men went and gave David word of what had been done to them. And he sent out with the purpose of meeting them; for the men were greatly shamed. And the king said, Keep where you are at Jericho till your hair is long again, and then come back.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:5 有人将臣仆所遇的事告诉大卫，他就差人去迎接他们，因为他们甚觉羞耻。告诉他们说，可以住在耶利哥，等到胡须长起再回来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"><p>19:6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver as payment for war-carriages and horsemen from Mesopotamia and Aram-maacah and Zobah.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:6 亚扪人知道大卫憎恶他们，哈嫩和亚扪人就打发人拿一千他连得银子，从米所波大米，亚兰，玛迦，琐巴雇战车和马兵，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"><p>19:7 So with this money they got thirty-two thousand war-carriages, and the help of the king of Maacah and his people, who came and took up their position in front of Medeba. And the children of Ammon came together from their towns for the fight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:7 于是雇了三万二千辆战车和玛迦王并他的军兵。他们来安营在米底巴前。亚扪人也从他们的城里出来，聚集交战。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"><p>19:8 And David, hearing of it, sent Joab with all the army of fighting-men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:8 大卫听见了，就差派约押统带勇猛的全军出去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"><p>19:9 So the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position on the way into the town; and the kings who had come were stationed by themselves in the field.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:9 亚扪人出来在城门前摆阵，所来的诸王另在郊野摆阵。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"><p>19:10 Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back, he took all the best men of Israel, and put them in line against the Aramaeans;
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:10 约押看见敌人在他前后摆阵，就从以色列军中挑选精兵，使他们对着亚兰人摆阵。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"><p>19:11 And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon with Abishai, his brother, at their head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:11 其余的兵交与他兄弟亚比筛，对着亚扪人摆阵。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"><p>19:12 And he said, If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me, then come to my help; and if the children of Ammon get the better of you, I will come to your help.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:12 约押对亚比筛说，亚兰人若强过我，你就来帮助我。亚扪人若强过你，我就去帮助你。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"><p>19:13 Take heart, and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God; and may the Lord do what seems good to him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:13 我们都当刚强，为本国的民和神的城邑作大丈夫，愿耶和华凭他的意旨而行。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"><p>19:14 So Joab and the people who were with him went forward into the fight against the Aramaeans, and they went in flight before him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:14 于是约押和跟随他的人前进攻打亚兰人。亚兰人在约押面前逃跑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"><p>19:15 And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans, they themselves went in flight from Abishai, his brother, and came into the town. Then Joab came back to Jerusalem.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:15 亚扪人见亚兰人逃跑，他们也在约押的兄弟亚比筛面前逃跑进城。约押就回耶路撒冷去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"><p>19:16 And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they sent men to get the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River, with Shophach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:16 亚兰人见自己被以色列人打败，就打发使者将大河那边的亚兰人调来，哈大利谢的将军朔法率领他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"><p>19:17 And word of this was given to David; and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam and put his forces in position against them. And when David's forces were in position against the Aramaeans, the fight was started.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:17 有人告诉大卫，他就聚集以色列众人过约旦河，来到亚兰人那里，迎着他们摆阵。大卫既摆阵攻击亚兰人，亚兰人就与他打仗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"><p>19:18 And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven thousand Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and put to death Shophach, the captain of the army.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:18 亚兰人在以色列人面前逃跑。大卫杀了亚兰七千辆战车的人，四万步兵，又杀了亚兰的将军朔法。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"><p>19:19 And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants: and the Aramaeans would give no more help to the children of Ammon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>19:19 属哈大利谢的诸王见自己被以色列人打败，就与大卫和好，归服他。于是亚兰人不敢再帮助亚扪人了。
