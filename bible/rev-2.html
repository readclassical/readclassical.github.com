</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"><p>10:4 And when the seven thunders had given out their voices, I was about to put their words down: and a voice from heaven came to my ears, saying, Keep secret the things which the seven thunders said, and do not put them in writing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);"><p>10:4 七雷发声之后，我正要写出来，就听见从天上有声音说，七雷所说的你要封上，不可写出来。
